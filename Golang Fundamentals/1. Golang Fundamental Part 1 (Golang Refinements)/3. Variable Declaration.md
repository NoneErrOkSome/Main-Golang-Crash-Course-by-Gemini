## Variable and Constant Declaration in Go: `var`, `const`, and `:=` 📜

In Go, declaring variables and constants is a fundamental aspect of writing programs. Go provides several ways to declare them, each with its specific use cases and rules. Understanding `var`, `const`, and the short assignment statement `:=` is key to writing idiomatic and clear Go code.

---

### 1. Declaring Variables with `var`

The `var` keyword is the most general way to declare one or more variables.

**Syntax:**

- `var variableName type` (declares a variable of a specific type, initialized to its zero value)
- `var variableName type = initialValue` (declares and initializes with a specific type)
- `var variableName = initialValue` (declares and initializes, type is inferred from `initialValue`)




#### a. Declaration with Type Only (Zero Value)

If you declare a variable with its type but without an initial value, Go automatically initializes it to its **zero value**.

- `0` for numeric types
- `false` for boolean types
- `""` (empty string) for strings
- `nil` for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var count int       // Initialized to 0
	var price float64   // Initialized to 0.0
	var isActive bool   // Initialized to false
	var message string    // Initialized to ""
	var userPointer *int // Initialized to nil

	fmt.Println("count:", count)
	fmt.Println("price:", price)
	fmt.Println("isActive:", isActive)
	fmt.Printf("message: \"%s\"\n", message)
	fmt.Println("userPointer:", userPointer)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
count: 0
price: 0
isActive: false
message: ""
userPointer: <nil>
```

#### b. Declaration with Type and Initializer

You can specify both the type and an initial value.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var name string = "Go Programmer"
	var version int = 1
	fmt.Println("Name:", name, "- Version:", version)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Name: Go Programmer - Version: 1
```

#### c. Declaration with Initializer (Type Inference)

If an initializer is present, Go can infer the type of the variable, so you can omit the type in the declaration.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var greeting = "Hello, world!" // Type string is inferred
	var year = 2025               // Type int is inferred
	var pi = 3.14159              // Type float64 is inferred

	fmt.Printf("greeting is of type %T, value: %s\n", greeting, greeting)
	fmt.Printf("year is of type %T, value: %d\n", year, year)
	fmt.Printf("pi is of type %T, value: %f\n", pi, pi)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
greeting is of type string, value: Hello, world!
year is of type int, value: 2025
pi is of type float64, value: 3.141590
```

#### d. Declaring Multiple Variables with `var`

You can declare multiple variables at once:

- On a single line, if they are of the same type or if types are inferred.
- In a block, for better organization.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Package-level variable declarations (must use var or const)
var (
	appName    = "MyApp"
	appVersion = "1.0.1"
	isEnabled  = true
)

func main() {
	// Multiple variables of the same type
	var x, y, z int = 1, 2, 3
	fmt.Println("x, y, z:", x, y, z)

	// Multiple variables with type inference on one line
	var host, port, protocol = "localhost", 8080, "http"
	fmt.Printf("%s://%s:%d\n", protocol, host, port)

	// Using package-level variables
	fmt.Println("Application:", appName, "Version:", appVersion, "Enabled:", isEnabled)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
x, y, z: 1 2 3
http://localhost:8080
Application: MyApp Version: 1.0.1 Enabled: true
```

`var` can be used both at the package level (outside functions) and within functions.

### 2. Declaring Constants with `const`

Constants are used to declare values that are fixed and cannot be changed during the program's execution. Their values must be known at compile time.

**Syntax:**

- `const constantName type = value` (typed constant)
- `const constantName = value` (untyped constant)

#### a. Purpose of Constants

Constants improve code readability and maintainability by giving meaningful names to fixed values (e.g., mathematical constants, configuration parameters that don't change). The compiler also enforces their immutability.

#### b. Typed vs. Untyped Constants

- **Typed constants** have a specific type defined at declaration.
- **Untyped constants** have an "ideal" type (like an ideal number, boolean, or string). Their actual type is determined by the context in which they are used. This provides flexibility and precision, especially for numeric constants.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const GlobalGreeting string = "Welcome!" // Typed string constant (package level)

func main() {
	const Pi = 3.14159265359 // Untyped floating-point constant
	const TimeoutSeconds = 10   // Untyped integer constant

	fmt.Println(GlobalGreeting)

	var circleRadius float64 = 5.0
	// Pi (untyped) can be used with float64 here because it's compatible
	circumference := 2 * Pi * circleRadius
	fmt.Printf("Circumference (float64): %f\n", circumference)

	// TimeoutSeconds (untyped) can be used as an int here
	var countdown int = TimeoutSeconds
	fmt.Println("Countdown starts from:", countdown)

	// If Pi was typed as, say, float32, it might lose precision or require conversion
	// const TypedPiAsFloat32 float32 = 3.14159265359
	// var anotherRadius float64 = 5.0
	// circumference2 := 2 * TypedPiAsFloat32 * anotherRadius // Error: Mismatched types float32 and float64
	// circumference2 := 2 * float64(TypedPiAsFloat32) * anotherRadius // Requires conversion
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Welcome!
Circumference (float64): 31.415927
Countdown starts from: 10
```

Most constants in Go are left untyped for greater flexibility.

#### c. `iota` for Enumerated Constants

The `iota` identifier is used in `const` declarations to create a sequence of related values, typically starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent constant in the block.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	Sunday = iota // 0
	Monday        // 1 (iota increments)
	Tuesday       // 2
	Wednesday     // 3
	Thursday      // 4
	Friday        // 5
	Saturday      // 6
)

const (
	// Bitwise permissions
	Read    = 1 << iota // 1 << 0 == 1
	Write               // 1 << 1 == 2
	Execute             // 1 << 2 == 4
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Sunday:", Sunday, "Monday:", Monday)
	fmt.Println("Read permission:", Read)
	fmt.Println("Write permission:", Write)
	fmt.Println("Execute permission:", Execute)
	fmt.Println("Read & Write:", Read|Write)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Sunday: 0 Monday: 1
Read permission: 1
Write permission: 2
Execute permission: 4
Read & Write: 3
```

`const` can be used both at the package level and within functions.

### 3. Short Assignment Statement `:=`

The short assignment statement `:=` is a concise way to declare and initialize variables **inside functions**. It cannot be used at the package level.

Syntax:

variableName := initialValue

The type of `variableName` is inferred from `initialValue`.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Declare and initialize using short assignment
	name := "Alice"          // Type string inferred
	age := 30              // Type int inferred
	isDeveloper := true    // Type bool inferred
	salary := 75000.50     // Type float64 inferred

	fmt.Printf("%s (age %d) is a developer: %t. Salary: %.2f\n",
		name, age, isDeveloper, salary)

	// Multiple assignments
	width, height := 800, 600
	fmt.Printf("Dimensions: %d x %d\n", width, height)

	// Re-declaration vs. New Variable
	// When using :=, at least one variable on the left side must be new.
	// 'err' is new here, 'width' is just being reassigned.
	width, err := 500, "some error" // This is valid if err was not previously declared in this scope
	// If width and err were both already declared in this scope, you would use =
	// width, err = 500, "some error" // (Assuming err was already declared)

	fmt.Println("New width:", width, "Error:", err)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Alice (age 30) is a developer: true. Salary: 75000.50
Dimensions: 800 x 600
New width: 500 Error: some error
```

**Key characteristics of `:=`:**

- **Declaration and Initialization:** It combines both steps.
- **Type Inference:** Always infers the type.
- **Function Scope Only:** Cannot be used for package-level variables.
- **"New" Variable Requirement:** In an assignment like `v1, v2 := e1, e2`, at least one of the variables on the left (`v1` or `v2`) must be newly declared in the current scope. If all variables on the left are already declared, you must use the standard assignment operator (`=`).

### 4. Comparison and When to Use Which

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**var variableName type**|**var variableName = value**|**constantName := value**|**const constantName = value**|
|**Purpose**|Declare variable|Declare & init variable|Declare & init variable|Declare constant|
|**Explicit Type**|Required|Optional (inferred)|No (always inferred)|Optional (can be untyped)|
|**Initialization**|Zero value|Explicit|Explicit|Explicit (compile-time)|
|**Scope**|Package or Function|Package or Function|Function only|Package or Function|
|**Immutability**|Mutable|Mutable|Mutable|Immutable (compile-time)|
|**Conciseness**|Less concise|Moderately concise|Most concise|Moderately concise|
|**Common Use Case**|Zero-value init, Package-level|Package-level with init|Function-level init|Fixed values, Enums|

**General Guidelines:**

1. **Inside Functions:**
    
    - Prefer `:=` for declaring and initializing local variables when the initial value is known. It's concise and idiomatic Go.
        
        Code snippet
        
	    ```go
        func process() {
            data := fetchData()
            if data == nil { // assuming fetchData can return nil
                // ...
            }
        }
        ```
        
    - Use `var` if you need to declare a local variable without an immediate initializer (to rely on its zero value) or if you want to be very explicit about its type for clarity in complex situations (though type inference is usually clear enough).
        
        Code snippet
        
	    ```go
        func setup() {
            var config MyConfig // MyConfig will be zero-valued
            // ... later populate config
        }
        ```




2. **Package Level:**
    
    - You **must** use `var` or `const` for declarations outside functions. `:=` is not allowed here.
    - Use `var` for package-level variables that might be modified or need their zero value.
    - Use `const` for package-level values that are fixed.
3. **Constants:**
    
    - Always use `const` for values that should not change during the program's execution (e.g., mathematical constants, fixed limits, version numbers, enumerated values with `iota`).

### 5. Best Practices and Go Idioms

- **Readability:** Choose the declaration style that makes your code clearest. While `:=` is concise, sometimes an explicit `var` with a type can improve understanding if the inferred type isn't obvious from the initializer.
- **Minimize Scope:** Declare variables in the smallest scope possible. If a variable is only needed inside a loop or an `if` block, declare it there.
- **Unused Variables:** Go compiler enforces that all declared local variables must be used. This helps prevent bugs and keeps code clean.
- **Group Declarations:** For multiple related package-level `var` or `const` declarations, group them in a block for better organization.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    var (
        defaultHost = "localhost"
        defaultPort = 9090
    )
    
    const (
        MaxRetries = 3
        BaseURL    = "https://api.example.com"
    )
    ```
    

By understanding these different declaration methods, you can write Go code that is not only functional but also clear, idiomatic, and maintainable.
