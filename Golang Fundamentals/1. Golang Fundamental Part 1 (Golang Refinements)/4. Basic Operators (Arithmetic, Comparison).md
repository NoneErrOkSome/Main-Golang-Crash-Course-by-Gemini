## Basic Operators in Go: Arithmetic and Comparison 🔢⚖️

Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more values (called operands). Go, like other programming languages, has a rich set of operators. This document focuses on two fundamental categories: arithmetic and comparison operators.

---

### Introduction to Operators in Go

In Go, operators allow you to manipulate variables and values. For example, you can add numbers, compare values to make decisions, and more. Most operators in Go are binary operators (taking two operands, e.g., `a + b`) or unary operators (taking one operand, e.g., `-a`).

Understanding how these operators work, especially with Go's strong type system, is crucial for writing correct and efficient code.

---

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations. Go supports the standard arithmetic operations.

**Important Note on Types:** Go is very strict about types in operations. You generally cannot perform arithmetic operations directly between variables of different numeric types without explicit type conversion.

#### a. Addition (`+`)

Adds two numeric operands. It can also be used for string concatenation.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Numeric addition
	sum1 := 10 + 5       // int + int
	fmt.Println("10 + 5 =", sum1)

	var num1 int = 20
	var num2 int = 15
	sum2 := num1 + num2
	fmt.Printf("%d + %d = %d\n", num1, num2, sum2)

	floatSum := 3.14 + 2.71 // float64 + float64
	fmt.Println("3.14 + 2.71 =", floatSum)

	// String concatenation
	firstName := "Go"
	lastName := "Lang"
	fullName := firstName + " " + lastName
	fmt.Println("Full name:", fullName)

	// Type mismatch (would cause a compile error if uncommented)
	// var myInt int = 5
	// var myFloat float64 = 2.5
	// result := myInt + myFloat // ERROR: invalid operation: myInt + myFloat (mismatched types int and float64)
	// To fix, convert:
	// result := float64(myInt) + myFloat
	// fmt.Println("Fixed result:", result)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
10 + 5 = 15
20 + 15 = 35
3.14 + 2.71 = 5.85
Full name: Go Lang
```

#### b. Subtraction (`-`)

Subtracts the second numeric operand from the first.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	difference1 := 100 - 42
	fmt.Println("100 - 42 =", difference1)

	var principal float64 = 1000.0
	var interest float64 = 50.5
	remaining := principal - interest
	fmt.Printf("%.2f - %.2f = %.2f\n", principal, interest, remaining)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
100 - 42 = 58
1000.00 - 50.50 = 949.50
```

#### c. Multiplication (`*`)

Multiplies two numeric operands.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	product1 := 7 * 6
	fmt.Println("7 * 6 =", product1)

	var quantity int = 5
	var pricePerItem float64 = 10.25
	totalCost := float64(quantity) * pricePerItem // quantity converted to float64
	fmt.Printf("Total cost for %d items: %.2f\n", quantity, totalCost)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
7 * 6 = 42
Total cost for 5 items: 51.25
```

#### d. Division (`/`)

Divides the first numeric operand by the second. The behavior depends on the types of the operands:

- **Integer Division:** If both operands are integers, the result is an integer, and the fractional part is truncated (discarded).
- **Floating-Point Division:** If at least one operand is a floating-point number (after necessary conversions), the result is a floating-point number.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Integer division
	intResult1 := 10 / 3 // Result is 3 (fractional part truncated)
	fmt.Println("10 / 3 (integer) =", intResult1)

	intResult2 := 9 / 2 // Result is 4
	fmt.Println("9 / 2 (integer) =", intResult2)

	// Floating-point division
	floatResult1 := 10.0 / 3.0
	fmt.Println("10.0 / 3.0 (float) =", floatResult1)

	var numerator float64 = 7
	var denominator int = 2
	floatResult2 := numerator / float64(denominator) // denominator converted to float64
	fmt.Println("7.0 / 2.0 (mixed, converted) =", floatResult2)

	// Division by zero
	// var x = 10 / 0 // Compile-time error for integer division by literal zero
	// var y float64 = 10.0 / 0.0 // Runtime: +Inf (IEEE 754 standard)
	// fmt.Println(y)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
10 / 3 (integer) = 3
9 / 2 (integer) = 4
10.0 / 3.0 (float) = 3.3333333333333335
7.0 / 2.0 (mixed, converted) = 3.5
```

Division by zero with integers is a compile-time error if the divisor is a literal `0`. For floating-point numbers, division by zero results in `+Inf`, `-Inf`, or `NaN` (Not a Number) according to IEEE 754 standards.

#### e. Modulo (`%`)

Returns the remainder of an integer division. This operator can only be used with integer operands.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	remainder1 := 10 % 3 // 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1
	fmt.Println("10 % 3 =", remainder1)

	remainder2 := 17 % 5 // 17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2
	fmt.Println("17 % 5 =", remainder2)

	remainder3 := 20 % 4 // 20 divided by 4 is 5 with a remainder of 0
	fmt.Println("20 % 4 =", remainder3)

	// Modulo with negative numbers: the sign of the result follows the sign of the dividend (the first operand).
	fmt.Println("-10 % 3 =", -10 % 3) // -1
	fmt.Println("10 % -3 =", 10 % -3) //  1
}
```

**Output:**

```go
10 % 3 = 1
17 % 5 = 2
20 % 4 = 0
-10 % 3 = -1
10 % -3 = 1
```

#### f. Increment (`++`) and Decrement (`--`) Statements

Go has increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators, but they work as **statements**, not expressions. This means they don't return a value and can only be applied to variables directly (not as part of a larger expression). They increment or decrement the variable by 1.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	counter := 5
	fmt.Println("Initial counter:", counter)

	counter++ // Increment counter by 1 (counter is now 6)
	fmt.Println("After counter++:", counter)

	counter-- // Decrement counter by 1 (counter is now 5)
	fmt.Println("After counter--:", counter)

	// Invalid usage (compile errors if uncommented):
	// value := counter++ // ERROR: counter++ is a statement, not an expression
	// fmt.Println(++counter) // ERROR: Go only supports postfix ++/--
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Initial counter: 5
After counter++: 6
After counter--: 5
```

Go only supports postfix `++` and `--` (e.g., `variable++`), not prefix (e.g., `++variable`).

### 2. Comparison Operators (Relational Operators)

Comparison operators are used to compare two operands and return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

**Important Note on Comparability:** Operands must be comparable. Generally, this means they must be of the same type, or one can be an untyped constant that is compatible with the other's type. Certain types like slices, maps, and functions are not directly comparable using `==` or `!=` (except against `nil`).

#### a. Equal To (`==`)

Returns `true` if the operands are equal.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("5 == 5 is", 5 == 5)     // true
	fmt.Println("5 == 6 is", 5 == 6)     // false
	fmt.Println("'Go' == 'Go' is", "Go" == "Go") // true
	fmt.Println("'Go' == 'go' is", "Go" == "go") // false (strings are case-sensitive)

	var a int = 10
	var b int = 10
	fmt.Printf("%d == %d is %t\n", a, b, a == b)

	// Comparing different types (would cause a compile error if uncommented):
	// var x int = 5
	// var y float64 = 5.0
	// fmt.Println(x == y) // ERROR: invalid operation: x == y (mismatched types int and float64)
	// To fix, convert:
	// fmt.Println(float64(x) == y)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
5 == 5 is true
5 == 6 is false
'Go' == 'Go' is true
'Go' == 'go' is false
10 == 10 is true
```

#### b. Not Equal To (`!=`)

Returns `true` if the operands are not equal.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("5 != 5 is", 5 != 5)     // false
	fmt.Println("5 != 6 is", 5 != 6)     // true
	fmt.Println("'Hello' != 'World' is", "Hello" != "World") // true
}
```

**Output:**

```go
5 != 5 is false
5 != 6 is true
'Hello' != 'World' is true
```

#### c. Greater Than (`>`)

Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Typically used with numeric types and strings (lexicographical comparison).

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("10 > 5 is", 10 > 5)   // true
	fmt.Println("5 > 10 is", 5 > 10)   // false
	fmt.Println("5 > 5 is", 5 > 5)     // false

	// String comparison (lexicographical)
	fmt.Println("'apple' > 'banana' is", "apple" > "banana") // false ('a' comes before 'b')
	fmt.Println("'zebra' > 'yak' is", "zebra" > "yak")     // true ('z' comes after 'y')
}
```

**Output:**

```go
10 > 5 is true
5 > 10 is false
5 > 5 is false
'apple' > 'banana' is false
'zebra' > 'yak' is true
```

#### d. Less Than (`<`)

Returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("5 < 10 is", 5 < 10)   // true
	fmt.Println("10 < 5 is", 10 < 5)   // false
	fmt.Println("5 < 5 is", 5 < 5)     // false

	fmt.Println("'cat' < 'dog' is", "cat" < "dog") // true
}
```

**Output:**

```go
5 < 10 is true
10 < 5 is false
5 < 5 is false
'cat' < 'dog' is true
```

#### e. Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)

Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("10 >= 5 is", 10 >= 5)   // true
	fmt.Println("5 >= 5 is", 5 >= 5)     // true
	fmt.Println("5 >= 10 is", 5 >= 10)   // false
}
```

**Output:**

```go
10 >= 5 is true
5 >= 5 is true
5 >= 10 is false
```

#### f. Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)

Returns `true` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("5 <= 10 is", 5 <= 10)   // true
	fmt.Println("5 <= 5 is", 5 <= 5)     // true
	fmt.Println("10 <= 5 is", 10 <= 5)   // false
}
```

**Output:**

```go
5 <= 10 is true
5 <= 5 is true
10 <= 5 is false
```

#### Comparability of Different Types:

- **Numeric Types:** All numeric types are comparable to other values of the same numeric type.
- **Strings:** Strings are comparable lexicographically (byte by byte).
- **Booleans:** Booleans are comparable (`true` is not equal to `false`).
- **Pointers:** Pointers are comparable. Two pointers are equal if they point to the same variable or if both are `nil`.
- **Channels:** Channel values are comparable. Two channel values are equal if they were created by the same call to `make` or if both are `nil`.
- **Interfaces:** Interface values are comparable. Two interface values are equal if they have identical dynamic types and equal dynamic values, or if1 both are `nil`.
- **Structs:** Struct values are comparable if all their fields are comparable. Two struct values are equal if their corresponding non-blank fields are equal.2
- **Arrays:** Array values are comparable if values of the array element type are comparable. Two array values are equal if their corresponding elements are equal.3
- **Not Comparable:** Slices, maps, and function values are **not** comparable using `==` or `!=` (except against `nil`). Comparing them directly will result in a compile-time error.

---

### Summary

- **Arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) perform mathematical calculations. Go's strong typing requires explicit conversions for operations between different numeric types. Integer division truncates.
- **Increment/Decrement operators** (`++`, `--`) are statements, not expressions, and are postfix only.
- **Comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) compare operands and produce a boolean result. Operands must be comparable, and Go is strict about type compatibility in comparisons.

Understanding these basic operators is essential for performing calculations, making decisions, and controlling the flow of your Go programs.
