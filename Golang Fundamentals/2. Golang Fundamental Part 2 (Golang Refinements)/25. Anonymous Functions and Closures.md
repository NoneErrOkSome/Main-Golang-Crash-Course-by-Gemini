## Anonymous Functions and Closures in Go ðŸŽ­ðŸ”—

Go supports **anonymous functions**, which are functions defined without a name. These are particularly useful for short, self-contained operations or when functions are treated as values (e.g., passed as arguments or returned from other functions). When an anonymous function accesses variables defined outside its own body, it forms a **closure**, "closing over" those variables.

---

### 1. Anonymous Functions

An anonymous function is declared inline without a specific function name. It can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another function, or returned as a value from a function.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```
func(parameterList) (returnTypeList) {
    // function body
    return // optional
}
```

**Key Characteristics:**

- **No Name:** Defined directly where it's needed.
- **Can Be Assigned to Variables:** If assigned to a variable, that variable can then be used to call the function.
- **Can Be Immediately Invoked:** Defined and called in the same expression (IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

**Example 1: Assigning to a Variable**

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Define an anonymous function and assign it to the variable 'greet'
	greet := func(name string) {
		fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
	}

	greet("Alice") // Call the anonymous function via the variable
	greet("Bob")

	add := func(a, b int) int {
		return a + b
	}
	sum := add(10, 20)
	fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Sum: 30
```

Example 2: Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

An anonymous function can be defined and executed immediately. This is useful for encapsulating a piece of logic or limiting the scope of variables.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Define and immediately invoke an anonymous function
	result := func(a, b int) int {
		fmt.Println("Calculating sum inside IIFE...")
		return a + b
	}(5, 3) // Call it right after defining with arguments (5, 3)

	fmt.Println("Result from IIFE:", result)

	// Another IIFE for a side effect
	func() {
		message := "This runs immediately!"
		fmt.Println(message)
	}()
}
```

**Output:**

```
Calculating sum inside IIFE...
Result from IIFE: 8
This runs immediately!
```

Example 3: Passing Anonymous Functions as Arguments

Functions that accept other functions as parameters are called higher-order functions. Anonymous functions are commonly used in such cases.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

// operate takes two integers and a function that performs an operation on them
func operate(a, b int, op func(int, int) int) int {
	fmt.Printf("Operating with %d and %d...\n", a, b)
	return op(a, b)
}

func main() {
	// Pass an anonymous function for addition
	sum := operate(10, 5, func(x, y int) int {
		return x + y
	})
	fmt.Println("Sum result:", sum)

	// Pass an anonymous function for multiplication
	product := operate(10, 5, func(x, y int) int {
		return x * y
	})
	fmt.Println("Product result:", product)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Operating with 10 and 5...
Sum result: 15
Operating with 10 and 5...
Product result: 50
```

---

### 2. Closures

A **closure** is a function value that **references variables from outside its own function body** (from its surrounding lexical scope). The function "closes over" these variables. This means the function can access and modify these variables even if the function is executed after the surrounding function has finished.

- The closure "remembers" the environment in which it was created.
- Each closure instance has its own unique binding to the captured variables.

**Example 1: Basic Closure**

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

// intSequence returns a function (a closure) that returns successive integers.
func intSequence() func() int {
	i := 0 // 'i' is captured by the closure
	return func() int {
		i++ // The anonymous function can access and modify 'i'
		return i
	}
}

func main() {
	// nextInt is a closure; it has its own 'i'
	nextInt := intSequence()

	fmt.Println(nextInt()) // Output: 1
	fmt.Println(nextInt()) // Output: 2
	fmt.Println(nextInt()) // Output: 3

	// newInts is another closure; it has its own independent 'i'
	newInts := intSequence()
	fmt.Println(newInts()) // Output: 1
	fmt.Println(newInts()) // Output: 2
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
1
2
```

In this example, each call to `intSequence()` creates a new closure with its own independent `i` variable. The anonymous function `func() int { i++; return i }` "closes over" the `i` from its parent `intSequence`'s scope.

Example 2: Closure Capturing Function Parameters

Closures can also capture the parameters of their enclosing function.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

// makeGreeter returns a function that greets with a specific prefix.
func makeGreeter(prefix string) func(string) string {
	// The returned anonymous function closes over 'prefix'.
	return func(name string) string {
		return prefix + " " + name + "!"
	}
}

func main() {
	greetHello := makeGreeter("Hello") // prefix is "Hello" for this closure
	greetHola := makeGreeter("Hola")   // prefix is "Hola" for this closure

	fmt.Println(greetHello("Alice")) // Output: Hello Alice!
	fmt.Println(greetHola("Bob"))    // Output: Hola Bob!

	fmt.Println(greetHello("Charlie")) // Still uses "Hello"
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Alice!
Hola Bob!
Hello Charlie!
```

Example 3: Closures and Loop Variables (Common Pitfall and Solution)

When creating closures inside a loop that capture the loop variable, you need to be careful. If the closure captures the loop variable directly, all closures created in the loop will reference the same variable, which will have its final value after the loop finishes.

Code snippet

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// --- Incorrect loop variable capture ---
	fmt.Println("Incorrect loop variable capture:")
	var wrongFuncs []func()
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		// 'i' is captured by reference. By the time these functions run,
		// the loop will have finished and 'i' will be 3.
		wrongFuncs = append(wrongFuncs, func() {
			fmt.Printf("Value of i (wrong): %d\n", i)
		})
	}

	for _, f := range wrongFuncs {
		f()
	}
	// Expected (but incorrect) output might be:
	// Value of i (wrong): 0
	// Value of i (wrong): 1
	// Value of i (wrong): 2
	// Actual output will likely be:
	// Value of i (wrong): 3
	// Value of i (wrong): 3
	// Value of i (wrong): 3

	// --- Correct loop variable capture ---
	fmt.Println("\nCorrect loop variable capture:")
	var correctFuncs []func()
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		// Solution 1: Pass 'i' as an argument to the closure
		// This creates a new variable 'val' for each iteration.
		val := i
		correctFuncs = append(correctFuncs, func() {
			fmt.Printf("Value of val (correct): %d\n", val)
		})
	}

	for _, f := range correctFuncs {
		f()
	}

	// Solution 2 (often used with goroutines): Pass as argument to an immediately invoked function
	// that returns the closure, or directly to the goroutine function.
	fmt.Println("\nCorrect loop variable capture (goroutine style parameter passing):")
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		// Capture 'i' by value for each goroutine
		go func(capturedI int) {
			// This example doesn't guarantee order due to concurrency,
			// but each goroutine gets its own 'capturedI'.
			fmt.Printf("Goroutine with capturedI: %d\n", capturedI)
		}(i) // Pass 'i' as an argument here
	}
	time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond) // Give goroutines time to run (simple sync)
}
```

**Output (order of goroutine output may vary):**

```
Incorrect loop variable capture:
Value of i (wrong): 3
Value of i (wrong): 3
Value of i (wrong): 3

Correct loop variable capture:
Value of val (correct): 0
Value of val (correct): 1
Value of val (correct): 2

Correct loop variable capture (goroutine style parameter passing):
Goroutine with capturedI: 2
Goroutine with capturedI: 0
Goroutine with capturedI: 1
```

The key to correct loop variable capture is to ensure that each closure instance gets its own copy of the variable's value _at that iteration_, rather than all sharing a reference to the single loop variable.

### Use Cases for Anonymous Functions and Closures

- **Short, Simple Functions:** When a named function feels like overkill.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Passing functions as arguments (e.g., to sorting functions, event handlers, or custom iteration logic).
- **Returning Functions from Functions:** Creating specialized functions (function factories) like `makeGreeter` or `intSequence`.
- **State Encapsulation:** Closures can maintain state between calls (like the `i` in `intSequence`) without needing to use global variables or pass state around explicitly.
- **Goroutines:** Often used to launch concurrent operations with `go func() { ... }()`.
- **`defer` Statements:** Sometimes a deferred action is complex enough to warrant an anonymous function.

---

### Summary

- **Anonymous functions** are functions without names, defined inline. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or immediately invoked.
- **Closures** are a special kind of anonymous function (or any function value) that "closes over" variables from its surrounding lexical scope. It can access and modify these captured variables.
- Each closure instance maintains its own set of captured variables.
- Be mindful of how loop variables are captured in closures; pass the loop variable as an argument to the closure or assign it to a new variable within the loop to capture its value per iteration correctly.
- Anonymous functions and closures are powerful tools in Go for writing flexible, concise, and expressive code, especially when dealing with higher-order functions and maintaining state.
