Of course! It's always a good idea to review the fundamentals. Here is a complete explanation of Bubble Sort from the beginning.

## The Main Idea of Bubble Sort ğŸ«§

**Bubble Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm.

Its main strategy is to repeatedly step through the list, **compare side-by-side neighbors**, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. It keeps doing this until the list is perfectly sorted.

## The "Lining Up Toys" Analogy

Imagine you have a line of toys of different sizes that you want to sort from smallest to biggest.

The rule of the Bubble Sort game is: **You can only compare two toys that are standing right next to each other.**

1. You start at the beginning of the line and compare the first two toys. If the taller one is on the left, you swap them.
2. You move one step to the right and compare the second and third toys. Again, you swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. You continue this until you reach the end of the line.

After one full pass down the line, the **biggest toy will have "bubbled up"** to its correct spot at the very end! You then repeat the whole process for the rest of the unsorted toys.

## A Quick Example

Let's sort the list: `[4, 2, 5, 1]`

**Pass 1:**

- Compare **4** and **2**. They are in the wrong order. Swap them. -> `[2, 4, 5, 1]`
- Compare **4** and **5**. They are in the correct order. Do nothing.
- Compare **5** and **1**. They are in the wrong order. Swap them. -> `[2, 4, 1, 5]`
- _End of Pass 1. The `5` is now sorted._

**Pass 2:**

- Compare **2** and **4**. They are in the correct order. Do nothing.
- Compare **4** and **1**. They are in the wrong order. Swap them. -> `[2, 1, 4, 5]`
- _End of Pass 2. The `4` is now sorted._

**Pass 3:**

- Compare **2** and **1**. They are in the wrong order. Swap them. -> `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
- _End of Pass 3. The list is now fully sorted!_

## The Python Code


```python
def bubble_sort(numbers_list):
    # n holds the total count of numbers
    n = len(numbers_list)

    # The outer loop 'i' controls the number of rounds we need to do.
    for i in range(n):

        # The inner loop 'j' is the worker that walks down the list
        # comparing neighbors in each round.
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):

            # If the number on the left is bigger than the number on the right...
            if numbers_list[j] > numbers_list[j + 1]:
                # ...we swap them!
                numbers_list[j], numbers_list[j + 1] = numbers_list[j + 1], numbers_list[j]
    
    return numbers_list

# --- How to use it ---
my_numbers = [8, 2, 0, 1, 5]
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(my_numbers)
print(f"The sorted list is: {sorted_numbers}")
```

## Big O Rating

Bubble Sort has a "slowness rating" of **O(nÂ²)** (Very, VERY Slow). This is because it uses a loop inside another loop (nested loops) to do its job.
