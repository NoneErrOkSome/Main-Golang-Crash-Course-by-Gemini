That's great! You now have two fundamental sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, in your Go toolbox.

Now that you are an expert at sorting a list, the perfect next step is to learn how to **use that superpower**. The main reason we sort data is to be able to find things in it incredibly fast.

## What's Next: Binary Search in Go

Our next lesson will be to implement the **Binary Search** algorithm in Go.

Remember the "number guessing game" or the "phone book" analogy? This is that algorithm! Instead of checking items one-by-one like [[01 - Linear Search]], we will jump to the middle of a **sorted list** and cut our search area in half with every single guess.

We will write a Go function that takes a sorted slice and a target number, and uses this "divide and conquer" strategy to find it. This is our first [[O(log n) - Excellent]] algorithm we will build together.

This is one of the most famous and important algorithms in computer science. Are you ready to build it?
