Excellent! Let's build one of the most powerful and efficient algorithms together.

Remember, Binary Search has one very important rule: it **must** be used on a **sorted list**.

We are going to write a Go function that takes a sorted slice and a target number, and finds the position of that number.

---

## Step 1: The Setup - Defining Our Search Area

First, we need to tell our program the "scope" or "search area" of the list. We do this with two variables that act as pointers or boundaries.

- A `low` boundary that starts at the very beginning (index `0`).
- A `high` boundary that starts at the very end (index `len(slice) - 1`).

Here's how we start our function in Go:

Go

```Go
func binarySearch(sortedSlice []int, target int) int {
    // Set up our boundaries at the start and end of the slice
    low := 0
    high := len(sortedSlice) - 1

    // ... our search logic will go here
}
```

---

## Step 2: The Loop - When to Keep Searching

We need to keep guessing as long as our search area is valid. A search area is valid as long as the `low` boundary has not crossed over the `high` boundary.

In Go, we use a `for` loop to do this. By only giving it a condition, it acts just like a `while` loop in other languages.

Go

```Go
    // Keep searching as long as low is less than or equal to high
    for low <= high {
        // All our guessing logic will go inside this loop
    }
```

If this loop finishes without us finding the number, it means the number isn't in the slice.

---

## Step 3: The Guess and The Decision

This is the "divide and conquer" magic that happens inside the loop. In every single round, we will:

1. **Find the middle index:** `mid := (low + high) / 2`
2. **Make a guess:** `guess := sortedSlice[mid]`
3. **Compare our guess** to the target and decide what to do.

There are only three possibilities:

- If our `guess` is correct, we found it!
- If our `guess` is too low, we know we can ignore the entire left half of our search area.
- If our `guess` is too high, we can ignore the entire right half.

---

## Putting It All Together: The Final Code

Now let's combine all those steps into the final, complete Go program.

Go

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

// binarySearch takes a sorted slice and a target number.
// It returns the index of the target, or -1 if it's not found.
func binarySearch(sortedSlice []int, target int) int {
    // 1. Set up the search area
    low := 0
    high := len(sortedSlice) - 1

    // 2. Keep searching as long as the search area is valid
    for low <= high {
        // 3. Find the middle and make a guess
        mid := (low + high) / 2
        guess := sortedSlice[mid]

        // 4. Compare the guess and shrink the search area
        if guess == target {
            return mid // Found it! Return its index.
        } else if guess < target {
            // Our guess was too low, so we search the right half
            low = mid + 1
        } else { // guess > target
            // Our guess was too high, so we search the left half
            high = mid - 1
        }
    }

    // If the loop finishes, low has crossed high, and the item wasn't in the list
    return -1
}

func main() {
    // Remember, the list MUST be sorted!
    mySortedNumbers := []int{2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72}
    numberToFind := 23

    foundAtIndex := binarySearch(mySortedNumbers, numberToFind)

    if foundAtIndex != -1 {
        fmt.Println("Found the number", numberToFind, "at index", foundAtIndex, "!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("The number", numberToFind, "was not in the list.")
    }
}
```

What do you think? Do you see how the `low` and `high` variables are used to shrink the search area until the target is found or the area disappears?
