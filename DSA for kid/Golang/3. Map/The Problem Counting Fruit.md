Excellent! I think you'll enjoy this.

We are going to solve a common problem that programmers face every day, and we'll use the Go data structures we just learned to do it.

## The Problem: Counting Fruits üçéüçåüçä

Imagine you have a list of fruits from a big shopping trip, and you want to count how many of each kind of fruit you bought.

For example, if your shopping list is:

[apple, banana, apple, orange, banana, apple]

The final count should be:

- `apple: 3`
- `banana: 2`
- `orange: 1`

### The Plan (Our Algorithm)

Before we write any code, let's think about how we would do this on paper.

1. Get a blank piece of paper. This will be where we write our counts.
2. Go through the shopping list one fruit at a time.
3. For each fruit, look at your paper. Have you seen this fruit before?
    - If **YES**, find its name and add one to its count.
    - If **NO**, write down the fruit's name for the first time and set its count to `1`.
4. When you're done with the shopping list, your paper will have the final counts.

## Choosing the Right Tool

Now, let's think about our Go data structures. To store our fruit counts, where we have a fruit **name** (like "apple") connected to a **count** (like `3`), which tool would be perfect?

A `[[01 - Array - The Line of Boxes]]` uses number indexes, so that's not right.

A **map** is perfect! We can use a `map[string]int` where the **key** is the fruit's name (`string`) and the **value** is the count (`int`).

## Let's Write the Go Code

Here is how we can write the Go code to follow our plan.

Go

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // This is our starting data, stored in a slice.
    shoppingList := []string{"apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"}

    // 1. Get a blank piece of paper.
    // We create an empty map to store our counts.
    fruitCounts := make(map[string]int)

    // 2. Go through the shopping list one fruit at a time.
    // This 'for loop' is a simple way to read each item from a slice.
    for _, fruit := range shoppingList {
        // The '_' here means "I don't need the index for this job."

        // 3. If we see a fruit, add one to its count.
        // Go has a wonderful trick for this! If we look up a key that
        // isn't in the map yet, Go pretends its value is 0.
        // So we can just add 1 to the count every time we see a fruit.
        fruitCounts[fruit] = fruitCounts[fruit] + 1
    }

    // 4. Print the final counts.
    fmt.Println("The final fruit counts are:")
    fmt.Println(fruitCounts)
}
```

### Running the Code

If you run this code, the output will be:

```Go
The final fruit counts are:
map[apple:3 banana:2 orange:1]
```

And that's it! We just used a **slice** to hold our starting data and a **map** to organize and count it. This is a very common and powerful programming pattern.

What do you think? Does it make sense how we used a map to solve this counting problem?
