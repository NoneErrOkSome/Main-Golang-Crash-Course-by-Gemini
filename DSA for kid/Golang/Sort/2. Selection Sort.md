Excellent! Let's dive into Selection Sort in Go.

Remember, the goal of Selection Sort is different from Bubble Sort. Its strategy is to find the **smallest number** in the unsorted part of the list and swap it to the beginning of that part.

## Selection Sort in Go

Here is the complete code. You will see that the outer loop and the `len()` function look familiar, but the logic inside is all about the "find the smallest" strategy.

### The Go Code for Selection Sort

Go

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

// This function takes a slice of integers to sort.
func selectionSort(numbers []int) {
    // n holds the total count of numbers.
    n := len(numbers)

    // The outer loop 'i' moves the boundary between the sorted part (on the left)
    // and the unsorted part (on the right). We are trying to fill the spot at index 'i'.
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        
        // --- Find the position of the smallest number in the unsorted part ---
        
        // We start by ASSUMING the smallest number is at the beginning of our search area.
        // 'minPosition' is our "sticky note" to remember where the smallest number is.
        minPosition := i
        
        // The inner loop 'j' is the "scanner". Its job is to look at every
        // other number in the unsorted section to see if we can find a smaller one.
        for j := i + 1; j < n; j++ {
            
            // If we find a number that is smaller than the one at our 'minPosition'...
            if numbers[j] < numbers[minPosition] {
                // ...we update our sticky note with this new, better position.
                minPosition = j
            }
        }
        
        // --- The "Find" part is over. Now for the Swap. ---
        
        // After the inner loop has finished its scan, 'minPosition' holds the
        // exact location of the smallest number. We do ONE single swap
        // to move it to the correct place at the front of the unsorted section.
        numbers[i], numbers[minPosition] = numbers[minPosition], numbers[i]
    }
}

// The main function is where our program starts.
func main() {
    // We create a slice of integers.
    myNumbers := []int{8, 2, 0, 1, 5}
    fmt.Println("Original slice:", myNumbers)

    // We call our function to sort the slice.
    selectionSort(myNumbers)

    // Print the slice after it has been sorted.
    fmt.Println("Sorted slice:  ", myNumbers)
}
```

If you were to run this code, the output would be:

```Go
Original slice: [8 2 0 1 5]
Sorted slice:   [0 1 2 5 8]
```

Do you see how this code follows the "sorting a hand of cards" analogy? The inner `j` loop **finds** the lowest card, and the single swap at the end **moves** it to the correct spot.

What do you think of this strategy compared to Bubble Sort?
