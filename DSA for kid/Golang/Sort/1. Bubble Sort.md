Excellent question!

The next step is to take an algorithm you already understand very well, **Bubble Sort**, and see how we write it using the flexible Go **slice** we just learned about. This is a great way to see how the main _idea_ of an algorithm stays the same, even in a new language.

## Bubble Sort with a Go Slice

Our goal is to write a function in Go that takes a messy slice of numbers and sorts it using the Bubble Sort strategy.

You will see that the logic inside is almost exactly the same as the Python version, just with Go's grammar.

### The Go Code for Bubble Sort

Here is the complete code. Let's look at it, and then we'll break it down.

Go

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

// This function takes a slice of integers, which is shown by []int
func bubbleSort(numbers []int) {
    // n holds the total count of numbers. This is just like Python's len().
    n := len(numbers)

    // The outer loop 'i' is our "Round Manager".
    // It makes sure we do enough passes.
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {

        // The inner loop 'j' is our "Worker" that compares neighbors.
        // The math (n - i - 1) is exactly the same to make the path shorter each round.
        for j := 0; j < n-i-1; j++ {

            // The comparison logic is identical to Python's.
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1] {

                // The "magic swap" looks exactly the same as in Python!
                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]
            }
        }
    }
}

// The main function is where our program starts.
func main() {
    // We create a slice of integers.
    // Notice we don't have to say the size, so it's a slice, not an array.
    myNumbers := []int{8, 2, 0, 1, 5}
    fmt.Println("Original slice:", myNumbers)

    // We call our function to sort the slice.
    bubbleSort(myNumbers)

    // Print the slice after it has been sorted.
    fmt.Println("Sorted slice:  ", myNumbers)
}
```

If you were to run this code in a Go environment, the output would be:

```
Original slice: [8 2 0 1 5]
Sorted slice:   [0 1 2 5 8]
```

What do you think? Does seeing the same Bubble Sort logic—the two loops and the swap—in Go make sense? The core idea is the same, just with slightly different grammar for the `for` loops.
