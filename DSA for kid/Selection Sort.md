Of course! Reviewing concepts is a great way to make sure you remember them well. Here is a complete explanation of Selection Sort again.

## The Main Idea of Selection Sort 🃏

**Selection Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that has a different strategy from Bubble Sort.

Its main idea is to:

> **Find the absolute smallest number in the unsorted part of the list and swap it to the beginning of that part.**

## The "Sorting a Hand of Cards" Analogy

The easiest way to imagine Selection Sort is to think about how you might sort a hand of playing cards.

1. You scan your **entire hand** to find the very lowest card (let's say it's a 2).
2. You pick it up and place it on the far left. That first position is now "locked" and considered sorted.
3. Ignoring the locked card, you scan the **rest of your hand** to find the next lowest card (a 3).
4. You pick it up and place it in the second spot from the left. That position is now locked.
5. You repeat this process—finding the smallest among the remaining cards and moving it to the correct spot—until your whole hand is in order.

## A Quick Example

Let's sort the list: `[8, 2, 0, 1, 5]`

**Round 1:**

- Scan the whole list `[8, 2, 0, 1, 5]`. The smallest number is **0**.
- Swap the `0` with the number at the beginning of our search area (the `8`).
- Result: `[0, 2, 8, 1, 5]`. The `0` is now sorted and locked.

**Round 2:**

- Scan the unsorted part `[2, 8, 1, 5]`. The smallest number is **1**.
- Swap the `1` with the number at the beginning of this section (the `2`).
- Result: `[0, 1, 8, 2, 5]`. The `0` and `1` are now sorted.

**Round 3:**

- Scan the unsorted part `[8, 2, 5]`. The smallest number is **2**.
- Swap the `2` with the `8`.
- Result: `[0, 1, 2, 8, 5]`. The `0`, `1`, and `2` are now sorted.

...and so on, until the list is fully sorted to `[0, 1, 2, 5, 8]`.

## The Python Code

Python

```python
def selection_sort(numbers_list):
    # n holds the total count of numbers
    n = len(numbers_list)

    # The outer loop 'i' moves the boundary between the sorted part on the left
    # and the unsorted part on the right.
    for i in range(n):
        
        # We start by assuming the smallest number is at the beginning of the unsorted section.
        min_position = i 
        
        # The inner loop 'j' scans the rest of the list to find the true minimum.
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # If we find a number that is smaller than our current minimum...
            if numbers_list[j] < numbers_list[min_position]:
                # ...we update our record of where the minimum is.
                min_position = j
                
        # After the inner loop, we do ONE swap to move the smallest number
        # to the beginning of the unsorted section.
        numbers_list[i], numbers_list[min_position] = numbers_list[min_position], numbers_list[i]
        
    return numbers_list

# --- How to use it ---
my_numbers = [8, 2, 0, 1, 5]
sorted_numbers = selection_sort(my_numbers)
print(f"The sorted list is: {sorted_numbers}")
```

## Big O Rating

Like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort has a "slowness rating" of **O(n²)** (Very, VERY Slow). This is because it also uses a loop inside another loop to do its work.
