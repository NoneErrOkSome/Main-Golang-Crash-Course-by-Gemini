That is an excellent clarifying question.

The answer is: **No, an independent clause does not _only_ have a subject and a verb.**

While a subject and a verb are the two **essential** components, an independent clause **can** absolutely have an object and other elements.1 The key is whether the verb used requires an object to complete the thought.

This distinction depends on the type of verb in the clause:

### 1. Independent Clauses WITHOUT an Object

This is possible when the clause uses an **intransitive verb**. An intransitive verb expresses a complete action without needing to transfer that action to an object.2

- **Formula:** Subject + Intransitive Verb
- **Examples:**
    - _The sun set._ (Subject: _sun_, Verb: _set_.3 The thought is complete.)
        
    - _Birds fly._ (Subject: _Birds_, Verb: _fly_.4 The thought is complete.)
        
    - _The audience applauded._ (Subject: _audience_, Verb: _applauded_. The thought is complete.)

In these examples, nothing is receiving the action. The verb itself is enough to make the clause a complete idea.

### 2. Independent Clauses WITH an Object

This is necessary when the clause uses a **transitive verb**. A transitive verb requires a direct object to receive the action and make the thought complete.5

- **Formula:** Subject + Transitive Verb + Object
- **Examples:**
    - _The chef prepared a meal._ (Subject: _chef_, Verb: _prepared_, Object: _a meal_.6 Without "a meal," the thought "The chef prepared" is incomplete.)
        
    - _She wrote a letter._ (Subject: _She_, Verb: _wrote_, Object: _a letter_.)7
        
    - _The company manufactures electronics._ (Subject: _company_, Verb: _manufactures_, Object: _electronics_.)

### Summary

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Type of Clause**|**Must have a Subject?**|**Must have a Verb?**|**Has an Object?**|**Stands Alone?**|
|Independent (with intransitive verb)|**Yes**|**Yes**|**No**|**Yes**|
|Independent (with transitive verb)|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|

So, the rule is not about the _absence_ of an object. The rule is that an independent clause **must have a subject and a verb, and together they must express a complete thought.**8 Sometimes that complete thought requires an object, and sometimes it doesn't.
