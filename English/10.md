Of course. "FANBOYS" is a handy acronym that helps you remember the seven **coordinating conjunctions** in English. These words are essential for connecting ideas and creating more complex, flowing sentences.

The acronym FANBOYS stands for:

- **F**or
- **A**nd
- **N**or
- **B**ut
- **O**r
- **Y**et
- **S**o

Coordinating conjunctions have one main job: to join grammatically equal parts of a sentence.1 This could be two words, two phrases, or two complete sentences (independent clauses).

### The Main Rules for Using FANBOYS

There are two primary ways you'll use these conjunctions, each with a different punctuation rule.

#### Rule 1: Joining Two Independent Clauses (Complete Sentences)

This is the most important rule. When you use a FANBOYS conjunction to connect two complete sentences, you **must place a comma before the conjunction**.

A sentence that connects two independent clauses this way is called a **compound sentence**.

**Formula:** [Complete Sentence] , + [FANBOYS Conjunction] + [Complete Sentence].

- **Example:** The sun was shining brightly, **but** a cold wind was blowing.
    
    - "The sun was shining brightly" is a complete sentence.
    - "A cold wind was blowing" is also a complete sentence.
    - The comma and the conjunction "but" join them together.
- **Incorrect (Comma Splice):** The sun was shining brightly, a cold wind was blowing.
    
- **Incorrect (Run-on Sentence):** The sun was shining brightly but a cold wind was blowing.
    

#### Rule 2: Joining Words or Phrases

When you use a FANBOYS conjunction to connect two words or two phrases (which are not complete sentences), you **do not use a comma**.

- **Connecting two words:** Would you like a pen **or** a pencil?
- **Connecting two phrases:** He walked down the street **and** around the corner.

Now, let's look at what each of the FANBOYS does.

### A Guide to Each of the FANBOYS

#### **F**or (Shows a Reason)

This is a more formal way of saying "because." It introduces the cause or reason for the preceding clause.

- I am not going out tonight, **for** I have to study for a big exam.
- She was praised by her boss, **for** her project was a huge success.

#### **A**nd (Adds Information)

This is the most common conjunction. It simply adds one thing to another.

- He cooked dinner, **and** she washed the dishes.
- Bangkok is known for its vibrant street life **and** delicious food.2
    

#### **N**or (Adds a Negative Idea)

This is used to continue a negative thought. It's the negative version of "or." Note that the word order after "nor" is inverted (verb before the subject).

- He doesn't enjoy spicy food, **nor** does he like sweet desserts.
- She will not be attending the meeting, **nor** will she send a representative.

#### **B**ut (Shows Contrast)

This is used to connect two ideas that are in contrast or opposition to each other.

- I want to go to the beach, **but** it's raining.
- He is a fantastic musician, **but** he has terrible stage fright.

#### **O**r (Shows a Choice)

This presents an alternative or a choice between two things.

- We can go to the movies tonight, **or** we can stay home and watch Netflix.
- You must finish your homework, **or** you will not be able to go out.

#### **Y**et (Shows Contrast, often with a surprise)

"Yet" is very similar to "but." It shows a contrast that is often surprising or unexpected in light of the first clause.

- The movie received terrible reviews, **yet** it was a huge box office success.
- He knows the risks, **yet** he is determined to proceed.

#### **S**o (Shows a Result)

This conjunction shows that the second clause is the result, effect, or consequence of the first clause.

- It was past midnight, **so** I decided to go to bed.
- The traffic was heavy, **so** we were late for our appointment.
