Of course. "A WHITE BUS" is a popular and very useful mnemonic device to help you remember some of the most common **subordinating conjunctions**.

Let's break down what that means first, and then go through the acronym letter by letter.

### What is a Subordinating Conjunction?

A subordinating conjunction is a word that connects two clauses: an independent clause (a complete thought) and a dependent clause (an incomplete thought).

Its job is to show the relationship between these two clausesâ€”such as time, cause, condition, or contrast. Crucially, the subordinating conjunction is what makes a clause **dependent**.

**The Main Punctuation Rule:** When a dependent clause starts the sentence, it must be followed by a comma. If the independent clause comes first, you usually don't need a comma.

- **Correct:** **Because it was hot,** we went swimming.
- **Correct:** We went swimming **because it was hot.**

Now, let's explore the "A WHITE BUS" mnemonic.

### A WHITE BUS: Explained

#### **A** - After, Although, As

- **After** (Time): Shows that one event happened later than another.
    
    > "**After** the movie ended, we went out for dinner."
    
- **Although** (Contrast): Presents a contrast or concession, similar to "but."
    
    > "**Although** he was exhausted, he finished the race."
    
- **As** (Reason or Time): Can mean "because" or "while."
    
    > "As it was getting dark, we decided to head home." (Reason)
    > 
    > "He arrived as I was leaving." (Time)
    

#### **WH** - When, Whenever, Whereas, While, Where

- **When / Whenever** (Time): "When" refers to a specific time. "Whenever" means "every time."
    
    > "I will call you when I arrive."
    > 
    > "Whenever it rains, the streets in my neighborhood flood."
    
- **Whereas** (Contrast): Used to make a direct comparison or show a sharp contrast between two ideas. It is often used in formal or academic writing.
    
    > "My brother loves spicy food, **whereas** I prefer milder dishes."
    
- **While** (Time or Contrast): Can mean "at the same time" or can be used like "although."
    
    > "She read a book while she waited for the bus." (Time)
    > 
    > "While I understand your point, I don't agree with it." (Contrast)
    
- **Where** (Place): Refers to a location.
    
    > "This is the park **where** we first met."
    

#### **I** - If, In case

- **If** (Condition): Introduces a conditional clause.
    
    > "**If** you finish your work early, you can leave."
    
- **In case** (Precaution): Explains the reason for a precaution.
    
    > "You should bring an umbrella in case it rains."
    > 
    > (The difference: You bring the umbrella as a precaution, whether it rains or not. With "if," the action depends on the condition being met.)
    

#### **T** - Though

- **Though** (Contrast): A synonym for "although." It's very flexible and can be used in different parts of a sentence.
    
    > "**Though** the test was difficult, she passed easily."
    

#### **E** - Even though, Even if

- **Even though** (Strong Contrast): A more emphatic or stronger version of "although."
    
    > "**Even though** he had a map, he still got lost."
    
- **Even if** (Hypothetical Condition): Introduces a condition that may or may not be real, but the result will remain the same.
    
    > "I will support my team, **even if** they lose every game."
    

#### **B** - Because, Before

- **Because** (Reason): The most direct way to state a cause or reason.
    
    > "He was late **because** the traffic was terrible."
    
- **Before** (Time): Shows that one event happened earlier than another.
    
    > "You should always brush your teeth **before** you go to bed."
    

#### **U** - Until, Unless

- **Until** (Time): Specifies the duration of an action up to a certain point.
    
    > "We waited **until** the rain stopped."
    
- **Unless** (Negative Condition): Means "except if."
    
    > "You won't understand the story **unless** you've read the book."
    

#### **S** - Since, So that

- **Since** (Time or Reason): Can refer to time (from a past point until now) or mean "because."
    
    > "I have been much happier since I moved to Bangkok." (Time)
    > 
    > "Since we have some time to spare, let's get some coffee." (Reason)
    
- **So that** (Purpose): Explains the purpose of an action. Don't confuse it with the FANBOYS conjunction "so" (which shows a result).
    
    > "He saved his money **so that** he could buy a new phone." (This was his purpose for saving.)
