Yes, absolutely. A dependent clause can and very often does come before an independent clause.

This is a common and effective way to structure a sentence in English. When you place the dependent clause at the beginning of the sentence, you create what is called an introductory clause.

### The Rule for Punctuation

The most important rule to remember for this structure is about punctuation:

**When a dependent clause comes before an independent clause, you must separate them with a comma.**

**Formula:** Dependent Clause + , + Independent Clause.

### Examples

Let's look at how this works. Notice the comma after the introductory dependent clause in each example.

- **Dependent clause first:** **Because he was tired,** he went to bed early.
    
    - (The dependent clause "Because he was tired" sets up the reason for the main action.)
- **Dependent clause first:** **If you finish your homework,** you can play video games.
    
    - (The dependent clause "If you finish your homework" presents a condition.)
- **Dependent clause first:** **After the storm passed,** a rainbow appeared in the sky.
    
    - (The dependent clause "After the storm passed" establishes the time.)

### Comparing the Two Structures

You can often say the same thing by putting the independent clause first. The main difference is the flow of the sentence and the punctuation. **When the independent clause comes first, you usually do not need a comma.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Dependent Clause First (Comma Needed)**|**Independent Clause First (No Comma Needed)**|
|**Although she was nervous,** she gave a great speech.|She gave a great speech **although she was nervous.**|
|**When the bell rings,** the students leave the classroom.|The students leave the classroom **when the bell rings.**|
|**Since you're already here,** you might as well help.|You might as well help **since you're already here.**|

Placing the dependent clause first is a great way to add variety to your writing and to emphasize the reason, time, or condition before stating the main point. Just remember to use that all-important comma.
