The word "as" is one of the most versatile words in the English language, serving multiple grammatical functions.1 Understanding its different uses can significantly improve your writing and comprehension. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to use "as" in its main roles: as a conjunction and as a preposition.

### 1. Using "As" as a Conjunction

When "as" is used as a conjunction, it connects two clauses.2 It has three primary meanings in this role.

#### a) To Mean "Because" or "Since" (To Give a Reason)

In this context, "as" introduces the reason for the main clause.3

- **As** it was getting late, we decided to go home.4 (Meaning: _Because_ it was getting late, we decided to go home.)5
    
- I didn't go to the party, **as** I had a prior commitment.
- He may need some help, **as** he is new to the project.

#### b) To Mean "While" or "At the Same Time As" (To Show Simultaneous Action)

Here, "as" links two actions that are happening at the same time.

- **As** the sun set, the city lights began to twinkle.
- He tripped **as** he was running for the bus.

#### c) To Make Comparisons (In the "as...as" structure)

This is one of the most common uses. The structure `as + adjective/adverb + as` is used to show that two things are equal in some way.7

- The water was **as cold as** ice. (Comparing adjectives)
- He can run **as fast as** his brother. (Comparing adverbs)

When used as a preposition, "as" describes the function, role, or appearance of someone or something.8
