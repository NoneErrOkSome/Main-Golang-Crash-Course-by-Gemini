Of course. Here is a condensed version of that excellent explanation, formatted as a clear and concise note for you to keep.

### **Note: Subordinate Conjunctions vs. Subordinate Clauses**

#### **1. Key Concept:**

They are not the same but are directly related. A **conjunction** is the single word that _creates_ the entire **clause**.

#### **2. The "Train" Analogy:**

- **Independent Clause (The Engine):** A complete thought that can stand alone.
    - _e.g., "We cancelled the picnic."_
- **Subordinate Conjunction (The Hook):** A single word that connects the clauses.
    - _e.g., `because`_
- **Subordinate Clause (The Train Car):** An incomplete thought that is "pulled" by the main clause. It cannot stand alone.
    - _e.g., `because it was raining`_

#### **3. Definitions:**

- **Subordinate Conjunction:**
    
    - **What it is:** A single word or phrase (like _if, when, because, although_).
    - **Its Job:** To introduce a dependent clause and show its relationship (time, cause, condition) to the main clause.
- **Subordinate Clause (or Dependent Clause):**
    
    - **What it is:** A group of words with a subject and a verb.
    - **Its Structure:** It _begins_ with a subordinate conjunction.
    - **Its Weakness:** It cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.

#### **4. How They Work Together (Example):**

**Sentence:** "She was happy **although the traffic was heavy**."

- **Independent Clause:** `She was happy`
- **Subordinate Conjunction:** `although`
- **Subordinate Clause:** `although the traffic was heavy`

**In Short:** The **conjunction** is the hook; the **clause** is the entire train car it's attached to. You can't have the latter without the former.
