Of course. Here is a dedicated answer explaining the concept of a **Return Value** as a fundamental aspect of functions in Go.

### **Return Value in Go: A Function's Output**

In the world of programming, a function is often asked to perform a task and then report back with a result. A **return value** is the mechanism by which a function sends data _back_ to the code that called it. It's the "output" in the fundamental "input-process-output" model of a function.

If parameters are the ingredients you give to a chef (the function), the return value is the finished dish they hand back to you. In Go, the concept of a return value is made exceptionally powerful and is central to the language's design for writing clear and robust code.

### Declaring Return Values in a Function Signature

You specify the type of value(s) a function will return in its declaration, right after the parameter list.

**Syntax for a Single Return Value:**

Go

```Go
// This function is declared to return a single 'string' value.
func getGreeting(name string) string {
    // The 'return' keyword sends the value back.
    return "Hello, " + name
}
```

### The `return` Statement

Inside a function, the `return` statement performs two actions:

1. It immediately stops the execution of the current function.
    
2. It passes the specified value(s) back to the caller.

### Go's Core Feature: Multiple Return Values

A defining characteristic of Go is its ability for functions to return **multiple values**. This is a significant departure from many other languages where you might be limited to a single return value. This feature is not just for convenience; it is the cornerstone of Go's idiomatic error handling.

#### The Idiomatic `(result, error)` Pattern

The most common use of multiple return values in Go is the `(result, error)` pattern. A function is designed to return both the intended result and an `error` value.

- On success, it returns the result and a `nil` error. (`nil` is Go's equivalent of `null`, meaning "no error occurred").
    
- On failure, it returns a zero value for the result (e.g., `0`, `""`, or `nil`) and a descriptive `error` object.
    

This forces the programmer who calls the function to explicitly check for and handle potential failures.

**Example: A Safe Division Function**

Go

```Go
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)

// This function declares two return types: a float64 and an error.
func safeDivide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        // On failure, return a zero value for the float and a new error.
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero is not allowed")
    }

    // On success, return the result and 'nil' for the error.
    return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
    // --- Calling the function and checking the return values ---
    result, err := safeDivide(10.0, 2.0)

    // The idiomatic 'if err != nil' check.
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("An error occurred:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Success! The result is:", result)
    }

    // --- Now, let's trigger the error ---
    result2, err2 := safeDivide(5.0, 0)
    if err2 != nil {
        fmt.Println("An error occurred:", err2)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Success! The result is:", result2)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```Go
Success! The result is: 5
An error occurred: division by zero is not allowed
```

### Named Return Values

Go also allows you to name the return values in the function signature. This has two main effects:

1. The named return values are declared as variables within the function, initialized to their zero values.
    
2. It allows for a "bare" `return` statement, which will automatically return the current values of the named variables.
    

This can sometimes improve readability by making the purpose of each return value explicit.

**Example with Named Returns:**

Go

```Go
// The return values 'quotient' and 'err' are named.
func safeDivideNamed(a, b float64) (quotient float64, err error) {
    if b == 0 {
        // Assign values to the named return variables.
        quotient = 0
        err = errors.New("division by zero")
        return // Bare return sends back the current values of 'quotient' and 'err'.
    }

    quotient = a / b
    err = nil
    return // Returns the calculated quotient and nil error.
}
```

### Ignoring Return Values with the Blank Identifier (`_`)

Sometimes a function returns multiple values, but you only care about one of them. Go requires you to account for every returned value. To explicitly discard an unwanted value, you use the **blank identifier**, which is an underscore (`_`).

Go

```Go
// We are confident this division will work and choose to ignore the error.
// The '_' tells the compiler we are intentionally discarding the second return value.
result, _ := safeDivide(100.0, 10.0)

fmt.Println("We only cared about the result:", result)
```

In summary, the return value is a fundamental concept that Go elevates into a powerful tool for creating robust, explicit, and readable code, especially through its idiomatic use of multiple returns for error handling.
