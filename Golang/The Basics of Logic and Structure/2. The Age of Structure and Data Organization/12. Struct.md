**Struct / Record:** Replaced with **`struct`**. This is Go's primary tool for creating composite data types by grouping together fields of data.

Of course. Here is a dedicated answer that fully explores the `struct`, Go's primary tool for creating composite data types.

### **The `struct`: Go's Blueprint for Custom Data**

In Go, a **`struct`** (short for structure) is a composite data type that groups together zero or more variables (called **fields**) into a single, logical unit. It is Go's primary tool for modeling real-world entities and creating complex, user-defined data types. If basic types like `int` and `string` are individual bricks, a `struct` is the blueprint you design to build a house out of those bricks.

It replaces the concept of a "Record" from other languages and serves as the foundational data component of Go's approach to object-oriented design.

### Defining a Struct

You define a new `struct` type using the `type` and `struct` keywords. The definition lists the fields that make up the struct, with each field having a name and a type.

A critical concept in Go is that field names starting with a **capital letter** are **exported**, meaning they are public and can be accessed from other packages. Fields starting with a **lowercase letter** are **unexported** and private to the package they are defined in.

**Syntax and Example:**

Go

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a new type 'Employee' which is a struct.
// This is the blueprint.
type Employee struct {
    FirstName string // Exported field
    LastName  string // Exported field
    ID        int    // Exported field
    isManager bool   // Unexported field (only accessible within the 'main' package)
}
```

### Creating and Initializing Instances

Once you have the `struct` blueprint, you can create "instances" of it, which are concrete values that hold the data.

#### 1. Zero Value Initialization

You can declare a variable of a struct type without initializing it. All its fields will be automatically set to their respective **zero values** (`0` for numbers, `""` for strings, `false` for booleans, `nil` for pointers, etc.).

Go

```Go
var e1 Employee
// e1 is now: {FirstName:"", LastName:"", ID:0, isManager:false}
fmt.Println(e1)
```

#### 2. Struct Literal with Field Names (Recommended)

This is the most common, readable, and robust way to initialize a struct. You explicitly name each field you are initializing. The order doesn't matter, and you can omit fields, which will then be set to their zero value.

Go

```Go
e2 := Employee{
    FirstName: "Alice",
    LastName:  "Smith",
    ID:        101,
    isManager: true,
}
```

#### 3. Struct Literal without Field Names (Positional)

You can initialize a struct by providing values in the order the fields are defined. This is concise but brittle—if you reorder the fields in the struct definition, this code will break or cause subtle bugs. It's generally discouraged for structs with more than a few fields.

Go

```Go
e3 := Employee{"Bob", "Jones", 102, false}
```

#### 4. Using the `new` Keyword

The `new` keyword allocates memory for a new instance, sets all fields to their zero values, and returns a **pointer** to it.

Go

```Go
// e4 is of type *Employee (a pointer to an Employee)
e4 := new(Employee)
// To change a value, you would do: e4.ID = 103
```

---

### Accessing and Modifying Fields

You access the fields of a struct instance using dot notation (`.`).

Go

```Go
e2.ID = 205 // Modify a field's value

// Access a field's value
fmt.Printf("%s has ID: %d\n", e2.FirstName, e2.ID) // Prints "Alice has ID: 205"
```

A major convenience feature in Go is that the dot notation works for both struct values and pointers to structs. Go automatically dereferences the pointer for you.

Go

```Go
e4_ptr := new(Employee)

// Go handles the pointer dereferencing automatically.
// You can just write e4_ptr.FirstName
e4_ptr.FirstName = "Charles"

// This is equivalent to the more verbose C-style syntax: (*e4_ptr).FirstName = "Charles"
```

---

### Composition with Struct Embedding

Go favors **composition over inheritance**. The primary way to achieve this is through **struct embedding**. You can "embed" one struct type within another, and its fields and methods are "promoted" to the outer struct, making them directly accessible.

Go

```Go
type ContactInfo struct {
    Email string
    Phone string
}

type Person struct {
    Name        string
    ContactInfo // Embedded struct - no field name given
}

func main() {
    p := Person{
        Name: "Diana",
        ContactInfo: ContactInfo{
            Email: "diana@example.com",
            Phone: "555-1234",
        },
    }

    // The fields of ContactInfo are "promoted" and can be accessed directly on Person.
    fmt.Println(p.Email) // Instead of p.ContactInfo.Email
    fmt.Println(p.Phone) // Instead of p.ContactInfo.Phone
}
```

### Struct Tags

Struct tags are string literals placed after a field's type that provide metadata about the field. This metadata is ignored by Go itself but can be read by other libraries using reflection. The most common use case is for controlling how a struct is encoded or decoded, for example with JSON.

Go

```Go
import "encoding/json"

type Product struct {
    Name      string  `json:"name"`
    ProductID int     `json:"productId"`
    IsOnSale  bool    `json:"isOnSale,omitempty"` // omitempty tag hides the field if it has a zero value
}
```

In conclusion, the `struct` is the cornerstone of data modeling in Go. It's a simple yet powerful tool for grouping data, and through features like embedding and tags, it serves as the foundation for building complex, well-structured, and idiomatic Go applications.
