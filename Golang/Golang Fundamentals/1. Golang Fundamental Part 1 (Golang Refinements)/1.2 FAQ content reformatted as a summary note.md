## Notes on Go: Values, Variables, and Basic Types üìù

This note covers the fundamental concepts of values, variables, and Go's basic data types, along with key rules and best practices for their use.

---

### Understanding Variables in Go

- **Values vs. Variables:** A **value** is a specific piece of data, like the number `42` or the string `"hello"`. A **variable** is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. You use a variable's name to refer to the value it contains.
    
- **Static Typing:** Go is a **statically-typed** language. This means the data type of every variable must be known at compile time. This allows the compiler to catch type-related errors early, improves performance, and makes code clearer by making the intended data type explicit.
    
- **Immutability of Type:** Once a variable is declared with a specific type in Go, that type cannot be changed. If you need to store a value of a different type, you must declare a new variable or perform an explicit type conversion.
    
    Go
    
    ```Go
    var data string = "initial text"
    // data = 123 // This would be a compile-time error
    ```
    
- **Unused Variables:** The Go compiler is strict. If you declare a local variable inside a function and do not use it, your program **will not compile**. This helps keep code clean and prevents bugs from leftover variables.

### Declaring Variables and Constants

- **Choosing `var` vs. `:=`:**
    
    - Use the **`var`** keyword when declaring variables at the package level, or when you want to declare a variable without immediately initializing it (it will receive its zero value).
    - Use the **short assignment statement `:=`** for declaring and initializing variables _inside functions_. It's more concise and idiomatic for local variables.
    
    Go
    
    ```Go
    package main
    
    var packageLevelVar = "must use var" // Package level
    
    func main() {
        // Use var when you need the zero value first
        var count int
        // ... some logic ...
        count = 10
    
        // Use := for concise local declaration and initialization
        message := "Hello, Go!"
    }
    ```
    
- **Constants (`const`):**
    
    - Constants are values that are fixed at compile time and cannot be changed. They are declared with the `const` keyword.
    - Unlike variables, they are not just variables you decide not to change; the compiler enforces their immutability.
    - **Untyped Constants:** Constants in Go can be "untyped." This allows them to have very high precision and to be used more flexibly in different numeric contexts without requiring explicit type conversions.
    
    Go
    
    ```Go
    const Pi = 3.14159 // Untyped constant
    const MaxRetries = 3
    
    func main() {
        var a float64 = Pi // Pi behaves like a float64 here
        var b int = MaxRetries // MaxRetries behaves like an int here
    }
    ```

### Zero Values

If a variable is declared without an initial value, it is automatically initialized to its **zero value**. This ensures that variables always have a predictable default state.

- `0` for numeric types (`int`, `float64`, etc.)
- `false` for `bool`
- `""` (an empty string) for `string`
- `nil` for pointers, slices, maps, channels, functions, and interfaces.

Go

```Go
var i int     // 0
var f float64 // 0.0
var b bool    // false
var s string  // ""
```

---

### Naming and Visibility

Go's visibility rules are based on the case of the first letter of an identifier (variable, function, type, etc.):

- **Exported (Public):** If the name starts with an **uppercase letter**, the identifier is exported and visible from other packages.
- **Unexported (Private):** If the name starts with a **lowercase letter**, the identifier is private and only accessible within its own package.

Go

```Go
package mypackage

var ExportedVar = "Accessible from other packages"
var unexportedVar = "Only accessible within mypackage"
```

---

### Choosing Numeric Types

- **Integers (`int`, `int32`, `int64`):** For general-purpose counting or indexing, use `int`. It is optimized for the target architecture. Use specific sizes like `int32` or `int64` when you need to control the exact size of the data (e.g., for network protocols, binary files, or to ensure consistency across platforms).
- **Floats (`float32`, `float64`):** `float64` is the default and is generally preferred for its higher precision. Use `float32` only if memory conservation is critical and the lower precision is acceptable.

---

### Understanding Strings, Bytes, and Runes

- **String Immutability:** Strings in Go are **immutable**. Once created, their contents cannot be changed. Operations that seem to modify a string actually create a new one. This provides safety and predictability.
    
    Go
    
    ```Go
    s1 := "hello"
    s2 := s1
    s1 = "world" // s1 now points to a new string, s2 is unaffected
    // s2 is still "hello"
    ```
    
- **`byte` vs. `rune`:**
    
    - A string is a sequence of **bytes**.
    - A **`byte`** is an alias for `uint8` and represents a single byte, typically an ASCII character.
    - A **`rune`** is an alias for `int32` and represents a single Unicode code point, which can be any character from any language.
    - When you iterate over a string with a `for...range` loop, you get runes, which is the correct way to handle potentially multi-byte Unicode characters.
    
    Go
    
    ```Go
    str := "Go‚ô•"
    // len(str) would be 4 (bytes: G=1, o=1, ‚ô•=2)
    
    // Ranging over the string correctly gives 3 runes (characters)
    for _, charRune := range str {
        fmt.Printf("%c ", charRune) // G o ‚ô•
    }
    ```
