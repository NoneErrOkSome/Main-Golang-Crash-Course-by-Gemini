## **Summary: Variable and Constant Declaration Rules in Go**

### **1. `var` Declarations**
- Used to declare variables at both package and function level.
- Type can be explicit or inferred from the initializer.
- With type only: variable gets the zero value.
- With type and initializer: variable gets specified value.
- With initializer only: type is inferred.
- Multiple variables can be declared at once (single line or block).

### **2. `const` Declarations**
- Declares compile-time constants that cannot change.
- Can be explicitly typed or untyped (for flexibility, especially with numbers).
- Allowed at both package and function scope.
- Use `iota` for enumerated values or bitmasks.

### **3. Short Assignment (`:=`)**
- Used for concise declaration and initialization inside functions only.
- Always infers the type from the initializer(s).
- Not allowed at package level—function scope only.
- When using multiple assignments with `:=`, at least one variable must be new in that scope.

### **4. Usage Guidelines & Idioms**
- Use `:=` inside functions for local variables when you know their initial value—this is idiomatic Go.
- Use `var`:
  - At package level (required), or when you need zero-value initialization, explicit typing, or a forward declaration without immediate initialization.
- Use `const` for values that must not change during execution (constants, enums, config values). Prefer untyped constants unless a specific type is needed.

### **5. Best Practices**
- Declare variables with minimal necessary scope—keep them as close as possible to where they are used.
- Group related `var` or `const` declarations together in blocks for better clarity (especially at package level).
- The Go compiler enforces usage of all declared local variables; unused locals cause compilation errors and should be removed.

**In summary:**  
Go provides flexible ways to declare variables (`var`, `:=`) and constants (`const`). Choose the appropriate approach based on whether you need mutability, explicit typing, initialization timing, or compile-time guarantees. Adhering to these rules results in clear, idiomatic, maintainable Go code.
