## Logical Operators in Go: Combining Conditions ðŸ§ 

Logical operators in Go are used to combine or modify boolean expressions. They are essential for creating more complex conditions in control flow statements like `if`, `for`, and `switch`. Go supports three primary logical operators: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT).

---

### Boolean Context

Logical operators always work with **boolean** values (`true` or `false`). Expressions involving logical operators will also evaluate to a boolean value. As covered previously, Go requires conditions in control statements to explicitly be boolean; there's no "truthy" or "falsy" concept for non-boolean types in these contexts.

---

### 1. Logical AND (`&&`)

The `&&` operator returns `true` if **both** its left and right operands evaluate to `true`. If either operand (or both) is `false`, the `&&` operator returns `false`.

**Truth Table for `A && B`:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**A**|**B**|**A && B**|
|`true`|`true`|`true`|
|`true`|`false`|`false`|
|`false`|`true`|`false`|
|`false`|`false`|`false`|

Short-Circuit Evaluation:

Go's && operator exhibits short-circuit behavior. This means:

- If the left operand (`A`) evaluates to `false`, the right operand (`B`) is **not evaluated** at all.
- This is because if the first part is `false`, the entire `&&` expression must be `false`, regardless of the second part's value. This can be useful for performance and for preventing errors (e.g., checking for `nil` before attempting to access a field).

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func checkLeftOperand() bool {
	fmt.Println("Left operand (&&) checked")
	return false // Change to true to see right operand evaluated
}

func checkRightOperand() bool {
	fmt.Println("Right operand (&&) checked (this means left was true)")
	return true
}

func main() {
	age := 25
	hasLicense := true
	isExperienced := false

	// Both conditions true
	if (age >= 18) && hasLicense {
		fmt.Println("Allowed to drive.") // This will print
	}

	// One condition false
	if hasLicense && isExperienced {
		fmt.Println("Is licensed and experienced.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Is NOT licensed and experienced (or one of them is false).") // This will print
	}

	fmt.Println("\nShort-circuit demonstration for &&:")
	if checkLeftOperand() && checkRightOperand() {
		fmt.Println("Both operands were true.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("At least one operand was false, or short-circuiting occurred.")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Allowed to drive.
Is NOT licensed and experienced (or one of them is false).

Short-circuit demonstration for &&:
Left operand (&&) checked
At least one operand was false, or short-circuiting occurred.
```

If you change `checkLeftOperand()` to return `true`, you'll see `checkRightOperand()` also gets called.

---

### 2. Logical OR (`||`)

The `||` operator returns `true` if **at least one** of its operands evaluates to `true`. It only returns `false` if both operands are `false`.

Truth Table for A || B:


| A    | B    | A || B |
| :--- | :--- | :---- |
| true | true | true  |
| true | false| true  |
| false| true | true  |
| false| false| false |




Short-Circuit Evaluation:

The || operator also exhibits short-circuit behavior:

- If the left operand (`A`) evaluates to `true`, the right operand (`B`) is **not evaluated**.
- This is because if the first part is `true`, the entire `||` expression must be `true`, regardless of the second part's value.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func hasAdminAccess() bool {
	fmt.Println("Admin access (||) checked")
	return true // Change to false to see editor access evaluated
}

func hasEditorAccess() bool {
	fmt.Println("Editor access (||) checked (this means admin access was false)")
	return true
}

func main() {
	isWeekend := true
	isHoliday := false

	// One condition true
	if isWeekend || isHoliday {
		fmt.Println("It's a day off!") // This will print
	}

	hasEmail := false
	hasPhoneNumber := false
	if hasEmail || hasPhoneNumber {
		fmt.Println("Contact information available.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No contact information found.") // This will print
	}

	fmt.Println("\nShort-circuit demonstration for ||:")
	if hasAdminAccess() || hasEditorAccess() {
		fmt.Println("User has sufficient privileges.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("User does not have sufficient privileges.")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
It's a day off!
No contact information found.

Short-circuit demonstration for ||:
Admin access (||) checked
User has sufficient privileges.
```

If you change `hasAdminAccess()` to return `false`, you'll see `hasEditorAccess()` also gets called.

---

### 3. Logical NOT (`!`)

The `!` operator is a **unary** operator, meaning it acts on a single boolean operand. It inverts the boolean value of its operand.

- If the operand is `true`, `!operand` evaluates to `false`.
- If the operand is `false`, `!operand` evaluates to `true`.

**Truth Table for `!A`:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**A**|**!A**|
|`true`|`false`|
|`false`|`true`|

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	isUserActive := false
	isAdmin := true

	fmt.Printf("isUserActive: %t, !isUserActive: %t\n", isUserActive, !isUserActive)
	fmt.Printf("isAdmin: %t, !isAdmin: %t\n", isAdmin, !isAdmin)

	if !isUserActive {
		fmt.Println("User account is not active. Please activate.") // This will print
	}

	if !(isAdmin && isUserActive) { // !(true && false) => !(false) => true
		fmt.Println("Either not an admin OR user is not active (or both).") // This will print
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
isUserActive: false, !isUserActive: true
isAdmin: true, !isAdmin: false
User account is not active. Please activate.
Either not an admin OR user is not active (or both).
```

### Precedence of Logical Operators

Logical operators have a specific order of precedence among themselves and in relation to other operators (like comparison and arithmetic operators). In Go:

1. **`!` (Logical NOT)** has the highest precedence among logical operators.
2. **`&&` (Logical AND)** has the next highest precedence.
3. **`||` (Logical OR)** has the lowest precedence among logical operators.

Comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`) have higher precedence than `&&` and `||`. Arithmetic operators have higher precedence than comparison operators.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := true
	b := false
	c := true

	// Precedence: ! then && then ||
	// result1 := !b && a || b
	//          (!false) && true || false
	//          true && true || false
	//          true || false
	//          true
	result1 := !b && a || b
	fmt.Printf("!%t && %t || %t  is %t\n", b, a, b, result1) // true

	// Using parentheses to clarify or change order
	// result2 := !(b && (a || b))
	//          !(false && (true || false))
	//          !(false && true)
	//          !(false)
	//          true
	result2 := !(b && (a || b))
	fmt.Printf("!(%t && (%t || %t)) is %t\n", b, a, b, result2) // true

	x := 5
	y := 10
	z := 0
	// (x < y) && (y > z) || (z == 0 && x == 5)
	// (true) && (true) || (true && true)
	// true || true
	// true
	complexCondition := x < y && y > z || z == 0 && x == 5
	fmt.Printf("(%d < %d) && (%d > %d) || (%d == 0 && %d == 5) is %t\n",
		x, y, y, z, z, x, complexCondition) // true

	// Explicit parentheses for clarity
	complexConditionExplicit := ((x < y) && (y > z)) || ((z == 0) && (x == 5))
	fmt.Printf("Explicit: %t\n", complexConditionExplicit) // true
}
```

**Output:**

```go
!false && true || false  is true
!(false && (true || false)) is true
(5 < 10) && (10 > 0) || (0 == 0 && 5 == 5) is true
Explicit: true
```

While Go has clear precedence rules, using parentheses `()` is often recommended in complex boolean expressions to improve readability and ensure the intended logic is clear to anyone reading the code.

### Summary

- Go provides three logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).
- These operators work with `bool` values and produce `bool` results.
- `&&` and `||` exhibit **short-circuit evaluation**, which can affect performance and prevent errors by not evaluating the second operand if the outcome is already determined by the first.
- `!` has the highest precedence, followed by `&&`, then `||`.
- Parentheses `()` can and should be used to control the order of evaluation and to enhance the clarity of complex logical expressions.

Logical operators are fundamental for building decision-making logic within your Go programs, enabling you to control program flow based on multiple conditions.
