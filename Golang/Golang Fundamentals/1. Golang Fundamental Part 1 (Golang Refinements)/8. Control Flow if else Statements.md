## Control Flow in Go: `if/else` Statements ðŸš¦

In programming, **control flow** refers to the order in which the computer executes statements in a script or program. `if/else` statements are fundamental control flow structures that allow your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.

---

### The `if` Statement

The `if` statement is the most basic decision-making structure. It executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
if condition {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

- **`condition`**: This is a boolean expression (an expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`).
- **`{}` (Curly Braces)**: In Go, curly braces are **mandatory** around the block of code to be executed, even if it's just a single line. The opening brace `{` must be on the same line as the `if` keyword.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	age := 20

	if age >= 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult.") // This will be printed
	}

	temperature := 30.5
	if temperature > 25.0 {
		fmt.Println("It's a warm day!") // This will be printed
	}

	isRaining := false
	if isRaining {
		fmt.Println("Don't forget your umbrella!") // This will NOT be printed
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
You are an adult.
It's a warm day!
```

---

### The `if/else` Statement

The `if/else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is `true` and a different block of code if the condition1 is `false`.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
if condition {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	score := 75

	if score >= 60 {
		fmt.Println("Congratulations, you passed!") // This will be printed
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Sorry, you did not pass. Keep trying!")
	}

	number := 7
	if number%2 == 0 {
		fmt.Printf("%d is an even number.\n", number)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%d is an odd number.\n", number) // This will be printed
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Congratulations, you passed!
7 is an odd number.
```

---

### The `if/else if/else` Statement (Chained Conditions)

For situations where you have multiple conditions to check, you can chain `if` statements using `else if`.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
if condition1 {
    // code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if condition2 {
    // code to execute if condition1 is false AND condition2 is true
} else if condition3 {
    // code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false AND condition3 is true
} else {
    // code to execute if ALL preceding conditions are false
}
```

- Go evaluates the conditions from top to bottom.
- As soon as a condition evaluates to `true`, its corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest of the `else if/else` chain is skipped.
- The final `else` block is optional and acts as a "catch-all" if none of the preceding `if` or `else if` conditions are met.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	grade := 88

	if grade >= 90 {
		fmt.Println("Excellent! You got an A.")
	} else if grade >= 80 {
		fmt.Println("Good job! You got a B.") // This will be printed
	} else if grade >= 70 {
		fmt.Println("Fair. You got a C.")
	} else if grade >= 60 {
		fmt.Println("You passed with a D.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Unfortunately, you failed.")
	}

	day := "Sunday"
	if day == "Saturday" {
		fmt.Println("It's Saturday, time to relax!")
	} else if day == "Sunday" {
		fmt.Println("It's Sunday, enjoy your weekend!") // This will be printed
	} else {
		fmt.Println("It's a weekday, back to work/study.")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Good job! You got a B.
It's Sunday, enjoy your weekend!
```

### `if` Statement with a Short Statement

Go allows you to include a short **initialization statement** as part of an `if` (or `else if`) statement. This statement is executed before the condition is evaluated. Variables declared in this short statement are scoped only to the `if` (and any `else if/else` blocks associated with it).

This is often used to declare variables that are only needed for the conditional check, keeping their scope minimal.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
if initializationStatement; condition {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

Code snippet

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func getNumber() int {
	// Seed the random number generator (important for getting different numbers each run)
	// Note: In Go 1.20+, seeding is handled automatically for the global Rand.
	// For older versions, or for reproducible sequences, use rand.NewSource.
	// For this example, we'll just use the global Rand which is often sufficient for simple cases.
	// rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // For older Go versions or specific seed control.
	return rand.Intn(100) // Returns a random integer between 0 and 99
}

func main() {
	// Example 1: Simple check
	if num := getNumber(); num%2 == 0 {
		// 'num' is only available within this if/else block
		fmt.Printf("%d is even.\n", num)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%d is odd.\n", num)
	}
	// fmt.Println(num) // Error: 'num' is undefined here, outside its scope

	// Example 2: Using the initialized variable in multiple branches
	if length := len("Hello Go"); length > 5 {
		fmt.Printf("The string has length %d, which is greater than 5.\n", length)
	} else if length == 5 {
		fmt.Printf("The string has length %d, which is exactly 5.\n", length) // This will be printed
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("The string has length %d, which is less than 5.\n", length)
	}

	// Example with error checking (common pattern in Go)
	value, err := someFunctionThatReturnsValueAndError()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error occurred:", err)
		// Handle error, perhaps return or log
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Success! Value is:", value)
		// Process value
	}
}

// Dummy function for the error checking example
func someFunctionThatReturnsValueAndError() (string, error) {
	// Simulate a successful operation
	return "Processed Data", nil
	// To simulate an error:
	// return "", errors.New("something went wrong")
}
```

**Output (the random number will vary):**

```go
(e.g.) 42 is even.
The string has length 8, which is greater than 5.
Success! Value is: Processed Data
```

_Note: For `getNumber()`, in Go 1.20 and later, the global `rand` package is automatically seeded. In older versions, you'd typically call `rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())` once at the start of your program for non-deterministic random numbers._

The `if` statement with a short statement is a powerful Go idiom for writing concise and scoped conditional logic, especially common when a function returns a value and an error.

### Boolean Conditions

The condition in an `if` statement must always evaluate to a boolean (`true` or `false`). Go does not have the concept of "truthy" or "falsy" values in the same way JavaScript does (where numbers like `0` or non-empty strings can be implicitly treated as booleans). You must use explicit comparisons or boolean variables.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	count := 0
	// if count { // ERROR: non-bool count (type int) used as if condition
	// }

	if count == 0 { // CORRECT: Explicit boolean condition
		fmt.Println("Count is zero.")
	}

	message := "Hello"
	// if message { // ERROR: non-bool message (type string) used as if condition
	// }

	if message != "" { // CORRECT: Explicit boolean condition
		fmt.Println("Message is not empty.")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Count is zero.
Message is not empty.
```

### Summary

- `if` statements execute code based on a boolean condition.
- `else` provides an alternative block of code if the `if` condition is false.
- `else if` allows for chaining multiple conditions.
- Curly braces `{}` are always required for the code blocks.
- Go supports an optional **initialization statement** within `if` conditions, which helps limit the scope of variables.
- Conditions in `if` statements must explicitly evaluate to a `bool` type.

`if/else` statements are fundamental for controlling the execution path of your Go programs, enabling them to respond dynamically to different inputs and states.
