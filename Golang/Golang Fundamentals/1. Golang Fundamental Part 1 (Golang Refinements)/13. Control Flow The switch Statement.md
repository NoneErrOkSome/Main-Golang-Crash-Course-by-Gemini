## Control Flow in Go: The `switch` Statement स्टेटमेंट

The `switch` statement in Go provides a concise way to control program flow by selecting one of several code blocks (cases) to execute based on the value of an expression. It's often a more readable alternative to a long chain of `if/else if/else` statements, especially when dealing with a single value that can have multiple distinct states.

---

### Basic `switch` Statement

In its most basic form, a `switch` statement evaluates an expression and then compares its value against the values specified in various `case` clauses.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
switch expression {
case value1:
    // code to execute if expression == value1
case value2:
    // code to execute if expression == value2
case value3, value4: // Multiple values can share a case
    // code to execute if expression == value3 OR expression == value4
default:
    // code to execute if expression matches none of the above cases
    // The default case is optional.
}
```

**Key Characteristics in Go:**

- **No Automatic Fallthrough:** Unlike C-style languages or JavaScript, Go's `switch` cases do **not** automatically "fall through" to the next case. Once a matching `case` is found and its code block is executed, the `switch` statement terminates. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent common bugs.
- **`break` is Implicit:** You don't need to use a `break` statement at the end of each `case` block as it's implied.
- **`fallthrough` Keyword:** If you explicitly want fallthrough behavior (to execute the next case block regardless of its condition), you can use the `fallthrough` keyword. This is used much less commonly.
- **Strict Comparison:** The comparison between the `expression` and the `case` values is strict (like using `==`). The types must be comparable.
- **`default` Case:** The `default` case is optional. If present, its code block executes if no other `case` matches the expression's value. It can appear anywhere in the `switch` statement, not necessarily at the end, but conventionally it's placed last.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	day := "Wednesday"

	switch day {
	case "Monday":
		fmt.Println("Start of the work week.")
	case "Tuesday":
		fmt.Println("Second day of the work week.")
	case "Wednesday":
		fmt.Println("Mid-week!") // This will execute
	case "Thursday":
		fmt.Println("Almost there.")
	case "Friday":
		fmt.Println("TGIF!")
	case "Saturday", "Sunday": // Multiple values for one case
		fmt.Println("It's the weekend!")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Not a valid day.")
	}

	score := 85
	switch { // Expressionless switch (see next section)
	case score >= 90:
		fmt.Println("Grade: A")
	case score >= 80:
		fmt.Println("Grade: B") // This will execute
	case score >= 70:
		fmt.Println("Grade: C")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Grade: D or F")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Mid-week!
Grade: B
```

### Expressionless `switch` (Boolean `case` Expressions)

Go allows you to write a `switch` statement without an explicit expression after the `switch` keyword. This form is equivalent to `switch true`. In this case, the `case` clauses themselves are boolean expressions, and the first `case` that evaluates to `true` will have its code block executed.

This makes an expressionless `switch` a clean way to write more complex `if/else if/else` logic.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
switch { // equivalent to switch true
case booleanCondition1:
    // code to execute if booleanCondition1 is true
case booleanCondition2:
    // code to execute if booleanCondition1 is false AND booleanCondition2 is true
default:
    // code to execute if all preceding booleanConditions are false
}
```

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	age := 30

	switch { // Equivalent to switch true
	case age < 0:
		fmt.Println("Invalid age.")
	case age < 18:
		fmt.Println("You are a minor.")
	case age >= 18 && age < 65:
		fmt.Println("You are an adult.") // This will execute
	case age >= 65:
		fmt.Println("You are a senior citizen.")
	default: // Not strictly necessary here as all positive ages are covered
		fmt.Println("Age category unknown.")
	}

	number := 0
	switch {
	case number < 0:
		fmt.Println("Number is negative.")
	case number == 0:
		fmt.Println("Number is zero.") // This will execute
	case number > 0:
		fmt.Println("Number is positive.")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
You are an adult.
Number is zero.
```

### `switch` with a Short Statement

Similar to `if` statements, a `switch` statement can include an optional short initialization statement that is executed before the switch expression is evaluated. Variables declared in this short statement are scoped only to the `switch` statement.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```go
switch initializationStatement; expression {
case value1:
    // ...
// ...
}
```

or for an expressionless switch:

Code snippet

```go
switch initializationStatement; { // equivalent to switch initializationStatement; true
case booleanCondition1:
    // ...
// ...
}
```

Code snippet

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	switch today := time.Now().Weekday(); today {
	case time.Saturday, time.Sunday:
		fmt.Printf("It's %s! Enjoy the weekend.\n", today)
	default:
		fmt.Printf("It's %s. Back to work/study.\n", today)
	}
	// fmt.Println(today) // Error: 'today' is undefined here, outside its scope

	// Example with expressionless switch and short statement
	switch num := 7; { // 'num' is scoped to this switch
	case num%2 == 0:
		fmt.Printf("%d is even.\n", num)
	case num%2 != 0:
		fmt.Printf("%d is odd.\n", num)
	}
}
```

**Output (will vary based on the current day):**

```go
(e.g.) It's Wednesday. Back to work/study.
7 is odd.
```

### The `fallthrough` Statement

As mentioned, Go `switch` cases do **not** fall through by default. If you need execution to continue to the next `case` block (regardless of whether the next case's condition matches), you must use the `fallthrough` keyword explicitly.

`fallthrough` must be the last statement in a `case` block. It transfers control to the _first statement_ of the next case clause. It does **not** check the condition of the next case.

**Use `fallthrough` with caution**, as it can make code harder to understand if not used judiciously. It's relatively rare in idiomatic Go.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	value := 2

	fmt.Println("Demonstrating fallthrough:")
	switch value {
	case 1:
		fmt.Println("Case 1 executed.")
		fallthrough // Control flows to case 2
	case 2:
		fmt.Println("Case 2 executed.") // This will execute
		fallthrough // Control flows to case 3
	case 3:
		fmt.Println("Case 3 executed.") // This will also execute due to fallthrough from case 2
	case 4:
		fmt.Println("Case 4 executed.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Default case executed.")
	}

	// Fallthrough does not check the next case's condition
	fmt.Println("\nFallthrough ignores next case condition:")
	name := "Alice"
	switch name {
	case "Alice":
		fmt.Println("Hello Alice!")
		fallthrough // Will fall into "Bob" case even though name is not "Bob"
	case "Bob":
		fmt.Println("This line is also printed due to fallthrough.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Hello stranger!")
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Demonstrating fallthrough:
Case 2 executed.
Case 3 executed.

Fallthrough ignores next case condition:
Hello Alice!
This line is also printed due to fallthrough.
```

### `case` Expressions with Multiple Values

A single `case` can match multiple values by listing them separated by commas.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	month := "April"

	switch month {
	case "December", "January", "February":
		fmt.Printf("%s is in Winter.\n", month)
	case "March", "April", "May":
		fmt.Printf("%s is in Spring.\n", month) // This will execute
	case "June", "July", "August":
		fmt.Printf("%s is in Summer.\n", month)
	case "September", "October", "November":
		fmt.Printf("%s is in Autumn/Fall.\n", month)
	default:
		fmt.Printf("%s is not a valid month.\n", month)
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
April is in Spring.
```

### Summary

- The `switch` statement provides a multi-way branching mechanism.
- Go `switch` cases do **not** fall through by default; `break` is implicit. Use `fallthrough` for explicit fallthrough.
- A `switch` can have an optional expression. If omitted, it behaves like `switch true`, and `case` conditions are boolean expressions.
- An optional short statement can be used for initialization, with variables scoped to the `switch`.
- `case` clauses can list multiple values.
- The `default` clause is optional and executes if no other cases match.

The `switch` statement in Go is a powerful and often cleaner alternative to nested `if/else if` statements, especially when evaluating a single variable against several possible constant values or when structuring a series of boolean conditions.
