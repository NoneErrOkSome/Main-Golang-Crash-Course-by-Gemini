## Custom Types in Go: Structs üèóÔ∏èüß©

In Go, a **struct** (short for structure) is a composite data type that groups together zero or more named values (called **fields**) of arbitrary types. Structs are used to create custom data types that represent complex entities by combining simpler types. They are a fundamental concept for data modeling in Go.

---

### 1. What is a Struct?

- **Composite Type:** A struct allows you to define a new type by bundling together different pieces of information (fields) that belong together.
- **Named Fields:** Each element within a struct is a named field, and each field has its own type.
- **Data Aggregation:** Structs are used to aggregate related data into a single, coherent unit. For example, a `User` struct might have fields for `ID`, `Username`, `Email`, and `IsActive`.
- **Blueprint for Data:** A struct definition is like a blueprint. Once defined, you can create instances (values) of that struct type.

---

### 2. Defining a Struct

You define a new struct type using the `type` keyword followed by the new type's name and the `struct` keyword with its fields enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

**Syntax:**

Code snippet

```
type StructName struct {
    FieldName1 Type1
    FieldName2 Type2
    // ...
    FieldNameN TypeN
}
```

- `StructName`: The name of your custom struct type. By convention, it starts with an uppercase letter if you want it to be exported (visible outside its package).
- `FieldNameX`: The name of a field within the struct. Field names also follow the export rule (uppercase for exported, lowercase for unexported within the package).
- `TypeX`: The data type of `FieldNameX`.

**Example:**

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct type named 'Employee'
type Employee struct {
	ID        int
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Position  string
	Salary    float64
	IsActive  bool
}

// Another struct example
type Point struct {
	X int // Exported field
	Y int // Exported field
	label string // Unexported field, only accessible within this package
}

func main() {
	// We'll create instances (values) of these structs in the next section.
	fmt.Println("Struct types defined.")
}
```

---

### 3. Creating and Initializing Struct Instances

Once a struct type is defined, you can create instances (values) of that type.

#### a. Zero Value Struct

If you declare a variable of a struct type without an explicit initialization, all its fields will be initialized to their respective zero values.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Book struct {
	Title  string
	Author string
	Pages  int
	ISBN   string
}

func main() {
	var b1 Book // All fields are zero-valued
	fmt.Printf("Zero-valued Book (b1): %+v\n", b1)
	// Output: Zero-valued Book (b1): {Title: Author: Pages:0 ISBN:}
}
```

(`%+v` with `Printf` prints struct fields with their names).

#### b. Struct Literals

This is the most common way to create and initialize a struct instance.

- With Field Names (Recommended for Clarity):
    
    You can specify the values for fields by their names. The order of fields doesn't matter, and you can omit fields (they will get their zero value).
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    type Car struct {
    	Make  string
    	Model string
    	Year  int
    	Color string
    }
    
    func main() {
    	car1 := Car{
    		Make:  "Toyota",
    		Model: "Camry",
    		Year:  2023,
    		Color: "Blue", // Trailing comma is required if on new line
    	}
    	fmt.Printf("Car 1: %+v\n", car1)
    
    	// Order doesn't matter, omitted fields get zero value
    	car2 := Car{
    		Model: "Civic",
    		Make:  "Honda",
    		// Year and Color will be 0 and "" respectively
    	}
    	fmt.Printf("Car 2: %+v\n", car2)
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```
    Car 1: {Make:Toyota Model:Camry Year:2023 Color:Blue}
    Car 2: {Make:Honda Model:Civic Year:0 Color:}
    ```
    
- Without Field Names (Order Matters):
    
    You can initialize a struct by providing values for its fields in the order they are defined in the struct type. This is generally discouraged because it's less readable and prone to errors if the struct definition changes. All fields must be provided.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    type Dimensions struct {
    	Width  int
    	Height int
    	Depth  int
    }
    
    func main() {
    	// Less readable, order is crucial
    	dims := Dimensions{10, 20, 5}
    	fmt.Printf("Dimensions: %+v\n", dims)
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```
    Dimensions: {Width:10 Height:20 Depth:5}
    ```
    

#### c. Using the `new()` Built-in Function

The `new(T)` function allocates memory for a value of type `T`, initializes it to its zero value, and returns a **pointer** to it (`*T`).

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Config struct {
	Port    int
	Timeout int
	Host    string
}

func main() {
	// cfgPtr will be of type *Config
	cfgPtr := new(Config) // Allocates memory for Config, all fields zeroed
	fmt.Printf("Config Pointer (cfgPtr) initial: %+v\n", *cfgPtr) // Dereference to see value

	// You can then set the fields using the pointer
	cfgPtr.Port = 8080
	cfgPtr.Host = "localhost"
	fmt.Printf("Config Pointer (cfgPtr) updated: %+v\n", *cfgPtr)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Config Pointer (cfgPtr) initial: {Port:0 Timeout:0 Host:}
Config Pointer (cfgPtr) updated: {Port:8080 Timeout:0 Host:localhost}
```

Often, for structs, it's more common to use a struct literal and take its address if a pointer is needed: `cfgPtr := &Config{Port: 8080}`.

---

### 4. Accessing Struct Fields

You access the fields of a struct instance using the dot `.` operator.

**Syntax:** `structInstance.FieldName`

If you have a pointer to a struct, Go automatically dereferences the pointer when you use the dot operator to access a field (so `structPointer.FieldName` works instead of needing `(*structPointer).FieldName` explicitly, though the latter also works).

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Product struct {
	Name  string
	Price float64
	SKU   string
}

func main() {
	p1 := Product{Name: "Laptop", Price: 1200.50, SKU: "LT-1001"}

	// Accessing fields
	fmt.Println("Product Name:", p1.Name)
	fmt.Println("Product Price:", p1.Price)

	// Modifying fields
	p1.Price = 1150.00
	fmt.Println("Updated Product Price:", p1.Price)

	// Accessing fields via a pointer to a struct
	p2ptr := &Product{Name: "Mouse", Price: 25.00, SKU: "MS-002"}
	fmt.Println("Pointer Product Name:", p2ptr.Name) // Auto-dereferenced
	p2ptr.Price = 22.50
	fmt.Println("Pointer Updated Price:", (*p2ptr).Price) // Explicit dereference also works
}
```

**Output:**

```
Product Name: Laptop
Product Price: 1200.5
Updated Product Price: 1150
Pointer Product Name: Mouse
Pointer Updated Price: 22.5
```

---

### 5. Structs are Value Types

Like arrays, structs in Go are **value types**.

- When a struct instance is assigned to another variable, a **copy** of the entire struct (including all its field values) is made.
- When a struct instance is passed as an argument to a function, a **copy** of the struct is passed.

Modifying the copy does not affect the original struct.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

type User struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

func changeUserName(u User) { // Receives a copy of the User struct
	u.Name = "ChangedInFunc"
	fmt.Printf("Inside changeUserName (copy): %+v\n", u)
}

func changeUserNameByPointer(uPtr *User) { // Receives a pointer to the User struct
	uPtr.Name = "ChangedByPointer"
	fmt.Printf("Inside changeUserNameByPointer (original): %+v\n", *uPtr)
}

func main() {
	user1 := User{ID: 1, Name: "Alice"}
	fmt.Printf("Original user1: %+v\n", user1)

	// Assignment copies the struct
	user2 := user1
	user2.Name = "Bob" // Modifies user2, user1 is unaffected
	fmt.Printf("user1 after assigning to user2 and modifying user2: %+v\n", user1)
	fmt.Printf("user2: %+v\n", user2)

	// Passing struct by value to a function
	changeUserName(user1)
	fmt.Printf("user1 after changeUserName (by value): %+v\n", user1) // Unchanged

	// Passing struct by pointer to a function
	changeUserNameByPointer(&user1)
	fmt.Printf("user1 after changeUserNameByPointer: %+v\n", user1) // Changed
}
```

**Output:**

```
Original user1: {ID:1 Name:Alice}
user1 after assigning to user2 and modifying user2: {ID:1 Name:Alice}
user2: {ID:1 Name:Bob}
Inside changeUserName (copy): {ID:1 Name:ChangedInFunc}
user1 after changeUserName (by value): {ID:1 Name:Alice}
Inside changeUserNameByPointer (original): {ID:1 Name:ChangedByPointer}
user1 after changeUserNameByPointer: {ID:1 Name:ChangedByPointer}
```

If you need a function to modify the original struct, pass a pointer to the struct (`*StructName`). This is also more efficient for large structs as it avoids copying the entire struct.

---

### 6. Comparing Structs

Structs are comparable using `==` and `!=` if **all their field types are comparable**. Two struct values are equal if their corresponding non-blank (exported and unexported) fields are equal.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Coordinate struct {
	X, Y int
}

type Item struct {
    Name string
    Tags []string // Slices are not comparable, so Item struct is not comparable
}

func main() {
	c1 := Coordinate{X: 10, Y: 20}
	c2 := Coordinate{X: 10, Y: 20}
	c3 := Coordinate{X: 1, Y: 2}

	fmt.Println("c1 == c2:", c1 == c2) // true
	fmt.Println("c1 == c3:", c1 == c3) // false
	fmt.Println("c1 != c3:", c1 != c3) // true

	// item1 := Item{Name: "Book", Tags: []string{"fiction"}}
	// item2 := Item{Name: "Book", Tags: []string{"fiction"}}
	// fmt.Println(item1 == item2) // COMPILE ERROR: invalid operation: item1 == item2 (struct containing []string cannot be compared)
}
```

**Output:**

```
c1 == c2: true
c1 == c3: false
c1 != c3: true
```

---

### 7. Anonymous Structs

You can define a struct type inline without giving it an explicit name. This is called an anonymous struct. They are useful for one-off data structures, especially for JSON marshalling/unmarshalling or when a named type is overkill.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Instance of an anonymous struct
	point := struct {
		X     int
		Y     int
		Label string
	}{
		X:     100,
		Y:     200,
		Label: "Center",
	}

	fmt.Printf("Anonymous struct point: %+v\n", point)
	fmt.Println("Point Label:", point.Label)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Anonymous struct point: {X:100 Y:200 Label:Center}
Point Label: Center
```

---

### 8. Embedded Structs (Composition)

Go supports embedding one struct type within another to achieve composition (Go does not have inheritance in the classical OOP sense). The fields and methods of the embedded struct are "promoted" to the outer struct.

Code snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Address struct {
	Street string
	City   string
	Zip    string
}

type Contact struct {
	Address // Embedded struct (anonymous field of type Address)
	Phone   string
	Email   string
}

func main() {
	contact := Contact{
		Address: Address{ // Initialize the embedded Address struct
			Street: "123 Main St",
			City:   "Anytown",
			Zip:    "12345",
		},
		Phone: "555-1234",
		Email: "info@example.com",
	}

	// Fields of the embedded Address struct are promoted
	fmt.Println("Street:", contact.Street) // Accesses contact.Address.Street
	fmt.Println("City:", contact.City)
	fmt.Println("Phone:", contact.Phone)

	// You can also access the embedded struct explicitly
	fmt.Println("Full Address Struct:", contact.Address)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Street: 123 Main St
City: Anytown
Phone: 555-1234
Full Address Struct: {123 Main St Anytown 12345}
```

---

### Summary

- Structs in Go are used to create **custom composite types** by grouping named fields.
- Fields are accessed using the dot operator (`.`).
- Structs are **value types**; they are copied on assignment and when passed to functions. Pass pointers to structs to modify the original or for efficiency with large structs.
- Structs are comparable if all their fields are comparable.
- **Anonymous structs** can be defined inline for simple, one-off structures.
- **Embedding structs** provides a way to achieve composition, promoting fields and methods of the embedded type.
- Visibility of struct types and their fields follows Go's capitalization rule: uppercase first letter for exported, lowercase for unexported.

Structs are a cornerstone of data modeling in Go, allowing you to create meaningful and well-organized representations of the entities your programs work with.
