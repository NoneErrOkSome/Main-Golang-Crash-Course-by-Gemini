## Principles of Web Development & Backend Architecture: A Structured Lesson Plan üèóÔ∏è

This plan focuses on the _concepts_ rather than specific implementations in Node.js or Golang.

### **Module 1: The Foundation - Understanding the Web & HTTP** üåê

- **Lesson 1.1: The Client-Server Model**
    
    - **Concept**: How the internet fundamentally operates with clients (browsers, mobile apps) requesting resources from servers.
        
    - **Why it's key**: This is the bedrock of all web interactions.
        
- **Lesson 1.2: HTTP - The Language of the Web** üó£Ô∏è
    
    - **Concept**: Deep dive into the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
        
        - Request Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD) and their idempotency/safety.
            
        - HTTP Status Codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) and their meanings.
            
        - HTTP Headers (Content-Type, Authorization, Cache-Control, etc.) and their roles.
            
        - Request/Response Structure (Start line, Headers, Body).
            
    - **Why it's key**: Every backend developer _must_ understand HTTP thoroughly. It dictates how your application communicates.
        
- **Lesson 1.3: URLs and URIs - Addressing Resources** üó∫Ô∏è
    
    - **Concept**: How resources on the web are uniquely identified and located. Structure of a URL (scheme, host, port, path, query parameters, fragment).
        
    - **Why it's key**: Forms the basis of routing and resource identification in your backend.
        
- **Lesson 1.4: DNS (Domain Name System) - The Internet's Phonebook** üìñ
    
    - **Concept**: How human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.google.com`) are translated into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
        
    - **Why it's key**: It's the first step in almost any web interaction, enabling users to find your server without knowing its IP address.
        
- **Lesson 1.5: HTTPS & Secure Communication (TLS/SSL)** üîí
    
    - **Concept**: Understanding the importance of HTTPS. How Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts data between the client and server, ensuring privacy and integrity. Brief overview of certificates.

- **Lesson 1.6: Web Browsers - The Primary Client** üíª
    
    - **Concept**: A brief overview of what a web browser does: rendering HTML/CSS/JavaScript, managing cookies, making HTTP requests, and providing developer tools.
        
    - **Why it's key**: Understanding the primary client helps in designing better backend responses and interactions.
        
- **Lesson 1.7: Cookies & Basic State Management over HTTP** üç™
    
    - **Concept**: Since HTTP is stateless, cookies provide a way to store small pieces of information on the client's browser, allowing servers to remember users or sessions across multiple requests.
        
    - **Why it's key**: Introduces the concept of maintaining state in a stateless environment, crucial for user sessions, preferences, etc.
        
- **Lesson 1.8: Common Data Formats on the Web (Brief Overview)** üìÑ
    
    - **Concept**: A quick look at common formats used for data exchange, beyond just HTML for pages:
        
        - **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: The de facto standard for APIs.
            
        - **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: Still used in some legacy systems and specific domains.
            
        - **Plain Text**.
            
    - **Why it's key**: Backend services will often consume and produce data in these formats.
