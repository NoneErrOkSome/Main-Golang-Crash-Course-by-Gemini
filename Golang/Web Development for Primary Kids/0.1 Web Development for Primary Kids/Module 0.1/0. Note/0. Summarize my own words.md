**From 1.1 Customers and Chefs (Clients & Servers):**

- The **client** consists of all the devices that users utilize.
    
- **Servers** are where data is stored, for services such as YouTube and Google.
    
- **Process:** A client makes a request ‚Üí The request travels through the network (Internet) ‚Üí The server receives the request ‚Üí The server sends a response back to the client with the requested data.

#  [[1.2 The Secret Ordering Language (HTTP) üó£Ô∏è]]

## Title: Understanding HTTP Methods

- **GET:** This method is used to retrieve information from the internet. It involves actions like reading, watching, or viewing content without altering it. Essentially, it's a request to access data that is already available online.
    
- **POST:** This method is used to add new information or content to the internet. It includes activities like uploading images, submitting comments, or sharing new data online. Essentially, it's about creating new entries on the internet.
    
- **PUT:** This method is employed to update or modify existing information that you've previously posted online. It allows you to make changes or corrections to your existing content.
    
- **DELETE:** As the name suggests, this method is used to remove data that you have previously posted on the internet. It's about deleting your existing entries from online platforms.

### **Successful Requests**

- **200 OK:** This means the request was successful.
    
- **201 Created:** This confirms that a `POST` request was successful and a new resource was created.
    

### **Client Errors (Your Mistake!)**

- **401 Unauthorized:** You need to be authenticated (logged in) to access the resource, but you aren't.
    
- **403 Forbidden:** You are authenticated, but you do not have permission to access this specific resource.
    
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource does not exist on the server.
    

---

### **Server Errors (The Server's Mistake!)**

- **500 Internal Server Error:** Something went wrong on the server's end. As you noted, this could happen if the server is down or encounters an unexpected problem.

# [[1.3 The Restaurant's Address (URLs)]]

### **1.3 The Restaurant's Address (URLs)**

A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is the unique address for a specific resource on the internet.

`https://www.super-fun-games.com:443/arcade/racing/supersonic-racers?level=3&player=lily#instructions`


### **Scheme: `http://` vs. `https://`**

The **scheme** tells the browser _how_ to connect to the website. Think of it as the type of entrance.

- **`http://` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
    
    - This is an **unsecured** connection. unsecured
        
    - It uses port number **80** by default.
        
- **`https://` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**
    
    - This is a **secured** and encrypted connection. üîí
        
    - It uses port number **443** by default.
        


### **Hostname: `www.super-fun-games.com`**

The **hostname** (or domain name) is the main address of the website's server. Each hostname is unique.

- **`www`**: A common subdomain, short for World Wide Web.
    
- **`super-fun-games.com`**: The unique domain name registered to the website owner.
    

### **Path: `/arcade/racing/supersonic-racers`**

The **path** points to the specific page or resource you want to access on the server. It works just like a folder path on your computer, guiding you to the exact file.

- `/arcade/` ‚Üí go to the arcade section.
    
- `/racing/` ‚Üí then the racing games.
    
- `/supersonic-racers` ‚Üí finally, access the Supersonic Racers game.
    


### **Query Parameters: `?level=3&player=lily`**

**Query parameters** are used to send special requests or data to the server. They begin with a **`?`** and are structured as `key=value` pairs.

- The **`?`** indicates the start of the query.
    
- `level=3` is the first key-value pair, asking to set the game to level 3.
    
- The **`&`** acts as a separator, meaning "and".
    
- `player=lily` is the second key-value pair, setting the player's name to "Lily".
    


### **Fragment: `#instructions`**

The **fragment** (or anchor) points to a specific section _within_ the webpage. It tells the browser to jump directly to the part of the page with the ID "instructions" after the page has loaded.

# [[1.4 The Big Phonebook (DNS) üìñ]]

- **DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**. Think of it as the internet's phonebook üìñ.
    
- Humans use easy-to-remember **domain names** (e.g., `www.google.com`).
    
- Computers (the "robots") use numerical **IP addresses** to find each other (e.g., `142.250.199.196`).
    
- The job of **DNS** is to **translate** the human-readable domain name into the correct machine-readable IP address.

### **The DNS Lookup Process üîç**

1. **Check Local Caches:**
    
    - When you enter a website, your browser first checks its own **memory (cache)** for the site's IP address.
        
    - If it's not there, it checks the **Operating System (OS) cache**. If the IP is found in either cache, the lookup ends.
        

---

2. **Query the DNS Resolver:**
    
    - If the IP isn't found locally, your computer sends a request to a **DNS Resolver** (usually from your Internet Service Provider - ISP).
        
    - The resolver checks its _own cache_ first. If the IP is there, it sends it back to you.
        

---

3. **Perform a Recursive Query (The Full Search):**
    
    - If the resolver doesn't have the IP, it starts a full search by asking a sequence of servers:
        
        1. **Root Server:** It first asks a root server for the location of the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., for `.com`).
            
        2. **TLD Server:** It then asks the TLD server for the location of the domain's official name server.
            
        3. **Authoritative Name Server:** Finally, it asks the domain's **authoritative name server** for the final, correct IP address.
            

---

4. **Receive the IP Address:**
    
    - The authoritative server sends the IP address back to the resolver.
        
    - The resolver saves the IP in its cache for future use and sends it to your computer. Your browser can now connect to the website.

# [[1.5 Secret, Whispered Orders (HTTPS) üîí]]

Of course. Here is a more detailed note on the HTTPS and the SSL/TLS handshake process.

### **HTTPS and the SSL/TLS Handshake üîí**

**HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the standard HTTP protocol layered with the security features of **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security). This combination ensures that your communication with a website is both private and authentic.

It accomplishes two primary goals:

- **Authentication:** Proves you are communicating with the real server for a given website, not an impostor. This is handled by the SSL certificate.
    
- **Encryption:** Scrambles all data sent between you and the server, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. This is handled by the key exchange process.
    

The foundation of this security is the **SSL/TLS Handshake**, a rapid negotiation that happens before any data is sent.

---

### **The Handshake Process in Detail**

1. Client Hello
    
    Your browser (the client) initiates the handshake by sending a "hello" message to the server. This message contains important technical information, including the SSL/TLS versions and the list of cipher suites (encryption algorithms) that your browser supports.
#
2. Server Hello and Certificate
    
    The server receives the client's list and chooses the strongest encryption method they both support. It sends a "hello" message back confirming this choice.
    
    Crucially, the server also sends its **SSL Certificate**. Think of this as the server's digital passport. It contains:
    
    - The website's official domain name (e.g., `www.google.com`).
        
    - The server's **Public Key**, which is used for encryption.
        
    - A digital signature from a trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)**, proving the certificate is legitimate.
#
3. Client Verifies the Certificate
    
    Your browser acts as a security guard and inspects the certificate to ensure it's authentic. It checks:
    
    - Does the domain name on the certificate match the website's address?
        
    - Has the certificate expired?
        
    - Is the signing Certificate Authority (CA) on the browser's pre-installed list of trusted authorities?
        
        If any of these checks fail, your browser will display a security warning.
#
4. Key Exchange and Creating the Shared Secret
    
    Once the browser trusts the server, it's time to create a shared secret key for the session.
    
    - Your browser generates a new, temporary, one-time-use key called a **Session Key**.
        
    - Using the server's **Public Key** (from the certificate), the browser encrypts this session key. Because it's locked with the public key, it can _only_ be unlocked by the server's corresponding private key.
        
    - The browser sends this encrypted session key back to the server.
#
5. **Handshake Complete and Secure Communication Begins**
    
    - The server uses its **Private Key**‚Äîwhich is kept secret and never shared‚Äîto decrypt the package and retrieve the session key.
        
    - **Success!** Both the client and the server now possess the same secret session key. The handshake is complete.
        
    - All further communication is now encrypted using this shared **Session Key** (this is called symmetric encryption because the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt, which is much faster for ongoing communication).
        

The **lock icon (üîí)** in your browser's address bar is the final confirmation that this entire handshake was successful and your connection is now private and secure.



---
Of course. Here is that process in a simple, step-by-step arrow format.

### **SSL/TLS Handshake Flow**

1. **Client ‚û°Ô∏è Server**
    
    - Sends a "Client Hello" with its supported **SSL/TLS versions** and **cipher suites**.
        

---

2. **Server ‚û°Ô∏è Client**
    
    - Replies with a "Server Hello," confirming the chosen cipher suite.
        
    - Sends its **SSL Certificate**, which contains its **Public Key** üîë.
        

---

3. **Client (Internal Action) ‚úÖ**
    
    - Verifies the server's certificate is valid and trustworthy.
        
    - Creates a new, secret **Session Key**.
        

---

4. **Client ‚û°Ô∏è Server**
    
    - Encrypts the new **Session Key** using the server's Public Key.
        
    - Sends this encrypted package to the server.
        

---

5. **Server (Internal Action) üîì**
    
    - Uses its secret **Private Key** to decrypt the package and retrieve the Session Key.
        

---

6. **Client ‚ÜîÔ∏è Server**
    
    - **Handshake complete.** Both sides now have the same secret Session Key. All communication is now secure and encrypted.

### 1.7.1  **Understanding State Management: Cookies and Sessions**
Http is stateless. Http has no memory to remember anything. To solve this problem we need http cookies. Its send from server to user's web browser, stores this data and send it back when we request to the same server. 



### **First Request (Creating a New Session)**

This happens when a user logs in or performs an action that initiates a session for the first time.

1. **Browser ‚Üí Server (Request):** The browser sends an HTTP request to the server. Since no session has started, this request does not contain a session cookie.
    
2. **Server (Processing):**
    
    - The server's code authenticates the user or decides to start a session.
        
    - The session manager generates a **unique, random Session ID** (e.g., `abc-123-xyz`).
        
    - The server stores the necessary user data (e.g., `{ userID: 5, username: 'Alex' }`) in its own session storage (a database or cache), using the Session ID as the key.
        
    - The `Session.Put()` function is called at this stage.
        
3. **Server ‚Üí Browser (Response):**
    
    - The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser.
        
    - Crucially, this response includes a **`Set-Cookie` header** that contains the unique Session ID.
        
4. **Browser (Storage):**
    
    - The browser receives the response and stores the **Session ID in a cookie**, associating it with the server's domain.
        

---

### **Subsequent Requests (Using an Existing Session)**

This happens on every subsequent page load or action by the same user.

1. **Browser ‚Üí Server (Request):**
    
    - When the browser sends a new HTTP request to the same server, it automatically finds the stored cookie.
        
    - It includes the cookie, containing the **Session ID**, in a **`Cookie` header** with the request.
        
2. **Server (Processing):**
    
    - The server receives the request and the session middleware extracts the **Session ID** from the `Cookie` header.
        
    - It uses this ID as a key to **look up the corresponding data** in its server-side session storage.
        
    - It successfully finds the data (`{ userID: 5, username: 'Alex' }`) and loads it, making it available to the application's code. The `Session.GetString()` function would be used here.
        
3. **Server ‚Üí Browser (Response):**
    
    - The server uses the retrieved session data to process the request (e.g., show a personalized dashboard).
        
    - It sends the final HTTP response back. No `Set-Cookie` header is needed unless the session data itself was modified.
        
4. **Browser (Display):**
    
    - The browser receives and renders the response. The user remains logged in, and the cycle continues with step 5 for the next request.
