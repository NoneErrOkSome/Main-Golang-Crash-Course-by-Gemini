Yes, absolutely. That is an **excellent** idea. Starting with the conceptual topics you've outlined in `0.1. List of contents.md` is a perfect way to build the foundation you felt you were lacking.

Think of it like this:

- The **"Web Development for Primary Kids"** guide is the **map of the city**. It shows you what a "restaurant" (server) is, what a "kitchen" (database) is, and how the "roads" (internet) connect everything. It teaches you the **"What & Why."**
- The **"Golang Crash Course"** is the **driving lesson**. It teaches you the specific skills needed to drive the carâ€”how to use the steering wheel (`if/else` statements), the accelerator (`for` loops), and read the road signs (Go syntax). It teaches you the **"How."**

You were feeling lost because you were learning how to drive without having a map of the city. You knew how to turn left and right, but you didn't know where you were going or why.

### A Recommended Learning Path

Here is how you can effectively combine both sets of your learning materials:

1. Step 1: Start with the Concept (The Map)
    
    Before you even look at the Go code for a web server, read through Modules 1, 2, and 5 from your "magical restaurant" guide (0.1. List of contents.md).
    
    - **Module 1** will teach you what Clients, Servers, and HTTP are conceptually.
    - **Module 2** will teach you what "Routing" and "Handlers" are.
    - **Module 5** will teach you what "Middleware" is.
2. Step 2: Connect the Concept to the Code (The Driving Lesson)
    
    Now that you have the mental model, open your Go project and look for the implementation of these concepts. Your questions will be much more targeted.
    
    - **After reading Module 2 about Handlers (the "expert chefs"):**
        
        - **Your thought process:** "Okay, a handler is a specialist chef who makes one type of food. Where are my 'chefs' in the code?"
        - **Where to look:** You would look in `pkg/handlers/handlers.go` and see the `Home` and `About` functions. The code will immediately make more sense because you know its _purpose_.
    - **After reading Module 5 about Middleware (the "door helper"):**
        
        - **Your thought process:** "Okay, middleware is a helper that does a job on every single request before it gets to the chef. Where are my 'helpers' in the code?"
        - **Where to look:** You would look at `middleware.go` and `routes.go`. When you see `mux.Use(NoSurf)`, you'll know, "Ah, this is where I'm telling the `NoSurf` helper to check every customer who comes through the door."

### Your New Learning Loop

For every new topic, follow this pattern:

1. **Read the concept** from your "magical restaurant" guide first.
2. **Ask yourself:** In simple terms, what is the job of this component? (e.g., "The database is the restaurant's recipe book").
3. **Find the corresponding Go code** in your project.
4. **Ask yourself:** How does this specific Go code accomplish the job of being a "recipe book"?

By starting with your high-level conceptual guide, you are giving yourself the "map" you need to understand where each piece of Go code fits into the bigger picture. This is a very effective way to learn and will help you bridge that gap between concept and code.
