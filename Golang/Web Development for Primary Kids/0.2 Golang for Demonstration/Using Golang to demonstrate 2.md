Excellent question! Using Golang is a perfect way to demonstrate these backend concepts because it's designed for building efficient and concurrent network services.

Based on your lesson plan, here is a breakdown of the modules and lessons where I can provide practical, runnable Golang code examples to bring the concepts to life.

---

### Highly Demonstrable with Golang Code âœ…

These are lessons where the concept maps directly to a clear and practical code example.

**Module 1: The Foundation - Understanding the Web & HTTP**

- **Lesson 1.2: HTTP - The Language of the Web:** I can build a simple Go web server that handles different methods (`GET`, `POST`), inspects headers, and sends back different status codes.
- **Lesson 1.3: URLs and URIs:** I can use Go's standard `net/url` package to parse a URL string and show you its different parts (scheme, host, path, query parameters).
- **Lesson 1.4: DNS:** I can use the `net` package to perform a DNS lookup on a domain like `www.google.com` to find its IP addresses.
- **Lesson 1.5: HTTPS & Secure Communication:** I can demonstrate how to start a simple HTTPS server in Go using `http.ListenAndServeTLS`.
- **Lesson 1.7: Cookies & Basic State Management:** I can write a Go handler that sets a cookie on the client's browser and another handler that reads it back on a subsequent visit.
- **Lesson 1.8: Common Data Formats:** I can easily show how to encode Go data structures into JSON or XML (and decode them back) using the `encoding/json` and `encoding/xml` packages.

**Module 2: Backend Application Core - Handling Requests**

- This **entire module** is perfectly suited for Go. I can build a small web application that demonstrates:
    - **Lesson 2.1 & 2.5:** The full request-to-response flow.
    - **Lesson 2.2:** Routing using both the standard library and a popular third-party router like `chi` or `gorilla/mux`.
    - **Lesson 2.3:** Creating different handler functions for each route.
    - **Lesson 2.4:** Parsing data from the URL path, query string, and JSON request body.

**Module 3: Data Management & Persistence**

- **Lesson 3.2: Database Interaction Patterns:** I can use the standard `database/sql` package to connect to a simple database (like SQLite) and perform all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Lesson 3.3: ORMs / ODMs:** I can demonstrate the same CRUD operations but using a popular Go ORM like [GORM](https://gorm.io/) to show the difference in approach.
- **Lesson 3.4: Data Validation:** I can show how to validate incoming data structures using a library like `go-playground/validator`.

**Module 4: Designing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**

- **Lesson 4.2 & 4.3: RESTful API Design & Versioning:** I can build a sample RESTful API for a resource (e.g., "pizzas") that follows REST principles, including using URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/pizzas`).

**Module 5: Middleware & Cross-Cutting Concerns**

- **Lesson 5.1 & 5.2:** This is a key strength of Go's web ecosystem. I can write custom middleware from scratch for logging, checking for an API key, or setting security headers, and show how to chain them together.

**Module 6: Security Fundamentals**

- **Lesson 6.1: Authentication vs. Authorization:** I can demonstrate a simple JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication scheme in a middleware.
- **Lesson 6.3: Secure Data Handling:** I can use Go's `bcrypt` package to show the correct way to hash and verify user passwords.
- **Lesson 6.4 (and 6.2):** I can show how to prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries and how Go's `html/template` package helps prevent XSS attacks.

**Module 7: Concurrency & Asynchronous Operations**

- This is Go's signature feature.
- **Lesson 7.1 & 7.3:** I can create clear examples of launching **goroutines**, communicating between them with **channels**, and coordinating them with a **WaitGroup**. This is where Go truly shines.

**Module 8: Testing & Quality Assurance**

- Go has a fantastic built-in testing framework.
- **Lesson 8.1 & 8.3:** I can write unit tests for individual functions and also demonstrate how to test API endpoints directly using the `net/http/httptest` package, all without needing to run a live server.

**Module 9: Deployment & Operations**

- **Lesson 9.1: Application Configuration:** I can show how to manage configuration using environment variables (using the `os` package) or a config file library.
- **Lesson 9.2: Logging & Monitoring:** I can demonstrate how to implement structured logging using Go's standard `slog` library.
- **Lesson 9.3: Basic Deployment Concepts:** I can provide a sample `Dockerfile` to show how to containerize a Go application for deployment.

**Module 10: Scalability & Performance Considerations**

- **Lesson 10.2: Caching:** I can demonstrate a simple in-memory cache with proper locking (`sync.Mutex`) or show how to connect to an external cache like Redis using a Go client library.

### Conceptual (Supported by Code, but Not Directly Demonstrated)

These lessons are more about principles, but I can write Go code that _follows_ these principles.

- **Lesson 4.1: Principles of API Design:** I can't "demonstrate a principle," but I can write an API that _is_ discoverable, consistent, and predictable, and then explain how the code achieves that.
- **Lesson 10.1 & 10.3: What is Scalability? & Statelessness:** These are architectural principles. I can write a stateless Go application and explain _why_ its design makes it easy to scale horizontally.
