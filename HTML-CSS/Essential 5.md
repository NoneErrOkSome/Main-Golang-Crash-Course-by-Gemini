Yes, the code you provided is an excellent example of a modern, real-world best practice for creating a standard webpage layout. It effectively uses current standards that professional front-end developers employ daily.

Here's a breakdown of _why_ it's considered a best practice:

---

### Semantic HTML

Using tags like **`<header>`**, **`<main>`**, **`<aside>`**, and **`<footer>`** is the correct, modern approach. It gives your page a clear, logical structure that is easily understood by search engines, screen readers for accessibility, and other developers.

### CSS Grid for Page Layout

This is the core of the best practice. **CSS Grid** was specifically designed for creating two-dimensional page layouts like this one.

- **`grid-template-areas`**: This is arguably the most readable and maintainable way to define a layout. You can visually see the structure of your page right in the CSS. Changing the layout is as simple as rearranging the text in this property.
    
- **`fr` Unit**: Using the fractional unit (`1fr`) for the main content area is perfect. It allows that section to be flexible and take up the remaining space, which is essential for a layout that works across different screen sizes.

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

The CSS is structured to be "mobile-first," even though the media query uses `max-width`. A true mobile-first approach would define the single-column layout first, then use a `@media (min-width: 768px)` query to apply the two-column grid for larger screens. However, the provided method is still very common and achieves the same responsive goal:

- **Default State**: A well-defined desktop layout.
    
- **Media Query**: A clear breakpoint (`@media (max-width: 768px)`) that completely and cleanly redefines the grid for smaller screens. This ensures the site is perfectly usable on mobile devices by stacking content vertically.
    

In short, the combination of semantic HTML for structure, CSS Grid for the macro layout, and a media query for responsiveness represents a clean, efficient, and highly maintainable way to build a webpage in 2025. It has replaced older, more complicated methods involving floats or positioning hacks.
