Yes, there is a modern concept of a "universal aggressive default setup" for layout. It's not a single, standardized file like a CSS reset, but rather a collection of powerful, opinionated patterns that you apply globally to make layouts intrinsically responsive and easier to manage.

The philosophy is to make elements flow and arrange themselves intelligently by default, drastically reducing the need to write custom layout code for every component.

## Universal "Aggressive" Layout Styles

This setup uses modern CSS features to automate common layout needs like stacking, centering, and responsive grids.

CSS

```CSS
/* ==========================================================================
   #AGGRESSIVE LAYOUT DEFAULTS
   Opinionated defaults to make layout flow automatically.
   ========================================================================== */

/* --- 1. The Default Stack (for major page sections) --- */
/* Every direct child of `body` will be a block, creating a vertical stack
   with consistent spacing. No more adding margin-bottom to everything. */
body {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2rem; /* The default space between major sections */
}

/* --- 2. The Auto-Responsive Grid Utility --- */
/* Any element with this class becomes a responsive grid container.
   It creates as many columns as will fit and handles stacking automatically. */
.auto-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1.5rem; /* The space between grid items */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
}

/* --- 3. The Centering Utility --- */
/* Any element with this class will center its children both horizontally
   and vertically. The most concise way to center anything. */
.center {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

/* --- 4. The Default Flex Group --- */
/* A simple class for creating horizontal groups of items. */
.flex-group {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allows items to wrap on small screens */
    gap: 1rem;
    align-items: center;
}
```

## Why This is the Professional Approach

### 1. The Default Stack ðŸ¥ž

By applying `display: grid` and `gap` to the `<body>`, you establish an automatic vertical rhythm for your main page sections (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.). They will stack on top of each other with consistent spacing without you needing to add any margins. This simplifies page structure immensely.

### 2. The Auto-Responsive Grid â–¦

This is the most powerful pattern in modern CSS. By creating a single `.auto-grid` utility class, you can create a responsive grid anywhere you need it just by adding the class to a container element. The `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))` line is a "magic" snippet that handles all the responsiveness for you.

### 3. Effortless Centering âœ¨

Centering has historically been a pain point in CSS. The `.center` utility class using `display: grid` and `place-items: center` is the definitive modern solution. It solves vertical and horizontal centering with two lines of code, which you can apply anywhere.

## How to Use It

Your HTML becomes much simpler because the CSS is doing the heavy lifting by default.

HTML

```HTML
<body>
  <header>...</header>

  <main>
    <h2>A collection of items</h2>
    <div class="auto-grid">
      <div>Item 1</div>
      <div>Item 2</div>
      <div>Item 3</div>
      <div>Item 4</div>
    </div>
  </main>

  <aside>
    <div class="center" style="height: 200px; background: #eee;">
      <p>I am centered!</p>
    </div>
  </aside>

  <footer>
    <div class="flex-group">
        <span>Link 1</span>
        <span>Link 2</span>
        <span>Link 3</span>
    </div>
  </footer>
</body>
```
