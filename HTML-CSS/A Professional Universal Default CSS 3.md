Yes, the CSS you provided is an excellent starting point. A more comprehensive "universal" or "opinionated" professional default goes further by resetting more elements, improving accessibility, and setting up a more robust foundation for modern development practices.

Here is a more thorough CSS file that many professionals use as their universal starting point.

## Professional Universal Default CSS

This setup includes more aggressive resets and thoughtful defaults for a wider range of elements, making development smoother.

CSS

```CSS
/* ==========================================================================
   #UNIVERSAL DEFAULT STYLES
   An opinionated and comprehensive CSS setup for modern projects.
   ========================================================================== */

/* --- 1. A More Thorough CSS Reset --- */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0; /* Add padding reset */
}

/* --- 2. Root & Document Level Improvements --- */
html {
  font-size: 100%;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  scroll-padding-top: 2rem; /* Prevent content from being hidden by sticky headers */
}

body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  line-height: 1.6; /* A slightly more generous line-height */
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  text-rendering: optimizeSpeed; /* Prioritize rendering speed */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; /* Improve font rendering on macOS/iOS */
}

/* --- 3. Enhanced Typography & Readability --- */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-wrap: balance;
  line-height: 1.2; /* Tighter line-height for headings */
}

p, li, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  max-width: 65ch; /* Limit line length for all text elements */
  overflow-wrap: break-word; /* Prevent long words from overflowing */
}

/* --- 4. Robust Media & Element Defaults --- */
img,
picture,
video,
canvas,
svg {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: inherit; /* Make links inherit text color by default */
}

ul,
ol {
  list-style: none; /* Remove default list bullets */
}

input,
button,
textarea,
select {
  font: inherit;
  border: none; /* Reset borders on form elements */
  background: transparent; /* Reset backgrounds */
}

button {

}

/* --- 5. Advanced Accessibility & Dark Mode Foundation --- */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid var(--color-primary, #0d6efd);
  outline-offset: 3px;
}

/* Set up dark mode based on user's system preference */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {

    --color-text: #e0e0e0;
    --color-background: #0d1117;
  }

  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border-width: 0;
}
```

## Key Differences from the Previous Standard

This universal default is more "opinionated" because it makes more decisions for you, reflecting common patterns in professional web development.

### More Aggressive Reset

- **`padding: 0;`**: Resets padding on all elements, which is especially useful for lists.
    
- **`list-style: none;`**: Removes bullets from `<ul>` and `<ol>` by default, as they are often styled custom.
    
- **`color: inherit;`**: Makes links inherit their parent's text color. This is a common need, preventing the default blue from appearing in styled components like buttons.
    
- **Form Element Reset**: Removes default borders and backgrounds from form controls, creating a clean slate for custom styling.

### Enhanced Document Behavior

- **`scroll-padding-top`**: A modern accessibility feature that prevents content from being hidden behind a sticky header when a user jumps to an anchor link.
    
- **`text-rendering` & `-webkit-font-smoothing`**: These properties offer finer control over font rendering for a sharper look.
    
- **`overflow-wrap: break-word`**: Prevents long, unbreakable strings (like URLs) from overflowing their container and breaking the layout.
    

---

### Dark Mode Foundation

- **`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`**: This block automatically applies a different set of root variables if the user has dark mode enabled in their operating system. This is the standard way to implement automatic dark mode.

### The `.visually-hidden` Utility

- This is a crucial accessibility class. It hides content from view but keeps it accessible to screen readers. This is the standard method for providing descriptive text for icons or other visual elements without cluttering the UI.
