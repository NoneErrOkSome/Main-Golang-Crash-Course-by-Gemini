Of course. Here is a detailed comparison of the old and new routing methods, presented in an obvious, side-by-side format based on the lecturer's explanation.

### The Core Difference

The fundamental change is moving from a simple, built-in approach where routes are mixed into `main.go` to a more organized, professional pattern where routes are isolated in their own file and managed by a specialized "mux" (router).

### Comparison Table

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Old Routing (The "Awkward" Way)**|**New Routing (The "Cleaner" Way)**|
|**Location of Code**|All routing logic is placed directly inside the `main.go` file.|All routing logic is isolated in its own dedicated file, `routes.go`.|
|**Technology Used**|It uses Go's built-in `http.HandleFunc` function, which registers each route with a default, global server instance.|It uses a specialized third-party package (`pat`) to create a router object, also known as a **mux** or **multiplexer**.|
|**Organization**|It's a simple, flat list of function calls. As the application grows, this list becomes long and clutters the `main` function.|A single function (`Routes`) is responsible for creating, configuring, and returning a self-contained router object (`mux`).|
|**Flexibility**|Less flexible. It's tied to the default server, and advanced routing features are not available out-of-the-box.|Highly flexible. The `pat` mux has specific methods for different HTTP verbs (e.g., `mux.Get`, `mux.Post`) and can be easily swapped for another router package later.|
|**Readability**|The `main.go` file's purpose becomes diluted as it gets filled with dozens of route definitions.|The `main.go` file is significantly "cleaner." Its job is clearly to start the server, while `routes.go` clearly handles all routing.|

### Obvious Code Comparison

Here is what the code looks like for both approaches, making the difference clear.

#### **Old Routing Code (in `main.go`)**

With this method, your `main.go` file has a direct list of every route in your application.

Go

```Go
// From the old main.go

// Every route is listed here, one by one.
http.HandleFunc("/", handlers.Home)
http.HandleFunc("/about", handlers.About)
// ... if you had 50 more pages, you would have 50 more lines here.

_ = http.ListenAndServe(portNumber, nil) // The 'nil' means use the default router
```

#### **New Routing Code (Split between `routes.go` and `main.go`)**

With the new method, the `main.go` file is simple, and the routing details are hidden away in `routes.go`.

**1. The `routes.go` file (The new home for routing logic):**

Go

```Go
// This file contains all the routing details.
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"bookings-udemy/pkg/config"
	"bookings-udemy/pkg/handlers"
	"github.com/bmizerany/pat"
)

func Routes(app *config.AppConfig) http.Handler {
	mux := pat.New() // Create the specialized router

	// Define routes on the mux
	mux.Get("/", http.HandlerFunc(handlers.Repo.Home))
	mux.Get("/about", http.HandlerFunc(handlers.Repo.About))

	return mux // Return the configured router
}
```

**2. The `main.go` file (Now much cleaner):**

Go

```Go
// The new main.go is very clean.
package main

// ... imports ...

func main() {
	var app config.AppConfig
	// ... app configuration setup ...

	srv := &http.Server{
		Addr:    portNumber,
		Handler: routes(&app), // The single, clean call to get all routes
	}

	err := srv.ListenAndServe()
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```

In short, the new approach treats routing as a distinct, important part of the application that deserves its own file and its own specialized tools, leading to a much more organized and scalable project.
