Based on the text provided, **routing** is the process of matching an incoming web request's URL path (e.g., `/` or `/about`) to the specific Go function that is responsible for handling that request and generating a response.

The lecturer explains this by refactoring the application's routing mechanism. Here's a breakdown of the concept based on the text:

### 1. The Original Problem

Initially, the application's routing was handled directly in the `main.go` file using Go's built-in `http.HandleFunc`. The lecturer notes that this approach is "really kind of awkward when you start getting a more complex web application."



```Go
// The old way, commented out in main.go
// http.HandleFunc("/", handlers.Home)
// http.HandleFunc("/about", handlers.About)
```

### 2. The New Solution: Isolated Routing with a Multiplexer

To solve this, the lecturer implements a more organized approach with two key changes:

- **Isolating the Routes:** A new file, `routes.go`, is created specifically to contain all the routing logic, keeping it separate from the main application setup.
    
- **Using a Multiplexer (Mux):** Instead of Go's built-in router, a third-party package called `pat` (`github.com/bmizerany/pat`) is introduced. This package provides a "mux" or "multiplexer." In this context, the mux is an HTTP handler that knows how to inspect the request's URL and delegate it to other handlers.
    

### 3. How the New Routing Works

The new `routes.go` file contains a function called `Routes` that builds and configures the `pat` mux:

1. **Create the Mux:** A new mux is created with `pat.New()`.
    
2. **Define Routes:** Specific routes are registered on the mux. For example, a `GET` request for the path `/` is mapped to the `handlers.Repo.Home` function.
    
    Go
    
    ```Go
    // Inside routes.go
    mux := pat.New()
    
    mux.Get("/", http.HandlerFunc(handlers.Repo.Home))
    mux.Get("/about", http.HandlerFunc(handlers.Repo.About))
    ```
    
3. **Return the Mux:** The fully configured mux, which is itself a valid `http.Handler`, is returned by the `Routes` function.
    
4. **Integrate in `main.go`:** In the `main.go` file, this `Routes` function is called, and its return value (the mux) is assigned as the primary handler for the entire web server.

    
    ```Go
    // Inside main.go
    srv := &http.Server{
        Addr:    portNumber,
        Handler: routes(&app), // The mux from routes.go is now handling all requests
    }
    err = srv.ListenAndServe()
    ```
    

In summary, routing is the application's traffic cop. The lecturer's changes move this logic from a series of individual rules in `main.go` to a centralized, dedicated routing file that uses a specialized `pat` mux to direct traffic, resulting in a "much cleaner" and better-organized application.
