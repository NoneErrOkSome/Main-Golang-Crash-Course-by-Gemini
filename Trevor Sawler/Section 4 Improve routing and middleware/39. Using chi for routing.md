Based on the lecture you provided, here are the answers to your questions.

### 1. What is the difference to `pat`?

The primary difference highlighted by the lecturer is that the **`chi` router comes with built-in middleware**, which the `pat` router does not have.

- **Middleware:** The lecturer explains that "Middleware allows us to process requests as they come in and make decisions about what to do with them." He gives the example of using middleware to check if a user is logged in before allowing them to see a certain page.
- **`chi`'s Features:** The `chi` package provides several useful middlewares out-of-the-box, such as:
    - `Recoverer`: To gracefully handle application "panics" (crashes) without the whole server dying.
    - `Logger`: To log information about each request.
    - `Compress`: To compress responses.
- **Similar API:** The basic way of defining routes (e.g., `mux.Get("/", handler)`) is described as "a very similar approach" to `pat`, so the core routing functionality is comparable. The main advantage of `chi` is the addition of the powerful middleware features.

### 2. What did the lecturer try to do?

The lecturer performed a "component swap." He **replaced the `pat` router with the `chi` router** in the application.

This involved a few distinct steps:

1. **Install the new package:** He used the command `go get github.com/go-chi/chi` to download the `chi` router.
2. **Update the code:** In the `routes.go` file, he replaced the line `mux := pat.New()` with `mux := chi.NewRouter()`.
3. **Clean up dependencies:** He ran the command `go mod tidy` in the terminal to automatically remove the now-unused `pat` package from the `go.mod` file.
4. **Add Middleware:** He took advantage of `chi`'s features by adding the `Recoverer` middleware to the new router using `mux.Use(middleware.Recoverer)`.

### 3. What is the reason for doing this?

The lecturer gave two clear reasons for swapping the routers:

1. **To Demonstrate a Good Architecture:** The first reason was purely educational. He wanted to prove that **"if you keep things separated from one another and keep things really clean, you can swap out an entire component of your package in just a couple of minutes."** By having all the routing logic isolated in `routes.go`, changing the underlying router technology was easy and had minimal impact on the rest of the application.
    
2. **To Use the Features of `chi` (Middleware):** The second, more practical reason was to gain access to `chi`'s built-in middleware. He immediately implemented the `Recoverer` middleware to make the application more robust by preventing it from crashing if a "panic" occurs. He explicitly states he wants to use middleware, and that this is a major reason for choosing `chi`.
