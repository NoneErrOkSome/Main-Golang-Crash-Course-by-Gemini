In Go (Golang), a **struct** (short for "structure") is a user-defined composite data type that allows you to group together related fields (variables) of different data types into a single unit. It's similar to classes in object-oriented programming languages, but Go structs are more lightweight and don't have built-in inheritance.

Here are the fundamental concepts of Go structs:

### 1. Defining a Struct

You define a struct using the `type` keyword, followed by the struct's name, and then the `struct` keyword, followed by a block of curly braces `{}` containing its fields. Each field has a name and a type.

**Syntax:**



```Go
type StructName struct {
    FieldName1 Type1
    FieldName2 Type2
    FieldName3 Type3
}
```

**Example:**



```Go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a Person struct
type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    IsAdult bool
}

func main() {
    // ...
}
```

You can also declare fields of the same type on one line:



```Go
type Product struct {
    Name, Category string
    Price          float64
    InStock        bool
}
```

### 2. Declaring and Initializing Structs

There are several ways to declare and initialize struct variables:

a) Zero-value Initialization:

When you declare a struct variable without explicitly initializing its fields, they are set to their respective zero values (e.g., 0 for int, "" for string, false for bool, nil for pointers, slices, maps, etc.).



```Go
var p1 Person // p1.Name = "", p1.Age = 0, p1.IsAdult = false
fmt.Println(p1) // Output: { 0 false}
```

b) Field-by-Field Assignment:

You can assign values to individual fields using the dot . operator.



```Go
var p2 Person
p2.Name = "Alice"
p2.Age = 30
p2.IsAdult = true
fmt.Println(p2) // Output: {Alice 30 true}
```

c) Struct Literal (Order-based):

You can initialize a struct by providing values for all fields in the order they are defined in the struct. This method requires providing values for all fields.



```Go
p3 := Person{"Bob", 25, true}
fmt.Println(p3) // Output: {Bob 25 true}
```

d) Struct Literal (Named Fields):

This is generally the preferred way, as it's more readable and less error-prone if the struct definition changes. You specify the field names along with their values. The order of fields doesn't matter here, and you can omit fields, which will then take their zero values.



```Go
p4 := Person{Name: "Charlie", Age: 40, IsAdult: true}
fmt.Println(p4) // Output: {Charlie 40 true}

p5 := Person{Name: "David"} // Age and IsAdult will be zero values (0, false)
fmt.Println(p5) // Output: {David 0 false}
```

e) Pointer to a Struct:

You can also create a pointer to a struct. The & operator takes the address of the struct literal.



```Go
ptrPerson := &Person{Name: "Eve", Age: 22, IsAdult: true}
fmt.Println(ptrPerson) // Output: &{Eve 22 true} (prints the address and then the struct content)
fmt.Println(ptrPerson.Name) // You can still use the dot operator with pointers, Go automatically dereferences it.
```

### 3. Accessing Struct Fields

You access individual fields of a struct using the dot `.` operator:



```Go
fmt.Println(p4.Name)    // Output: Charlie
fmt.Println(p4.Age)     // Output: 40
fmt.Println(p4.IsAdult) // Output: true
```

### 4. Structs as Function Arguments and Return Values

Structs can be passed as arguments to functions and returned from functions, just like any other data type.



```Go
func printPersonDetails(p Person) {
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Adult: %t\n", p.Name, p.Age, p.IsAdult)
}

func createPerson(name string, age int, isAdult bool) Person {
    return Person{
        Name:    name,
        Age:     age,
        IsAdult: isAdult,
    }
}

func main() {
    // ... (previous struct definitions and initializations)

    printPersonDetails(p4) // Output: Name: Charlie, Age: 40, Adult: true

    newP := createPerson("Frank", 17, false)
    printPersonDetails(newP) // Output: Name: Frank, Age: 17, Adult: false
}
```

### 5. Methods on Structs

One of the most powerful features of structs in Go is the ability to define **methods** on them. A method is a function associated with a specific struct type.



```Go
type Rectangle struct {
    Width  float64
    Height float64
}

// Area is a method with a value receiver (r Rectangle)
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

// Scale is a method with a pointer receiver (*r Rectangle)
// It modifies the original struct.
func (r *Rectangle) Scale(factor float64) {
    r.Width *= factor
    r.Height *= factor
}

func main() {
    rect := Rectangle{Width: 10, Height: 5}
    fmt.Printf("Initial Area: %.2f\n", rect.Area()) // Output: Initial Area: 50.00

    rect.Scale(2) // Scale the rectangle by a factor of 2
    fmt.Printf("Scaled Area: %.2f\n", rect.Area()) // Output: Scaled Area: 200.00
}
```

- **Value Receiver (`(r Rectangle)`):** When a method has a value receiver, it operates on a copy of the struct. Changes made inside the method will not affect the original struct. This is suitable for methods that only read data from the struct.
- **Pointer Receiver (`(*r Rectangle)`):** When a method has a pointer receiver, it operates on the original struct directly. Changes made inside the method _will_ affect the original struct. This is necessary for methods that modify the struct's fields.

### 6. Struct Embedding (Composition)

Go doesn't have traditional inheritance, but it achieves similar functionality through **struct embedding** (also known as composition). You can embed one struct within another, and the fields and methods of the embedded struct are "promoted" to the outer struct.



```Go
type Address struct {
    Street string
    City   string
    Zip    string
}

type Employee struct {
    Name string
    ID   int
    Address // Embedded Address struct
}

func main() {
    emp := Employee{
        Name: "Grace",
        ID:   123,
        Address: Address{
            Street: "123 Go Lane",
            City:   "Gopher Town",
            Zip:    "10001",
        },
    }

    fmt.Println(emp.Name)       // Output: Grace
    fmt.Println(emp.City)       // Accessing embedded field directly
    fmt.Println(emp.Address.City) // Also works, but emp.City is more idiomatic
}
```

### 7. Anonymous Structs

You can define structs without a name if you only need them for a single, specific purpose. This is often used for temporary data structures or in test cases.



```Go
func main() {
    // Anonymous struct
    data := struct {
        Key   string
        Value int
    }{
        Key:   "item1",
        Value: 100,
    }

    fmt.Println(data.Key, data.Value) // Output: item1 100
}
```

### Key Takeaways:

- **Grouping Data:** Structs are excellent for grouping related pieces of data, even if they are of different types, into a single logical unit.
- **Type Safety:** They provide compile-time type checking, helping prevent errors.
- **Encapsulation:** Structs allow you to encapsulate data, making your code more organized and easier to manage.
- **No Inheritance (Composition over Inheritance):** Go promotes composition (struct embedding) over traditional class inheritance for code reuse.
- **Methods:** You can attach behavior (methods) to your structs, making them more powerful and organized.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Structs in Go are generally memory-efficient because their fields are laid out contiguously in memory.

Structs are a fundamental building block in Go programming and are used extensively for representing data models and creating custom types.
