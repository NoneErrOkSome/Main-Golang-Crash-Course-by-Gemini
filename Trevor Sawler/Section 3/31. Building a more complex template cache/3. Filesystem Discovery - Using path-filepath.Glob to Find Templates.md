### Topic 3: Filesystem Discovery: Using `path/filepath.Glob` to Find Templates

#### Introduction: The Bridge to the Filesystem

For any automated caching system to work, it first needs a reliable way to answer a fundamental question: "What files are actually available?" Hardcoding a list of filenames is brittle and unscalable, as we established in Topic 1. The application needs a dynamic way to query the filesystem and discover the resources it depends on.

This is where Go's standard library provides a powerful and elegant solution: the `path/filepath.Glob` function. This function acts as a crucial bridge between the abstract logic of our Go application and the concrete reality of the files and folders on the operating system's disk. It allows us to move from a system that needs to be _told_ what files exist to one that can _find out_ for itself.

#### What is "Globbing"?

Before diving into the Go function, it's important to understand the concept of "globbing." The term "glob," originating from early Unix systems, is shorthand for "global command" and refers to the process of using wildcard characters to generate a list of matching filenames. It's a pattern-matching system specifically for file paths.

The most common wildcard character, and the only one used in our code, is the **asterisk (`*`)**.

- **The Asterisk (`*`):** Represents a "wildcard" that matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

For example, given the pattern `*.page.tmpl`, the glob mechanism will find any file that ends with that exact suffix, regardless of what comes before it.

- `home.page.tmpl` **matches**.
- `about.page.tmpl` **matches**.
- `base.layout.tmpl` does **not match**.
- `my-long-contact-page.page.tmpl` **matches**.

This simple pattern language is incredibly powerful for selecting groups of files based on a shared naming convention.

#### Dissecting `path/filepath.Glob` in Go

The lecturer made a specific choice to use the `filepath` package, which is a critical detail for writing professional, portable code.

The path/filepath Package vs. path

Go has two packages for handling paths: path and path/filepath. The path package should be used for URL paths, which always use forward slashes (/). The path/filepath package is for handling filesystem paths on the user's operating system. It automatically uses the correct path separator—/ on Linux and macOS, and \ on Windows—making your code portable across different environments without any changes.

The Function Signature

The Glob function is defined as follows:

Go

```go
func Glob(pattern string) ([]string, error)
```

Let's break down its input and outputs:

- **Input (`pattern string`):** This is the single argument to the function. It's a string containing the path and glob pattern to match. In our code, we use `"./templates/*.page.tmpl"`. This tells Go to look in the `templates` directory (relative to the application's execution path) for any file matching the `*` wildcard that ends in `.page.tmpl`.
    
- **Output 1 (`[]string`):** If the function succeeds, its primary return value is a _slice of strings_. Each string in the slice is the full, matched file path (e.g., `"templates/home.page.tmpl"`). **Crucially, if no files match the pattern, `Glob` does not return an error.** It simply returns an empty slice (`[]`), which has a length of 0. This is predictable and easy to handle in code.
    
- **Output 2 (`error`):** An error is only returned if the `pattern` string itself is malformed or if there's an underlying issue reading the directory. For a simple pattern like `"*.tmpl"`, an error is highly unlikely. This error return allows us to handle unexpected issues gracefully.
    

Practical Application in the Code

Let's look at the exact lines from our createTemplateCache function:

1. `pages, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.page.tmpl")`
    
    - **Action:** This line executes a search. It asks the operating system, "Please give me a list of every file in the `./templates` directory that ends with the exact text `.page.tmpl`."
    - **Result:** The resulting list of full file paths is stored in the `pages` slice. The `err` variable will be `nil` if the search was successful (even if nothing was found).
2. `matches, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")`
    
    - **Action:** This performs a second, independent search inside the `for` loop. It asks, "Give me a list of every file in the `./templates` directory that ends with `.layout.tmpl`."
    - **Result:** The list of layout file paths is stored in the `matches` slice.

#### The Advantages Over Manual Directory Traversal

One could achieve a similar result by manually reading the directory's contents and looping through them, checking each filename with a function like `strings.HasSuffix`. However, using `filepath.Glob` is superior for several reasons:

- **Conciseness and Intent:** `filepath.Glob` is a single, declarative line of code. Its purpose is immediately clear to any developer reading it, whereas a manual loop requires more code and mental parsing to understand the intent.
- **Correctness and Portability:** As mentioned, `filepath` handles all OS-specific details. A manual implementation might incorrectly handle path separators or other edge cases, making the code less robust.
- **Simplicity:** It cleanly separates the concern of _finding files_ from the concern of _processing files_.

#### Robust Error Handling

Our code correctly handles the potential for errors from `Glob`:

Go

```go
pages, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.page.tmpl")
if err != nil {
	return myCache, err
}
```

This ensures that if the filesystem interaction fails for any unexpected reason (e.g., a permissions issue, a malformed pattern), the `createTemplateCache` function will stop immediately and report the failure. This aligns with the "fail-fast" principle, preventing the application from continuing in an invalid state.

#### Conclusion

`filepath.Glob` is far more than a simple utility function; it is the cornerstone of our new automated caching architecture. It provides a robust, portable, and highly expressive way for our application to discover its own resources at runtime. By leveraging globbing, we decouple our Go code from the specific contents of the `templates` directory, allowing developers to add, remove, or rename template files with confidence, knowing that the application will automatically adapt without requiring a single line of code to be changed. This makes the entire system more resilient, maintainable, and scalable.
