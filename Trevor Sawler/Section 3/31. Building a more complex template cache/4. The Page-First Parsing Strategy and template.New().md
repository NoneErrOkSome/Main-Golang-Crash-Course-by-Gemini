### Topic 4: The Page-First Parsing Strategy and `template.New()`

#### Introduction: The Challenge of Parsing Dependent Templates

Once the application has successfully discovered all the template files using `filepath.Glob`, the next challenge is to parse them in a way that respects their dependencies. In our architecture, a "page" template (like `home.page.tmpl`) is not a standalone file; it is designed to be rendered within the structure of a "layout" template (`base.layout.tmpl`).

Getting this right is not as simple as throwing all the files at the parser at once. The `html/template` package has a specific model for how templates are associated and named. The lecturer's "Page-First" strategy, enabled by the `template.New()` function, is a deliberate and crucial technique designed to correctly construct and, most importantly, correctly _identify_ the final, renderable template objects for our cache.

---

#### The `html/template` Dependency Model

To understand the strategy, we must first understand how Go templates work together:

1. **The Layout (`base.layout.tmpl`):** Defines the main HTML skeleton. It uses a `{{define "block-name"}}` action to create a placeholder that other templates can fill. It is a reusable container.
2. **The Page (`home.page.tmpl`):** Contains the specific content for one page. It declares its dependency on a layout by starting with `{{template "layout-name" .}}`. It then fills the placeholders defined in the layout.

For the `home` page to render correctly, the Go runtime needs to have parsed **both** the home page's content and the base layout's structure into a single, unified template "set." The challenge is how to build this set while ensuring its final name or identity corresponds to the _page_, not the layout.

---

#### The Naive Approach and Its Critical Flaw

A developer new to the `html/template` package might ask, "Why not just parse all the files together like this?"

Go

```go
// The naive, incorrect approach
// Let's say we want to parse the home page and its layout.
filesToParse := []string{"./templates/base.layout.tmpl", "./templates/home.page.tmpl"}
ts, err := template.ParseFiles(filesToParse...)
```

This will successfully parse both files into a valid template set. However, it has a fatal flaw related to naming. When `template.ParseFiles` is called as a standalone function (not a method on an existing template), it **names the entire resulting template set after the first file in the slice**.

In the example above, the name of the final `ts` object would be `base.layout.tmpl`.

If we tried to put this in our cache, we would execute `myCache["base.layout.tmpl"] = ts`. This is not what we want. When a request comes in for the `/home` route, our handler will look in the cache for the key `"home.page.tmpl"`. It will not find it, because the correctly parsed template is stored under the wrong key. This naive approach creates a cache that cannot be correctly looked up.

---

#### The Solution: `template.New()` - Creating a Named "Container"

The lecturer's strategy solves this identity crisis by using `template.New()`. This function is the key to controlling the name of the final template set.

Let's dissect the code from the lecture:

Go

```go
// 1. Get the simple filename to use as the name/key.
name := filepath.Base(page) // e.g., name becomes "home.page.tmpl"

// 2. Create a new, named, empty template set, then parse the page file into it.
ts, err := template.New(name).ParseFiles(page)
```

This single line of code is performing a sequence of critical operations:

1. **`template.New(name)`**: This is the first and most important step. It creates a brand new, completely empty template set. Think of it as creating an empty, labeled container. The crucial part is that we give it a `name` from the start. In our example, we are creating an empty template set explicitly named `"home.page.tmpl"`.
2. **`.ParseFiles(page)`**: This is now a **method call** on the empty set we just created. It reads the contents of the `page` file (e.g., `./templates/home.page.tmpl`) and parses its definitions _into_ the container named `"home.page.tmpl"`.

After this line executes, the variable `ts` holds a `*template.Template` object that is correctly identified as `"home.page.tmpl"` and contains the parsed content of that single file.

---

#### "Page-First" Strategy: Building Upon the Named Container

We now have a template set that is correctly named after the page. This is the "Page-First" part of the strategy—the page defines the identity of the final product.

The next step is to add the shared layout templates to this existing set:

Go

```go
// ts is our existing set, named "home.page.tmpl"
if len(matches) > 0 {
    // 3. Add the layout definitions to the EXISTING template set 'ts'.
    ts, err = ts.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
}
```

The `ts.ParseGlob()` function is also a method call on our existing `ts` object. It finds all files matching the layout pattern and parses their contents, but instead of creating a new template set, it **adds the new definitions to the one we already have**.

The `ts` object now contains the parsed definitions from _both_ `home.page.tmpl` and `base.layout.tmpl`. Crucially, its name—the identity we established with `template.New()`—remains `"home.page.tmpl"`.

When the loop finishes and we execute `myCache[name] = ts`, we are correctly storing the complete, renderable template object in our map under the key `"home.page.tmpl"`.

#### Conclusion

The Page-First parsing strategy, orchestrated by `template.New()`, is not an arbitrary choice; it is a required technique for building a functional, automated template cache. It solves the critical problem of naming and identity that the simpler `template.ParseFiles` function cannot.

By first creating a named "container" for each page, and then subsequently parsing the shared layouts into that container, this strategy ensures that each entry in our final cache map is:

1. **Correctly Keyed:** The map key (`home.page.tmpl`) directly corresponds to the page a handler will request.
2. **Complete:** The associated value (`*template.Template`) contains all the necessary definitions from both the page and its required layouts to be rendered successfully.

This deliberate parsing order is fundamental to bridging the gap between a directory of files and a perfectly structured, high-performance in-memory cache.
