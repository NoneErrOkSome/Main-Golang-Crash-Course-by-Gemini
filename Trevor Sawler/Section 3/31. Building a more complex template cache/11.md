Of course. My apologies for jumping ahead to the final solution. Let's get you oriented to where you are right now, at the end of the lecture you provided.

Here is a summary of your current project status.

### Where You Are At: The "Deliberate Flaw" Stage

You have successfully built a sophisticated, automated cache **creation engine**, but you have intentionally implemented it in a way that is **highly inefficient**. This was the lecturer's specific goal for this stage.

#### What You Have Accomplished (The Good Parts):

1. **Automated Template Discovery:** You have a function, `createTemplateCache`, that no longer requires you to manually list files. It uses `filepath.Glob` to automatically find all `*.page.tmpl` and `*.layout.tmpl` files. This solves the main problem of the _previous_ caching method.
2. **Correct Template Association:** Your code correctly parses each page file and then associates it with all available layouts, creating a complete, renderable template object.
3. **It Works:** The application runs. When you visit a URL like `/home` or `/about`, the pages render correctly to the browser.

#### The Critical Flaw (The Problem You Need to Solve Next):

The major issue is **when and where** you are building the cache.

- **The Flaw:** The line `tc, err := createTemplateCache()` is located **inside** your `RenderTemplate` function.
- **The Consequence:** Because `RenderTemplate` is called for every single page request, you are rebuilding the **entire template cache from scratch on every request**.
- **The Impact:** Instead of being a fast, efficient system, your application is now slower than it was with no cache at all. It reads every single template file from the disk, parses it, and builds a new map every time a user clicks a link or refreshes the page.

You are currently at a stage where you have proven you _can_ build the cache automatically, but you have not yet made it _persistent_.

### Your Current Code

This is the code that accurately reflects where you are at the end of the lecture. It is the version with the deliberate flaw.

Go

```Go
package render

import (
	"bytes"
	"html/template"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"path/filepath"
)

// RenderTemplate renders a template
func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
	// THE FLAW: This line is executed on EVERY request, rebuilding the cache every time.
	tc, err := createTemplateCache()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// get requested template from cache
	t, ok := tc[tmpl]
	if !ok {
		// Note: The lecturer's code had a bug here. It should be a clear error message.
		log.Fatalf("The template %s does not exist", tmpl)
	}

	// create a buffer to handle potential errors more gracefully
	buf := new(bytes.Buffer)

	err = t.Execute(buf, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}

	// render the template by writing the buffer to the response writer
	_, err = buf.WriteTo(w)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}
}

// createTemplateCache creates a template cache as a map
func createTemplateCache() (map[string]*template.Template, error) {
	myCache := map[string]*template.Template{}

	// get all of the files named *.page.tmpl from ./templates
	pages, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.page.tmpl")
	if err != nil {
		return myCache, err
	}

	// range through all files ending with *.page.tmpl
	for _, page := range pages {
		name := filepath.Base(page)
		ts, err := template.New(name).ParseFiles(page)
		if err != nil {
			return myCache, err
		}

		matches, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
		if err != nil {
			return myCache, err
		}

		if len(matches) > 0 {
			ts, err = ts.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
			if err != nil {
				return myCache, err
			}
		}

		myCache[name] = ts
	}

	return myCache, nil
}

```

### The Path Forward

Your very next step is to solve this inefficiency. You need to:

1. Move the call to `createTemplateCache()` **out** of the `RenderTemplate` function.
2. Call it only **once**, when the application first starts.
3. Store the resulting cache in a place that all your handlers can access for the entire life of the application.

This is exactly what the lecturer intended to solve by introducing an **Application Configuration**. The complete code I showed you in the previous answer is the solution to this exact problem.
