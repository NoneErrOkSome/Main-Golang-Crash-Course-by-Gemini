### Topic 9: The Deliberate Flaw: Inefficient Caching on Every Request

#### Introduction: The Twist in the Tale

After meticulously building a sophisticated and automated cache-creation engine in the `createTemplateCache` function, the lecturer takes a surprising and seemingly counter-intuitive step. He wires this powerful new function into the application in a way that is not just inefficient, but is fundamentally opposed to the very principle of caching.

This is the "deliberate flaw." It is not a mistake but a crucial pedagogical tool. By implementing the solution to one problem (automated discovery) in a way that creates another, more obvious problem (performance degradation), the lecturer masterfully isolates and highlights the next critical architectural challenge: state management and the application lifecycle. Understanding this intentional flaw is key to grasping the overall narrative of building a production-ready application.

#### Pinpointing the Flaw: The Source of the Inefficiency

The entire problem is located in a single, seemingly innocuous line within the `RenderTemplate` function, which is executed for every single page request.

Go

```Go
// in render.go

func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
	// THE FLAW: This line is executed on EVERY HTTP request.
	tc, err := createTemplateCache()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

Every time a user visits a page—be it the homepage, the about page, or a page reload—the `createTemplateCache()` function is called anew. This means that for every single request, the application performs the following expensive sequence of operations:

1. **Initializes a new, empty map** (`myCache`).
2. **Hits the disk:** Calls `filepath.Glob` to find all files ending in `*.page.tmpl`.
3. **Starts a loop:** Iterates through every page file it found.
4. **Hits the disk again (inside the loop):** Calls `filepath.Glob` _again_ to find all `*.layout.tmpl` files.
5. **Reads and Parses files (inside the loop):** Calls `template.New().ParseFiles()` and `ts.ParseGlob()`, which read the content of the page and layout files from the disk and use the CPU to parse them into an in-memory structure.
6. **Populates the map:** Adds the newly parsed template to the `myCache` map.
7. **Returns the map:** After processing all pages, it returns the fully built map.

This entire, multi-step, disk- and CPU-intensive process is repeated from scratch for every single click and page refresh.

#### The Performance Impact: An "Anti-Cache"

The very definition of a cache is a mechanism to store the result of an expensive operation so that you do **not** have to perform it again. The current implementation does the exact opposite; it is, in effect, an "anti-cache."

Let's compare its performance to the previous versions:

- **vs. No Cache at All:** The very first, simple `RenderTemplateTEst` function read exactly two files from disk per request (the specific page and the one layout). The new implementation reads _all_ page files and _all_ layout files on _every_ request. If you have 10 pages and 2 layouts, it now performs significantly more disk I/O than having no cache at all.
- **vs. The Simple "Lazy Loading" Cache:** The first caching model was far more efficient. It read files from disk only on the _first hit_ for a given page. All subsequent hits were served instantly from memory.

The lecturer himself summarizes the situation perfectly: _"all we've done so far... is make things more complex and harder to read. We haven't made it any faster at all."_ In fact, he has made it demonstrably slower. The application is now working harder than ever before to render a single page.

#### The Pedagogical Rationale: Why Create a Deliberate Flaw?

If the implementation is so bad, why do it this way? The answer is that it's a brilliant teaching strategy for isolating complex problems.

##### 1. Solving One Problem at a Time

Building a good, automated caching system involves solving at least two distinct problems:

- **Problem A (Discovery):** "How can I automatically find all my templates and their dependencies without manually listing them?"
- **Problem B (Lifecycle & State):** "When and where should I build the cache, and how do I make it available to all the parts of my application that need it?"

The `createTemplateCache` function is the complete solution to **Problem A**. By placing it directly inside the request handler, the lecturer has made **Problem B** painfully and obviously visible. The inefficiency isn't a subtle background issue; it's now the primary characteristic of the system, making it impossible to ignore.

##### 2. Creating a Clear Motivation for the Next Step

This flawed implementation serves as the perfect "cliffhanger." Any developer looking at this code would immediately say, "This is wrong, we should only be creating the cache once!" This naturally leads to the next question: "Okay, _how_ do we do that?"

The lecturer has already signposted the answer: **by creating an application configuration**. This flaw provides the perfect justification for why such a configuration is not just a "nice-to-have," but an absolute necessity for solving the problem of state management.

##### 3. Demonstrating Separation of Concerns

This exercise highlights a key software engineering principle.

- The `createTemplateCache` function has one well-defined responsibility: **build a template map**.
- The `RenderTemplate` function _should_ have one responsibility: **use a pre-built template map to render a page**.

The current flaw stems from giving `RenderTemplate` both responsibilities at once. The architectural fix will be to properly separate these concerns, having a higher-level entity (the application itself, via its configuration) be responsible for creating and holding the cache, and then passing a reference to that cache down to the rendering function.

#### Conclusion

The "deliberate flaw" is the lynchpin of the lecture's narrative arc. The lecturer has successfully guided us to build a powerful cache-creation engine, a solution to the problem of manual maintenance. He then immediately uses that solution incorrectly to expose the next, more abstract challenge: managing application state and lifecycle.

It's a powerful lesson that distinguishes between an _algorithm_ (a function that can create a cache) and an _architecture_ (a system that knows how to use that cache correctly). The application is now perfectly poised for its final evolution, where the cache will be created once at startup and shared globally, a task for which the promised "application configuration" is the clear and necessary solution.
