Based on the lecture, he is trying to achieve two main things before moving on:

1. **Solve the Manual Maintenance Problem:** His primary goal was to create a more advanced template caching system that **automatically discovers and parses all templates and layouts**. He successfully built a function (`createTemplateCache`) that scans the file system for all files ending in `.page.tmpl` and correctly associates them with any `.layout.tmpl` files. This means he no longer has to manually update a list of files every time he adds a new partial or layout, which was the main drawback of the previous, simpler caching method.
    
2. **Expose the Next Major Flaw to Be Solved:** While he solved the maintenance problem, he intentionally implemented it in an inefficient way to set up the next lecture. He has created a new, more significant problem: **the entire template cache is being rebuilt from scratch on every single request.**
    

In summary, before continuing his lecture, he has successfully built an automated template discovery system but has left it in a state where it is highly inefficient. His goal was to demonstrate **how** to automatically build the cache, while leaving the problem of **when** to build it (i.e., only once at startup, not on every request) as the clear, unsolved issue to be tackled next by introducing an application configuration.
