### A Study Guide: Handling Errors in Your Go Web App

When you're building an application, things can go wrong. A user might type in bad data, a file might be missing, or a calculation might be impossible. A great program doesn't just crash; it handles these problems gracefully. This guide will walk you through the standard way to create and handle errors in Go.

#### The Big Picture: Why We're Doing This

Our goal is to create a new page for our web app at the URL `/divide`. This page will perform a division calculation. The main reason we're choosing division is because it has a classic error case: you can't divide by zero! This gives us a perfect opportunity to practice handling errors properly.

To keep our code clean, we'll use a common pattern:

1. **A Handler Function (`Divide`):** This function's job is to handle the web stuff—the request from the user and writing a response back.
2. **A Worker Function (`divideValues`):** This function does the actual work—the math. It doesn't know anything about the web; it just takes numbers and returns a result.

This separation makes our code easier to read and test.

#### Part 1: Building a Function That Can Fail

The most important concept in Go error handling is that **functions that can fail should return an error.**

Let's look at our worker function, `divideValues`.

**The Function Signature:**

Go

```Go
func divideValues(x, y float32) (float32, error)
```

This signature is a contract. It says: "I will always give you back two things: a `float32` number (the result) AND an `error`."

- The `error` type is built into Go.
- If the function succeeds, the `error` it returns will be **`nil`**. In Go, `nil` means "nothing" or "empty." So, a `nil` error means "no error occurred."
- If the function fails, it will return an actual `error` object with a message inside.

**The Function's Logic:**

Go

```Go
func divideValues(x, y float32) (float32, error) {
    // First, check for the bad situation.
    if y <= 0 {
        // Create a new error message.
        err := errors.New("Cannot divide by zero")
        // Return a zero result and the error we just created.
        return 0, err
    }

    // If the input is okay, do the math.
    result := x / y
    // Return the result and 'nil' to signal success.
    return result, nil
}
```

Here, we use the built-in `errors` package to create our own custom error message with `errors.New()`.

#### Part 2: Checking for Errors in the Handler

Now that our worker function can tell us when something goes wrong, our handler function needs to listen for it.

**The Golden Rule of Go:**

You will type this line more than any other in Go:

Go

```Go
if err != nil {
    // Something went wrong! Handle it.
}
```

This simply means, "If the error variable is _not_ empty (`nil`), then we have a problem."

Let's see it in our `Divide` handler:

Go

```Go
func Divide(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Call the worker function and get both return values.
    f, err := divideValues(100.0, 0.0)

    // Apply the Golden Rule!
    if err != nil {
        // If we get here, it means divideValues returned an error.
        // 1. Tell the user what happened.
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Cannot divide by 0")
        // 2. IMPORTANT: Stop the function right here!
        return
    }

    // This code only runs if err was nil (i.e., everything was okay).
    fmt.Fprintf(w, fmt.Sprintf("%f divided by %f is %f", 100.0, 0.0, f))
}
```

#### Part 3: The Critical Mistake to Avoid (The `return` Statement)

In the code above, the `return` on line 11 is maybe the most important part of the error handling block.

**What happens if you forget it?**

Go

```Go
// WRONG VERSION - MISSING 'return'
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Cannot divide by 0")
    // Oh no, we forgot to return!
}
// The function KEEPS GOING and will run this line too!
fmt.Fprintf(w, fmt.Sprintf("%f divided by %f is %f", 100.0, 0.0, f))
```

If you try to divide by zero with the "wrong version" of the code, your user would see a confusing message like:

Cannot divide by 0100.000000 divided by 0.000000 is 0.000000

The program printed the error message, but then it just kept on running and printed the success message too! The `return` statement acts like an **eject button**. It stops the function immediately after you've handled the error.

### Key Takeaways

- **Functions that might fail should return an `error` as their last return value.** This is the standard Go pattern.
- **Always check for the error.** As soon as you call a function that can fail, your very next step should be `if err != nil`.
- **`nil` means success.** If the returned `error` is `nil`, everything went according to plan.
- **Handle the error, then `return`.** When you catch an error, tell the user what happened and then stop the function immediately with `return` to prevent more code from running.
