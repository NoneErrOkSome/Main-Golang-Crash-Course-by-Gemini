### Topic 4: The Code Change - Parsing Multiple Files

#### The Problem: "No Such Template" Error

After restructuring the templates to use a base layout, running the application results in a blank screen in the browser1. The terminal reveals a specific error message: `error parsing template: ... "home.page.tmpl": template: "base": no such template`. 2

This error occurs because the Go application has not been told about the existence of the `base.layout.tmpl` file. 3 The `RenderTemplate` function was only parsing the single page template file (e.g., `home.page.tmpl`). 4 When the Go template engine tried to execute the `{{template "base" .}}` directive within that page, it could not find any parsed template with the name "base", causing the operation to fail. 5

#### The Solution: Using the Variadic `template.ParseFiles` Function

The fix for this issue is to modify the `render.go` file to ensure all necessary templates are parsed together. 6 The key is in the name of the function being used: `template.ParseFiles` (plural). 7

This function is **variadic**, which means it is designed to accept one or more filenames as arguments. 8 The solution is to provide `ParseFiles` with the path to the specific page template you want to render _and_ the path to the base layout template it depends on. 9

**The Corrected `render.go` Code**

Go

```Go
package render

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"text/template"
)

func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
	// The call to ParseFiles now includes both the page template and the layout template.
	// This ensures Go knows about the "base" template when it parses the page.
	parsedTemplate, _ := template.ParseFiles("./templates/"+tmpl, "./templates/base.layout.tmpl")
	err := parsedTemplate.Execute(w, nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error parsing template:", err)
	}
}
```

By providing both file paths, `template.ParseFiles` reads and parses them together. This makes the template engine aware of the layout named "base" when it processes the `home.page.tmpl` file, allowing it to correctly assemble the final page. With this single change, the application, once restarted, will successfully render the pages using the new layout system. 10
