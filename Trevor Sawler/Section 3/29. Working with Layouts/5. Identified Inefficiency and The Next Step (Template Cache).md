### Topic 5: Identified Inefficiency and The Next Step (Template Cache)

#### The Problem: Inefficient Rendering on Every Request

While the current `renderTemplate` function correctly renders pages using a layout, it has a significant performance flaw. 1 The function is described as "really inefficient" because it performs a series of slow operations on every single request. 2

For each page visit, the application does the following:

1. Goes to the disk and reads the page template file (e.g., `home.page.tmpl`). 3
    
2. Goes to the disk again and reads the layout file (`base.layout.tmpl`). 4
    
3. Parses both of these files. 5
    
4. Executes the resulting template. 6
    

Reading from a disk is described as a "pretty expensive" operation compared to accessing memory. 7 Repeating these expensive disk-reading and parsing steps for every user on every page load would slow down a busy application. 8

#### The Solution: Creating a Template Cache

To make the application more efficient, the proposed solution is to build a **template cache**. 9 A cache is a storage mechanism for holding frequently accessed data.

The idea is to change the workflow entirely:

- Instead of parsing files on every request, the application should parse every template file just **once** when the application first starts. 10
    
- These pre-parsed, ready-to-use templates would then be saved into a variable, suggested to be a map or a slice, which would serve as the in-memory cache. 11
    

#### The Improved Workflow

With a cache in place, the application's behavior would change significantly.

- **Old Workflow:** For every request, the application would read, parse, and execute. 12
    
- **New Workflow:**
    - **On Application Startup:** Read and parse all template files one time, storing the results in the cache.
    - **On Every Request:** Retrieve the already-parsed template from the fast in-memory cache and execute it. 13
        

This improved workflow completely leaves out the expensive disk reading and file parsing steps from the regular request cycle. 14

Building this more efficient template cache system is identified as the topic for the next lectures. 15
