Based on the provided transcript and code, here is an in-depth answer dedicated to Topic 3.

### Topic 3: Using Layouts in Page Templates with `{{template}}` and `{{define}}`

Once a master layout file (`base.layout.tmpl`) has been created with replaceable `{{block}}` sections, the individual page templates must be modified to use it. This process simplifies the page templates, leaving only the content that is unique to them.

#### Step 1: Preparing the Page Template

The process begins by opening an individual page template, like `home.page.tmpl`. All of the boilerplate HTML that is now present in the base layout is selected and deleted entirely. The only code that should be kept is the content specific to that page, which is then cut to be pasted in later.

#### Step 2: Inheriting the Layout with `{{template}}`

At the very top of the now-empty page file, a directive must be added to tell Go which layout to use. This is done with the `{{template}}` action.

**`templates/home.page.tmpl` (Initial modification)**

Go

```Go
{{template "base" .}}
```

- `template`: This is the keyword that instructs the Go template engine to include the content of another named template.
- `"base"`: This is the name of the layout to inherit. This name must exactly match the name provided in the layout file's `{{define "base"}}` directive.
- `.`: This passes the current data context down to the layout template.
- This `{{template}}` directive is special and does not require a closing `{{end}}` tag.

#### Step 3: Providing Content with `{{define}}`

After telling the page which layout to use, you must provide the actual content for the `{{block}}` placeholders defined in that layout. This is done using the `{{define}}` keyword.

The unique HTML that was cut from the page earlier is now pasted inside a `{{define "content"}} ... {{end}}` block.

Go

```Go
{{define "content"}}
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h1>This is the home page</h1>
                <p>This is some text</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{{end}}
```

- `define`: The keyword used to define a block of content that will be injected into the parent layout.
- `"content"`: The name of the block this content belongs to. This name must exactly match the name of the corresponding `{{block "content" .}}` in the `base.layout.tmpl` file.
- This directive requires a closing `{{end}}` tag.

#### The Result: A Clean and Simplified Template

By following this pattern, the page templates become much shorter and cleaner. They are reduced to two main tasks: declaring their parent layout and defining the content blocks. This same process is repeated for all other pages, like the about page, ensuring a consistent and maintainable structure.

**Final `home.page.tmpl`**

Go

```Go
{{template "base" .}}

{{define "content"}}
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h1>This is the home page</h1>
                <p>This is some text</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{{end}}
```

**Final `about.page.tmpl`**

Go

```Go
{{template "base" .}}

{{define "content"}}
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h1>This is the about page</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{{end}}
```
