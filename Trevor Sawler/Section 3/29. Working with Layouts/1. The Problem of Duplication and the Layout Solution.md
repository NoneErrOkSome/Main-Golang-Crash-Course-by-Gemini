Based on the provided transcript and code, here is a detailed explanation dedicated to Topic 1.

### Topic 1: The Problem of Duplication and the Layout Solution

#### The Problem: Wasted Effort and Repetitive Code

When building a website with multiple pages, a common issue is the duplication of code1. For instance, both the home page and the about page share the exact same HTML structure, including the `<!doctype>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, as well as the CSS links2.

The only part that truly changes between these pages is the main content3. This repetition creates a significant maintenance problem4. If you need to make a single change to a shared element, like updating the Bootstrap CSS link, you would be forced to manually edit every single file on your site5. While this is manageable for two pages, it becomes an enormous and error-prone task for a website with a hundred or a thousand pages6.

#### The Solution: A Master Layout Template

The more efficient solution to this problem is to use a layout file7. A layout acts as a single, master template that contains all the common HTML structure8. Individual pages can then use this layout and only provide the content that is unique to them9.

The process begins by creating a new file for the layout, such as `base.layout.tmpl`10. The full HTML from an existing page is then copied into this new file to serve as the foundation11.

**`templates/base.layout.tmpl`**

Go

```Go
{{define "base"}}
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport"
            content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
        <title>Document</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
            integrity="sha384-B0vP5xmATw1+K9KRQjQERJvTumQW0nPEzvF6L/Z6nronJ3oUOFUFpCjEUQouq2+l" crossorigin="anonymous">

        {{block "css" .}}

        {{end}}

    </head>
    <body>

    {{block "content" .}}

    {{end}}

    {{block "js" .}}

    {{end}}

    </body>
    </html>
{{end}}
```

To make this file function as a layout, it is wrapped in a `{{define "base"}}` directive at the top and a corresponding `{{end}}` directive at the bottom12. This does two things:

- It declares this block of HTML as a reusable template13.
    
- It gives the template a unique name, `"base"`, which other pages can then reference14.
    

This single layout file is never rendered directly to the browser; instead, its content is included in any template that uses it15.
