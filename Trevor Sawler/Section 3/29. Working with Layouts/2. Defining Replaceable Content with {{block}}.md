### Topic 2: Defining Replaceable Content with `{{block}}`

#### The Purpose of a `{{block}}`

A layout file containing only boilerplate HTML is not very useful; it needs a way to define sections where page-specific content can be inserted. This is the job of the `{{block}}` directive. A block acts as a named placeholder within a master layout that a child template can find and replace with its own unique content.

#### Creating the Main Content Block

In the `base.layout.tmpl` file, the area that changes from page to page (the main content) is identified. The static content is deleted and replaced with a `{{block}}` directive.

The syntax is as follows:

Go

```Go
{{block "content" .}}

{{end}}
```

- `{{block "content" .}}`: This opens the block.
    - `"content"`: This is a chosen name for the block. Any child template that wants to place content here must refer to it by this exact name.
    - `.`: The period is a necessary part of the syntax that is related to passing data into the block.
- `{{end}}`: This directive closes the block definition.

This creates a replaceable section named "content" inside the layout.

#### Adding Specialized Blocks for CSS and JavaScript

A layout can contain multiple blocks to allow for customization in different parts of the page. Following this principle, two more specialized blocks are added to the `base.layout.tmpl` file:

1. **A CSS Block:**
    
    - **Placement:** Added just before the closing `</head>` tag.
    - **Syntax:** `{{block "css" .}}{{end}}`
    - **Purpose:** This allows a specific page to inject its own custom CSS styles or additional `<link>` tags for stylesheets that are not needed on every other page.
2. **A JavaScript Block:**
    
    - **Placement:** Added just before the closing `</body>` tag.
    - **Syntax:** `{{block "js" .}}{{end}}`
    - **Purpose:** This allows a page to include custom JavaScript files or inline scripts that are unique to its functionality.

A child template is not required to use all of the blocks defined in a layout. If a page has no custom CSS, it can simply omit the `{{define "css"}}` section, and the block in the layout will render as empty.

With these three blocks, the `base.layout.tmpl` is transformed from a static shell into a flexible and dynamic template system, ready to be used by individual page templates.
