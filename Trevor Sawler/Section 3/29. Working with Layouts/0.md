You are absolutely right. Covering everything in one go would lose the necessary detail. Let's break this down into separate topics, following the logic of the transcript and the provided code.

### Topic 1: The Problem of Duplication and the Layout Solution

The core problem is that multiple HTML pages (`home.page.tmpl`, `about.page.tmpl`) repeat the same boilerplate code (the `<!doctype>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` structure). This is inefficient because any change, like updating a CSS link, would need to be made in every single file.

**The Solution: A Master Layout**

The solution is to create a single master layout file that contains all the common code. This file acts as a parent template.

- A new file, `base.layout.tmpl`, is created in the `/templates` folder.
- The full HTML structure from an existing page is copied into it.

This layout file itself is then defined as a template named "base" using Go's template directives:

**`templates/base.layout.tmpl`**

Go

```Go
{{define "base"}}
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        {{/* ... all the head content ... */}}
    </head>
    <body>
        {{/* ... body content will go here ... */}}
    </body>
    </html>
{{end}}
```

The `{{define "base"}}` at the top and `{{end}}` at the bottom wrap the entire file, giving this layout a name that other templates can refer to.

### Topic 2: Defining Replaceable Content with `{{block}}`

A layout is useless if you can't insert page-specific content into it. This is solved by using the `{{block}}` directive inside the layout file. A block defines a named section that child templates can override.

Three blocks are defined in `base.layout.tmpl`:

1. **`{{block "css" .}}{{end}}`**: Placed in the `<head>` to allow individual pages to add their own custom CSS.
2. **`{{block "content" .}}{{end}}`**: Placed in the `<body>` to hold the main, unique content of each page.
3. **`{{block "js" .}}{{end}}`**: Placed at the end of the `<body>` for page-specific JavaScript.

The `.` within the block directive is important for passing data into the block, which will be relevant later.

**`templates/base.layout.tmpl` (with blocks)**

Go

```Go
{{define "base"}}
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
        {{/* ... */}}
        {{block "css" .}}{{end}}
    </head>
    <body>
        {{block "content" .}}{{end}}
        {{block "js" .}}{{end}}
    </body>
    </html>
{{end}}
```

### Topic 3: Using Layouts in Page Templates with `{{template}}` and `{{define}}`

With the layout and its blocks defined, the individual page templates (`home.page.tmpl`, `about.page.tmpl`) can be simplified dramatically.

Each page template does two things:

1. It declares which layout it wants to use with `{{template "base" .}}`. This tells Go to wrap this page's content in the layout named "base".
2. It provides the content for the blocks defined in the layout, using `{{define "block-name"}}`.

**`templates/home.page.tmpl`**

Go

```Go
{{template "base" .}}

{{define "content"}}
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h1>This is the home page</h1>
                <p>This is some text</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{{end}}
```

This file is now much cleaner. It clearly states it uses the "base" template and only defines the "content" block, leaving all the boilerplate to the layout file.

### Topic 4: The Code Change - Parsing Multiple Files

When the application is run with this new structure, it initially fails. The error message `no such template named "base"` occurs because the rendering function was only parsing the page file (e.g., `home.page.tmpl`) and had no knowledge of the layout file.

The fix is to update the rendering logic to parse **all necessary files** at once.

- The `template.ParseFiles()` function is **variadic**, meaning it can accept one or more filenames as arguments.
- To make it work, you must pass the path to the page template _and_ the path to the layout template.

**`pkg/render/render.go`**

Go

```Go
package render

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "text/template"
)

func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
    // We parse the page template AND the layout template together.
    parsedTemplate, _ := template.ParseFiles("./templates/"+tmpl, "./templates/base.layout.tmpl")
    err := parsedTemplate.Execute(w, nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("error parsing template:", err)
    }
}
```

With this change, Go now knows about both the page and the layout, allowing it to correctly assemble and render the final HTML.

### Topic 5: Identified Inefficiency and The Next Step (Template Cache)

The current `RenderTemplate` function works, but it has a major performance issue: it reads and parses the template files from the disk on **every single request**. Disk access is a slow operation.

**The Identified Problem:** Reading from disk repeatedly is inefficient and will slow down a busy web application.

The Proposed Solution:

To make the application more performant, the goal is to create a template cache. The idea is:

1. When the application first starts, parse all templates and layouts from the disk _once_.
2. Store these pre-parsed, ready-to-use templates in a variable (like a map), which acts as an in-memory cache.
3. On each subsequent request, retrieve the required template directly from the fast in-memory cache instead of reading from the slow disk.

This approach significantly improves performance by doing the "expensive" work of parsing only one time. This will be the focus of the next lecture.
