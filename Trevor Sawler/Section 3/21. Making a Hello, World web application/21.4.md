What does this line do?       
--
n, err := fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
--

This line of code performs two actions at once: writing data to an HTTP response and capturing the outcome of that action.

Let's break it down piece by piece:

1. **`fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")`**
    
    - **`fmt.Fprintf`**: This is a function from Go's standard `fmt` (format) package. The "F" in `Fprintf` stands for "File" and means it writes formatted text to a specific destination, rather than just to the console.
    - **`w`**: This is the destination. In the context of a Go web handler, `w` is the `http.ResponseWriter`. It represents the connection back to the user's web browser.
    - **`"Hello, World!"`**: This is the content that is being written.
    
    So, this part of the line sends the text "Hello, World!" to the user's browser.
    
2. **`n, err :=`**
    
    - The `fmt.Fprintf` function, like many functions in Go, returns two values.
    - **`n`**: The first return value is an integer that holds the **n**umber of bytes that were successfully written.
    - **`err`**: The second return value is an `error`. If the write operation was successful, `err` will be `nil`. If something went wrong (e.g., the user closed their browser mid-response), it will contain an error object with details about the failure.
    - **`:=`**: This is Go's "short variable declaration" operator. It creates the new variables `n` and `err` and assigns the two return values from `fmt.Fprintf` to them in a single step.

**In Plain English:**

Think of it like sending a text message and getting a delivery report back.

- **Action:** `fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")` is you sending the text message "Hello, World!" to a specific contact (`w`).
- **Result:** `n, err :=` is you immediately getting two pieces of information back on your phone's screen:
    - `n`: A confirmation that "13 characters were sent."
    - `err`: A status message that says "No problems" (`nil`) or "Failed to send."
