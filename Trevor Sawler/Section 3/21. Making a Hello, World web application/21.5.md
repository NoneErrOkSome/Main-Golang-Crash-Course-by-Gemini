That's an excellent question that gets to a core rule in the Go programming language.

The underscore `_` (called the **blank identifier**) is used to intentionally **discard a value**.

Hereâ€™s why it's needed in that specific line:

1. **The Function Returns a Value:** The `http.ListenAndServe` function doesn't just start the server; it also returns a value. Specifically, it returns an `error`. This `error` will contain information if the server fails to start (for example, if the port `:8080` is already being used by another application).
    
2. **Go's Strict Compiler Rule:** Go has a strict rule: **every variable that is declared must be used**. If you declare a variable and don't use it anywhere, your program will not compile.
    

**Connecting These Two Points:**

If you were to write the code like this:



```Go
// This creates a variable 'err'
err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) 

// If you don't do anything with 'err' after this, Go will give you an error:
// "err declared but not used"
```

You have to do something with the `err` variable. The proper way to handle it in a real application would be to check it:



```Go
err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Server failed to start:", err)
}
```

However, in the simple example you saw, the programmer decided they didn't want to handle the error. But they still have to acknowledge that the function returns a value.

**The Solution: The Blank Identifier `_`**

The blank identifier `_` acts as a write-only trash can. By writing:



```Go
_ = http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```

You are telling the Go compiler: "I know `http.ListenAndServe` returns an error value, but I am consciously choosing to **ignore it** and throw it away."

This satisfies Go's strict "must use variables" rule without needing to create a variable that you have no intention of using.
