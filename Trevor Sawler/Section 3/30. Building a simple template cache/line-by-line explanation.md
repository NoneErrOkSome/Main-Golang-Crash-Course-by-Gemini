Of course. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code you provided.

---

### `var tc = make(map[string]*template.Template)`

- **`var tc`**: This declares a variable named `tc` (short for "template cache"). Because this line is outside of any function, `tc` is a **package-level variable**. This means it is created only once when the application starts and can be accessed by all functions within the `render` package for the entire lifetime of the program.
- **`= make(map[string]*template.Template)`**: This initializes `tc` to be an empty **map**. A map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
    - The key is a `string` (which will be the template's name, like `"home.page.tmpl"`).
    - The value is a `*template.Template`. This is a **pointer** to a `template.Template` object. This means instead of storing a copy of the large, complex parsed template, we are just storing its memory address, which is very efficient.

### `func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, t string)`

This function is the main entry point for rendering a page. It uses the cache to do so efficiently.

- **`func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, t string)`**: Defines the function named `RenderTemplate`.
    - `w http.ResponseWriter`: The first parameter, `w`, is the "response writer". It represents the connection back to the user's browser. We will write our final HTML to this `w`.
    - `t string`: The second parameter, `t`, is a string containing the name of the template file we want to render (e.g., `"about.page.tmpl"`).
- **`var tmpl *template.Template`**: Declares a local variable `tmpl` that will eventually hold the parsed template we want to execute.
- **`var err error`**: Declares a local variable `err` that will be used to catch any potential errors during the process.
- **`_, inMap := tc[t]`**: This is the core of the cache check. It's a special Go syntax for checking if a key exists in a map.
    - `tc[t]`: It attempts to look up the template name `t` in our cache map `tc`.
    - This lookup returns two values. The first value (assigned to `_`, the blank identifier) would be the template pointer itself. We ignore it because we only care if it exists. The second value (assigned to the boolean variable `inMap`) will be `true` if the key was found, and `false` if it was not.
- **`if !inMap {`**: This condition checks if `inMap` is `false`. This code block only runs if the template was **NOT** found in the cache (a "cache miss").
- **`log.Println("creating template and adding to cache")`**: This prints a message to the server's console log. It's for the developer to see that the slower, "cache creation" path is being taken.
- **`err = createTemplateCache(t)`**: This calls our other function, `createTemplateCache`, to do the hard work of reading the files, parsing them, and adding the result to the cache. The return value (an `error`) is stored in our `err` variable.
- **`if err != nil {`**: This checks if the `createTemplateCache` function returned an error.
- **`log.Println(err)`**: If an error occurred, this line prints the specific error message to the console.
- **`} else {`**: This `else` block runs if the `if !inMap` condition was false, meaning the template **WAS** found in the cache (a "cache hit").
- **`log.Println("using cached template")`**: This prints a message to the console log, letting the developer know that the fast path is being taken.
- **`tmpl = tc[t]`**: This line retrieves the template from the cache. It looks up the key `t` in the map `tc` and assigns the resulting value (the `*template.Template` pointer) to our local `tmpl` variable.
- **`err = tmpl.Execute(w, nil)`**: This is where the page is actually rendered.
    - `tmpl.Execute(...)` calls the `Execute` method on our parsed template.
    - `w`: The first argument tells it to write the generated HTML into the `ResponseWriter`, which sends it to the user's browser.
    - `nil`: The second argument is for any dynamic data you want to pass to the template. We are passing no data here (`nil`).
    - The result of this execution is assigned to `err`.
- **`if err != nil {`**: This checks if an error occurred while executing the template.
- **`log.Println(err)`**: If there was an error, it's printed to the console.

### `func createTemplateCache(t string) error`

This is a helper function whose only job is to create a template and add it to the cache.

- **`func createTemplateCache(t string) error`**: Defines the function. It takes a template name `t` and is declared to return a value of type `error`.
- **`templates := []string{`**: This line declares and initializes a **slice** (a dynamic list) of strings named `templates`.
- **`fmt.Sprintf("./templates/%s", t),`**: This is the first item in the slice. `fmt.Sprintf` formats a string, replacing `%s` with the value of `t`. This builds the full path to the page template file.
- **`"./templates/base.layout.tmpl",`**: This is the second item in the slice, the hardcoded path to the main layout file.
- **`tmpl, err := template.ParseFiles(templates...)`**: This line reads and parses the files.
    - `template.ParseFiles` is the Go function that does the actual work of reading from disk.
    - `templates...`: The `...` unpacks the `templates` slice, so it's like calling `ParseFiles` with each file path as a separate argument.
    - It returns the parsed template (`tmpl`) and a potential error (`err`).
- **`if err != nil {`**: Checks if the parsing failed.
- **`return err`**: If parsing failed, the function stops and returns the error back to the `RenderTemplate` function.
- **`tc[t] = tmpl`**: This is the most important step here. It takes the successfully parsed template object (`tmpl`) and **adds it to our package-level cache map `tc`**.
- **`return nil`**: If everything was successful, the function returns `nil`. In Go, returning a `nil` error signifies success.
