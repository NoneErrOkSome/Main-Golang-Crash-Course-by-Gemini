Based on the information provided, here are the in-depth topics for a dedicated answer:

### Topic 1: The Inefficiency of On-Demand Template Rendering

This section will explore the performance bottleneck associated with reading and parsing template files from the disk for every single HTTP request. It will detail the I/O overhead and the computational cost of parsing, explaining why this method is inefficient, especially for high-traffic websites.

### Topic 2: Introduction to In-Memory Caching for Templates

This topic will introduce the concept of an in-memory cache as a solution to the rendering inefficiency. It will explain the core principle: parse the templates once, store them in a readily accessible data structure in memory (like a map), and reuse the parsed templates for subsequent requests, thereby avoiding repeated disk access.

### Topic 3: Implementing a Simple, On-the-Fly Template Cache

This section will provide a detailed breakdown of the first, simpler implementation approach.

- **The Cache Data Structure:** Explaining the choice of `map[string]*template.Template` as the package-level variable for the cache, detailing why a map is suitable and what its key and value represent.
- **The "Check-Then-Create" Logic:** Detailing the process of checking if a template already exists in the cache using the `_, inMap := tc[t]` idiom. It will cover the two main logical paths: using the cached template if it exists, or creating and adding it to the cache if it does not.
- **Isolating Cache Creation Logic:** Discussing the rationale for creating a separate `createTemplateCache` function. This improves code organization, testability, and readability by separating the logic for parsing files and adding them to the cache from the main rendering flow.

### Topic 4: The Improved Rendering Workflow

This part will walk through the step-by-step execution flow of the new `RenderTemplate` function.

1. A request is received for a specific page (e.g., "home").
2. The function checks the global map (cache) for the "home" key.
3. **First-Time Access:** If the key is not found, it logs a "creating template" message, calls the `createTemplateCache` function, which reads the specific page template and the base layout from disk, parses them, and stores the resulting `*template.Template` object in the cache.
4. **Subsequent Access:** If the key is found, it logs a "using cached template" message and retrieves the pre-parsed `*template.Template` object directly from the map.
5. Finally, it executes the retrieved template to render the HTML and send it to the browser.

### Topic 5: Benefits and Limitations of the Simple Caching Method

This topic will analyze the implemented solution. It will highlight the significant performance improvement achieved by reducing disk I/O. However, it will also point out the primary limitation: the manual maintenance required. As new partials or layouts are added to the project, the developer must remember to manually update the `createTemplateCache` function to include these new files in the parsing process.

### Topic 6: Preview of an Advanced Caching Strategy

This final topic will serve as an introduction to a more complex but robust alternative. It will explain that while the simple approach works well, a more advanced method can automate the discovery and parsing of all templates and partials at application startup. This preemptive caching strategy eliminates the need for manual updates and ensures all templates are ready from the very beginning, offering a more scalable and maintainable long-term solution, which will be explored in a future discussion.
