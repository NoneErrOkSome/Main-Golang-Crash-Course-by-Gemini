A `go.mod` file is now a required element for Go applications1. The "Mod" in `go.mod` is short for "module"2. This file indicates to the Go compiler that the application uses Go modules, the standard library, your own source code, and any external dependencies3.

Key aspects of a `go.mod` file include:

- **Creation** To create the file, run the command `go mod init` followed by a name for your application in the terminal4.
    
- **Contents** A new `go.mod` file will contain the module name you specified and the version of Go you are using5. As you import third-party packages, they will be listed in this file6.
    
- **Importance** It is necessary to run `go mod init` to ensure the application works correctly in subsequent steps7. If you are prompted later to create a `go.mod` file but one already exists, you can skip the step8.
