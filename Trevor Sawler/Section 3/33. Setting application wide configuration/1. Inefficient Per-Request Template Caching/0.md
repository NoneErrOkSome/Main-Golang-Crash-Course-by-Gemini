Of course. We can split "Topic 1" into **three distinct sub-topics**. Each sub-topic focuses on a specific part of the code that contributes to the overall inefficiency, providing a dedicated, in-depth analysis with the relevant code snippets.

### Sub-Topic 1.1: The Trigger - Re-creation on Every Request

This is the starting point of the problem. The inefficiency is triggered every time the `RenderTemplate` function is called because it contains the instruction to rebuild everything from scratch.

**In-Depth Explanation:**

The `RenderTemplate` function in `pkg/render/render.go` is the designated function for rendering any given page. Its fundamental flaw, in this version of the code, is that it does not simply _use_ a template cache; it _creates_ one first. The line `tc, err := CreateTemplateCache()` acts as the trigger for all the inefficient work that follows. Because this function is called for every single HTTP request (e.g., when a user visits `/` or `/about`), the entire expensive process of building the cache is repeated unnecessarily, every single time.

**Relevant Code:**

This snippet from `pkg/render/render.go` shows the trigger point clearly.

Go

```Go
// From: pkg/render/render.go

func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
	// get the template cache from the app config

	tc, err := CreateTemplateCache() // <--- THE TRIGGER: This line is executed on every page view.
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	t, ok := tc[tmpl]
	if !ok {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### Sub-Topic 1.2: The First Inefficiency - Slow Disk I/O with `filepath.Glob`

Once `CreateTemplateCache` is called, the first major performance hit comes from interacting with the filesystem, which is an inherently slow operation.

**In-Depth Explanation:**

Inside the `CreateTemplateCache` function, the program's first task is to find all the necessary template files. It does this using `filepath.Glob`. This function sends a request to the operating system to scan the `./templates/` directory and find all files that match a specific pattern (e.g., `*.page.tmpl`). This is a disk I/O (Input/Output) operation.

Compared to accessing data already in memory (RAM), reading from a disk is orders of magnitude slower. The application is forced to wait for the hard drive to locate and return the list of files. Repeating this slow process for every user request is a major source of latency.

**Relevant Code:**

These lines from the `CreateTemplateCache` function in `pkg/render/render.go` are responsible for the slow disk I/O.

Go

```Go
// From: pkg/render/render.go -> CreateTemplateCache()

func CreateTemplateCache() (map[string]*template.Template, error) {

	myCache := map[string]*template.Template{}

	// INEFFICIENCY 1: This reads from the disk every time.
	pages, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.page.tmpl")
	if err != nil {
		return myCache, err
	}

	for _, page := range pages {
		// ...
		// INEFFICIENCY 1 (Again): This also reads from the disk every time inside the loop.
		matches, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
		if err != nil {
			return myCache, err
		}
        // ...
	}

	return myCache, nil
}
```

### Sub-Topic 1.3: The Second Inefficiency - Repetitive CPU Work with Template Parsing

After the application slowly finds the files on disk, it then has to perform a CPU-intensive task: parsing the content of those files.

**In-Depth Explanation:**

Parsing is the process of reading the raw text content of the template files and converting it into a structured, executable format that Go's `html/template` package can understand and work with. This involves lexical analysis, building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and preparing the template to have data injected into it. This is a complex operation that consumes significant CPU cycles.

The code performs this parsing with `template.New(name).ParseFiles(page)` and `ts.ParseGlob(...)`. Because this happens inside `CreateTemplateCache`, which is triggered on every request, the application is forced to do this heavy lifting over and over again on the exact same file content, even though the templates themselves have not changed.

**Relevant Code:**

These lines from the `CreateTemplateCache` function show the CPU-intensive parsing operations.

Go

```Go
// From: pkg/render/render.go -> CreateTemplateCache()

// ... inside the loop ...
		name := filepath.Base(page)
		// INEFFICIENCY 2: This parses the page template from disk, consuming CPU.
		ts, err := template.New(name).Funcs(functions).ParseFiles(page)
		if err != nil {
			return myCache, err
		}

		matches, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
		// ...

		if len(matches) > 0 {
			// INEFFICIENCY 2 (Again): This parses the layout templates from disk, consuming more CPU.
			ts, err = ts.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
			if err != nil {
				return myCache, err
			}
		}

		myCache[name] = ts
// ...
```
