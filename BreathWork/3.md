### **The Equanimity Practice: A Guide to Rewiring Your Being for Pure Consciousness**

This document outlines a profound breathing and awareness practice designed to open the body's energy channels, expand consciousness, and rewire the brain and entire being for a state of deep equanimity and inner peace. By moving through a powerful energy-building exercise and into a state of deep, receptive stillness, this practice guides you to connect with your source of pure being.

### **Core Philosophy: From Action to Being**

The foundation of this practice is a two-part journey. The first part involves active, dynamic breathing to stimulate and open the physical and energetic systems. This "clearing of the channels" prepares the ground. The second, and most crucial, part is to let everything settle and allow awareness to sink into its most profound state—pure being. This process helps to consciously shift from a state of doing and thinking to one of pure, peaceful awareness, effectively "rewiring" your system for calm, centered presence.

### **The Practice: A Step-by-Step Guide**

This practice is structured into three key phases: **Preparation and Centering**, the dynamic **Energy Breathing Exercise** (performed in three rounds), and the deep **Settling into Pure Being and Integration**.

#### **Phase 1: Preparation and Centering**

Before beginning the active portion, it is vital to arrive fully in the present moment.

1. **Find a Comfortable Position:** Settle into a comfortable seated posture.
2. **Initial Awareness Scan:** Take a few calm, deep breaths. Turn your awareness inward and observe your current state without judgment. Notice the condition of your body and mind. As the guide suggests, practice "smilingly observing and being like, OK. That's how I feel now, and it's all right."
3. **The Principle of Letting Go:** Acknowledge that relaxation is not something to be forced. True relaxation "happens when you stop trying." Let go of any effort to change your state and simply allow yourself to be as you are.

#### **Phase 2: The Energy Breathing Exercise (Three Rounds)**

This is the active phase designed to vigorously move energy and open the pathways of the body and mind.

**The Core Movement and Breath:**

- **Inhalation:** Inhale deeply through the nose. As you inhale, bring your arms up and open your hands wide, expanding your chest.
- **Exhalation:** Exhale forcefully from the belly. As you exhale, pull your hands down and in towards your body.

**The Three Rounds:**

- **First Round:**
    
    1. Begin the dynamic breathing pattern: Inhale up, exhale down. Maintain a strong, steady rhythm.
    2. Focus on the intention to release energy and open all the channels in the body.
    3. Intensify the effort for the **last ten strong breaths**.
    4. On the final breath, take a full, deep inhalation, raising the arms up.
    5. Slowly exhale, bringing the hands down to rest on the knees with palms open.
    6. **Pause and Observe:** Immediately relax your breath. Turn your awareness to the physical sensations: the blood flow, the tingling energy in the hands and arms, the response of your nervous system. Center your awareness and simply feel.
- **Second Round:**
    
    1. When you feel ready, begin the second round with a deep inhalation, bringing the arms up.
    2. Continue the strong, rhythmic breathing ("in, out, in, out"), with the intention of unblocking and releasing energy everywhere.
    3. Complete **five final, powerful breaths**.
    4. Take one last deep inhalation with the arms held high.
    5. Slowly lower the hands on the exhalation, loosening your effort.
    6. **Pause and Expand:** Let your breath flow gently. Broaden your awareness to feel your _entire body_ as a single, vibrant field of energy.
- **Third and Final Round:**
    
    1. Engage in the last round with full power, using it to release more, open more, and strengthen your entire energy system.
    2. Power through the **final ten powerful breaths**.
    3. Take a final, deep inhalation, holding the arms up for a moment to absorb the peak energy.
    4. With a slow exhalation, release the hands down.

#### **Phase 3: Settling into Pure Being and Integration**

This is the most transformative part of the practice. Having stirred the energy, you now allow it to settle into a new, harmonious pattern.

1. **Complete Surrender:** Loosen up and let everything go. Allow your body, mind, breath, and awareness to settle without interference. Give everything complete space, "letting everything happen."
2. **Journey Inward:** Let your awareness travel deep within, centering deeper and deeper into your source—the state of pure being, of pure consciousness.
3. **Allow the Flow:** Feel the cultivated energy flowing through your entire being, continuing to open you up from a place of stillness. With each exhalation, loosen a little more and let your awareness sink even deeper.
4. **Gentle Re-Awakening:**
    - Slowly begin to move your fingers and body, keeping your eyes closed.
    - Rub your hands together vigorously until they are nice and warm.
5. **Grounding in the Heart and Belly:**
    - Place one warm hand on your belly and the other on your heart.
    - Take several nice breaths into these two powerful centers of energy and intuition.
6. **Cultivating Gratitude and Kindness:**
    - Generate a state of thankfulness, completeness, and inner peace.
    - Imagine you are "smiling with the heart" and radiating that light and kindness into every layer of your being.
    - Breathe into this feeling. As the guide instructs: **"Feel it. Breathe it. And be it."**
7. **Third Eye Connection and Self-Massage:**
    - Rub your hands together one more time. Place them together in front of your forehead in a prayer-like position.
    - Cover your closed eyes with your warm palms. Gaze gently into the colorful, dark space in front of you, looking deeper within towards the Third Eye center.
    - Gently massage your eyes, forehead, and temples. Extend this gentle, loving touch over your entire body, giving yourself a nurturing massage.
