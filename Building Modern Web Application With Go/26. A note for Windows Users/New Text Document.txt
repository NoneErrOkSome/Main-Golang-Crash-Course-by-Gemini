A note for Windows Users
Important: Windows Users
In the next few lectures, lecture, I run multiple Go files at the same time on a Macintosh like this:

go run *.go

On Windows, though, this will not work unless you have customized your IDE or terminal. Instead, use this command:

go run .

(note the dot at the end of this command). Note also that you can use the same command, go run ., on Mac and Linux as well.

Thanks to Craig for pointing this out.
