## Values, Variables, and Basic Types in Go üêπ

Understanding values, variables, and the basic data types is fundamental to programming in Go. These concepts form the building blocks for storing and manipulating data in your programs.

---

### Values in Go

A **value** is the most basic piece of data that a program manipulates. Values can be of different types, such as numbers, text (strings), or boolean states (`true` or `false`).

In Go, you can have literal values, which are values written directly in your code.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Examples of literal values
	fmt.Println("Hello, Go!") // "Hello, Go!" is a string literal
	fmt.Println(42)          // 42 is an integer literal
	fmt.Println(3.14159)     // 3.14159 is a floating-point literal
	fmt.Println(true)        // true is a boolean literal
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Hello, Go!
42
3.14159
true
```

Each of these literals has an inherent data type, which Go's compiler infers.

---

### Variables in Go

**Variables** are named storage locations in memory that hold values. Using variables allows you to store data, refer to it by name, and change its value throughout your program (unless it's a constant).

#### Declaring Variables

In Go, variables must be declared before they can be used. A declaration specifies the variable's name and its data type.

1. Using the var keyword:
    
    You can declare a variable and then assign a value to it later, or declare and initialize it in the same step.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	// Declare a variable of type string
    	var greeting string
    	greeting = "Hello, learners!" // Assign a value
    	fmt.Println(greeting)
    
    	// Declare and initialize a variable in one step
    	var age int = 30
    	fmt.Println("Age:", age)
    
    	// Type inference: Go can infer the type if an initializer is present
    	var isLearning = true // Go infers 'isLearning' is of type bool
    	fmt.Println("Is learning Go?", isLearning)
    
    	var pi = 3.14 // Go infers 'pi' is of type float64
    	fmt.Println("Pi approx.:", pi)
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```go
    Hello, learners!
    Age: 30
    Is learning Go? true
    Pi approx.: 3.14
    ```
    
2. Short Variable Declaration (:=):
    
    Inside functions, you can use the := short assignment statement to declare and initialize a variable. The type is inferred from the value on the right-hand side. This is a concise and common way to declare variables in Go.
    
    _Note: `:=` can only be used inside functions, not for package-level variable declarations._
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	// Short variable declaration
    	name := "Go Developer"
    	experienceYears := 2
    
    	fmt.Println("Name:", name)
    	fmt.Println("Experience:", experienceYears, "years")
    
    	// You can re-assign values to variables declared with := using =
    	experienceYears = 3
    	fmt.Println("Updated Experience:", experienceYears, "years")
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```go
    Name: Go Developer
    Experience: 2 years
    Updated Experience: 3 years
    ```
    
3. Declaring Multiple Variables:
    
    You can declare multiple variables at once using the var keyword in a block or on a single line.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	// Multiple variables declared in a block
    	var (
    		courseName    string = "Go Fundamentals"
    		lessonsCount  int    = 50
    		isInteractive bool   = true
    	)
    	fmt.Println("Course:", courseName, "| Lessons:", lessonsCount, "| Interactive:", isInteractive)
    
    	// Multiple variables on one line (type can be omitted if initializers are present)
    	var instructor, platform = "Tech Enthusiast", "Online"
    	fmt.Println("Instructor:", instructor, "| Platform:", platform)
    
    	// Multiple short variable declarations
    	width, height := 1920, 1080
    	fmt.Println("Resolution:", width, "x", height)
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```go
    Course: Go Fundamentals | Lessons: 50 | Interactive: true
    Instructor: Tech Enthusiast | Platform: Online
    Resolution: 1920 x 1080
    ```
    

#### Zero Values

If a variable is declared without an explicit initial value, it is automatically assigned its **zero value**. The zero value depends on the type:

- `0` for numeric types (integers, floats)
- `false` for boolean types
- `""` (an empty string) for string types
- `nil` for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var anInt int
	var aFloat float64
	var aBool bool
	var aString string
	var aPointer *int // Pointer to an integer

	fmt.Printf("Zero int: %d\n", anInt)
	fmt.Printf("Zero float: %f\n", aFloat)
	fmt.Printf("Zero bool: %t\n", aBool)
	fmt.Printf("Zero string: \"%s\"\n", aString)
	fmt.Printf("Zero pointer: %v\n", aPointer)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Zero int: 0
Zero float: 0.000000
Zero bool: false
Zero string: ""
Zero pointer: <nil>
```

#### Variable Naming Conventions

- Variable names should be descriptive and indicate their purpose.
- Go uses **camelCase** for variable names (e.g., `userName`, `httpStatusCode`).
- If a variable name starts with an uppercase letter (e.g., `UserName`), it is **exported**, meaning it's visible and accessible from other packages.
- If it starts with a lowercase letter (e.g., `userName`), it is **unexported** (private to the current package).
- Avoid using overly short variable names (like `x` or `i`) unless their scope is very limited and their purpose is obvious (e.g., loop counters).

#### Scope (A Brief Note)

The **scope** of a variable is the region of code where the variable is accessible. Go has block scope. A variable declared inside a block (e.g., within `{}` of a function or an `if` statement) is only accessible within that block and any nested blocks. Package-level variables are accessible throughout the package.

### Basic Data Types in Go

Go is a statically-typed language, meaning variable types are known at compile time. Here are some of Go's basic data types:

#### Booleans (`bool`)

A boolean type represents a truth value and can be either `true` or `false`.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var isGoFun bool = true
	var isDifficult bool = false

	fmt.Println("Is Go fun?", isGoFun)
	fmt.Println("Is Go difficult?", isDifficult)
	fmt.Println("Is Go fun AND not difficult?", isGoFun && !isDifficult)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Is Go fun? true
Is Go difficult? false
Is Go fun AND not difficult? true
```

#### Numeric Types

Go offers a variety of numeric types to represent integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

1. Integers:
    
    Integers are whole numbers. Go provides both signed (can be positive, negative, or zero) and unsigned (can be positive or zero) integers of various sizes.
    
    - Signed integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
    - Unsigned integers: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
    - `int` and `uint`: These types are platform-dependent, meaning their size (32 or 64 bits) depends on the underlying system architecture. They are generally the most common integer types to use unless you have specific size requirements.
    - `uintptr`: An unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	var smallNum int8 = 127
    	var bigNum int64 = 9223372036854775807
    	var count uint = 100 // Platform-dependent unsigned integer
    
    	fmt.Println("Smallest signed 8-bit int:", smallNum)
    	fmt.Println("Largest signed 64-bit int:", bigNum)
    	fmt.Println("Count:", count)
    
    	// Default integer type for literals is int
    	defaultInt := 12345
    	fmt.Printf("Type of defaultInt: %T\n", defaultInt)
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```go
    Smallest signed 8-bit int: 127
    Largest signed 64-bit int: 9223372036854775807
    Count: 100
    Type of defaultInt: int
    ```
    
2. Floating-Point Numbers:
    
    These represent numbers with a decimal point.
    
    - `float32`: Single-precision floating-point numbers.
    - `float64`: Double-precision floating-point numbers (default for floating-point literals).
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	var gravity float32 = 9.81
    	var precisePi float64 = 3.141592653589793
    
    	fmt.Println("Gravity:", gravity)
    	fmt.Println("Precise Pi:", precisePi)
    
    	// Default float type for literals is float64
    	defaultFloat := 2.71828
    	fmt.Printf("Type of defaultFloat: %T\n", defaultFloat)
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```go
    Gravity: 9.81
    Precise Pi: 3.141592653589793
    Type of defaultFloat: float64
    ```
    
3. Complex Numbers:
    
    Go has built-in support for complex numbers.
    
    - `complex64`: Real and imaginary parts are `float32`.
    - `complex128`: Real and imaginary parts are `float64` (default for complex literals).
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	var c1 complex64 = 5 + 10i
    	c2 := 2.5 + 7.1i // complex128 inferred
    
    	fmt.Println("Complex c1:", c1)
    	fmt.Println("Complex c2:", c2)
    	fmt.Println("c1 + c2 =", c1+complex64(c2)) // Note: explicit conversion needed for different complex types
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```go
    Complex c1: (5+10i)
    Complex c2: (2.5+7.1i)
    c1 + c2 = (7.5+17.1i)
    ```
    

#### Strings (`string`)

A **string** in Go is an immutable sequence of bytes. Strings are typically used to represent text. String literals can be created using double quotes `"` or backticks `` ` ``.

- Double-quoted strings interpret escape sequences (e.g., `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab).
- Backtick-quoted strings are raw string literals; they can span multiple lines and escape sequences are not interpreted.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	standardString := "Hello, Go!\nThis is a new line."
	rawString := `This is a raw string.
It can span multiple lines.
And \n is just a literal \n, not a newline.`

	fmt.Println(standardString)
	fmt.Println("---")
	fmt.Println(rawString)

	// Strings are immutable
	s := "initial"
	// s[0] = 'L' // This would cause a compile-time error
	fmt.Println("String s:", s)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Hello, Go!
This is a new line.
---
This is a raw string.
It can span multiple lines.
And \n is just a literal \n, not a newline.
String s: initial
```

Strings in Go are UTF-8 encoded by default.

#### Type Aliases: `byte` and `rune`

Go provides two important type aliases related to characters and strings:

- **`byte`**: An alias for `uint8`. It typically represents an ASCII character.
- **`rune`**: An alias for `int32`. It represents a Unicode code point (which can be a character from any language). When you iterate over a string with a `for...range` loop, you get runes.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var aByte byte = 'A' // Represents the ASCII value of 'A'
	var aRune rune = '‚ô•' // Represents the Unicode code point for '‚ô•'

	fmt.Printf("Byte '%c' has value: %d\n", aByte, aByte)
	fmt.Printf("Rune '%c' has value: %d\n", aRune, aRune)

	// Iterating over a string gives runes
	str := "Go‚ô•"
	for index, charRune := range str {
		fmt.Printf("Character at index %d is '%c' (rune value %d)\n", index, charRune, charRune)
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Byte 'A' has value: 65
Rune '‚ô•' has value: 9829
Character at index 0 is 'G' (rune value 71)
Character at index 1 is 'o' (rune value 111)
Character at index 2 is '‚ô•' (rune value 9829)
```

### Constants in Go (`const`)

**Constants** are fixed values that cannot be changed after they are declared. They are created using the `const` keyword.

- Constants must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- They can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
- Constants can be **typed** or **untyped**. Untyped constants are more flexible as their type is determined by the context in which they are used, allowing for higher precision in numeric operations until they are assigned or used in a typed context.

Code snippet

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	// Typed constant
	const typedPi float64 = 3.14159265359
	fmt.Println("Typed Pi:", typedPi)

	// Untyped constant (more flexible)
	const untypedPi = 3.14159265358979323846
	fmt.Println("Untyped Pi:", untypedPi)

	// Example of untyped constant flexibility
	const Big = 1 << 100 // A large number
	// fmt.Println(int(Big)) // This would overflow 'int'

	// Use in context determines type
	var needsFloat64 float64 = untypedPi
	var needsInt int = int(untypedPi * 10) // Here untypedPi is used in a float context, then converted

	fmt.Println("Float64 from untyped Pi:", needsFloat64)
	fmt.Println("Int from untyped Pi calculation:", needsInt)

	// Constants can be declared in a block
	const (
		StatusOK       = 200
		StatusNotFound = 404
	)
	fmt.Println("HTTP OK:", StatusOK, "| Not Found:", StatusNotFound)

	// iota can be used to create a sequence of related constants
	const (
		Sunday = iota // 0
		Monday        // 1
		Tuesday       // 2
	)
	fmt.Println("Days:", Sunday, Monday, Tuesday)
}
```

**Output:**

```go
Typed Pi: 3.14159265359
Untyped Pi: 3.141592653589793
Float64 from untyped Pi: 3.141592653589793
Int from untyped Pi calculation: 31
HTTP OK: 200 | Not Found: 404
Days: 0 1 2
```
