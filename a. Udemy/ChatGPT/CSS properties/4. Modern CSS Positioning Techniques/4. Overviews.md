### ðŸ”¸ **4.1 â€“ Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, Sticky (Position Overview)**

- How each `position` type behaves
    
- Use cases for `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`
    
- How `top`, `left`, `z-index`, and `offsets` work
    
- Layering and stacking context side effects

### ðŸ”¸ **4.2 â€“ Layer Management and Stacking with Z-Index**

- How stacking works with `z-index`
    
- How new stacking contexts are formed
    
- Common layering issues (e.g. modals behind overlays)

### ðŸ”¸ **4.3 â€“ Modern Sticky UI Patterns**

- Using `position: sticky` to create anchored headers, navs, and sidebars
