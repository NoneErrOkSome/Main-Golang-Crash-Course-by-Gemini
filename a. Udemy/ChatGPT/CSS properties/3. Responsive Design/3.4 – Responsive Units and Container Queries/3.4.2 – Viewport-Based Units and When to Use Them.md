✅ **3.4.2 – Viewport-Based Units and When to Use Them**

> 🎯 _Master `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax` to build fluid, fullscreen, and adaptive layouts._

## 🧠 What Are Viewport Units?

|Unit|Meaning|Value Example (on 1920×1080 screen)|
|---|---|---|
|`1vw`|1% of the **viewport width**|`19.2px`|
|`1vh`|1% of the **viewport height**|`10.8px`|
|`1vmin`|1% of the **smaller** of `vw` or `vh`|`10.8px` (in this case)|
|`1vmax`|1% of the **larger** of `vw` or `vh`|`19.2px`|

---

## 📐 1. Common Use Cases for `vw` and `vh`

### 🔹 Fullscreen Sections

```css
.hero {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

✅ Takes up full vertical height of the viewport  
❌ On mobile, may overflow due to dynamic browser bars  
✅ Use `height: 100svh` (safe viewport height) on supported browsers

---

### 🔹 Responsive Typography

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 6vw, 3.5rem);
}
```

✅ `vw` allows text to scale based on screen width  
✅ Combine with `clamp()` for boundaries

---

### 🔹 Fluid Padding or Spacing

```css
.section {
  padding: 5vw;
}
```

✅ Padding adapts to screen size, making layout breathable on wide and narrow screens

---

### 🔹 Element Width

```css
.container {
  width: 80vw;
  max-width: 1200px;
}
```

✅ Useful for horizontal scrolling galleries or centered layout width

---

## ⚠️ Mobile Caveats

### ❌ `100vh` may break layouts on mobile due to:

- Address bar shrinking
    
- Keyboard opening
    
- Dynamic viewport sizing
    

### ✅ Safer Alternative (2023+)

```css
/* Use only where supported */
height: 100svh; /* safe visual viewport height */
```

---

## 🧪 Practical Example

```css
.hero {
  height: 100svh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  padding-inline: 5vw;
}

.hero h1 {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 6vw, 4rem);
}
```

✅ Responsive typography  
✅ Full-height section  
✅ Fluid horizontal padding

---

## 🧠 When to Use `vmin` / `vmax`

|Use Case|Unit|
|---|---|
|Square that fills smallest axis|`vmin`|
|Hero font that fills screen width or height|`vmax`|

---

## ✅ Summary

|Unit|Best Use|
|---|---|
|`vw`|Fluid widths, typography, spacing|
|`vh`|Fullscreen sections, height-based layout|
|`svh`|Safe height for mobile fullscreen sections|
|`vmin`|Fit both portrait and landscape orientations|
|`vmax`|Oversized headings or covers|
