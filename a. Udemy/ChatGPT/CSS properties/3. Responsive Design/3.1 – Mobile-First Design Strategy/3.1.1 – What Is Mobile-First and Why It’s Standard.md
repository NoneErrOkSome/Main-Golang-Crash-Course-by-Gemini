‚úÖ **3.1.1 ‚Äì What Is Mobile-First and Why It‚Äôs Standard**

---

### üì± Mobile-First = Design for Small Screens First

- Start with styles for **smallest screens** (mobile)
    
- Add features/layout **progressively** for larger screens
    
- Opposite of the old ‚Äúdesktop-first, then shrink‚Äù mindset
    

---

### üß† Core Principle

> **‚ÄúDesign for the constraints first, then scale up.‚Äù**

- Prioritize:
    
    - Vertical flow
        
    - Thumb-friendly controls
        
    - Readable text
        
    - Minimal layout complexity

|Progressive enhancement|No loss of content/functionality|
|Avoids overrides|No need to undo desktop styles|
|Smaller CSS payload|Less initial styling needed|
|Forces UI prioritization|Forces you to focus on what matters most|

### üîÅ How It Differs From Desktop-First

|Aspect|Mobile-First|Desktop-First|
|---|---|---|
|Base styles|Small screens|Large screens|
|Media queries|`min-width` (scale up)|`max-width` (scale down)|
|Strategy|Progressive enhancement|Graceful degradation|

### ‚úÖ Example: Mobile-First Start

```css
/* Mobile = default */
.card {
  display: block;
  padding: 1rem;
}

/* Enhance for larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    gap: 2rem;
  }
}
```
