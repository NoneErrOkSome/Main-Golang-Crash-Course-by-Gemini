✅ **3.5.1 – Common Responsive Layout Patterns**

> 🎯 _These patterns form the core structure of almost every modern website or app layout. Mastering them means you can build almost any UI that adapts smoothly to screen size._

---

## 🧱 Pattern 1: **Stacked → Side-by-Side (Cards, Forms, Lists)**

### 📱 Mobile:

- Cards, list items, or form fields stack **vertically**
    
- Easier to read and tap with thumbs
    
- Often `display: block` or `flex-direction: column`
    

### 💻 Desktop:

- Elements are placed **side-by-side**
    
- Uses `flex-direction: row`, `grid`, or even `inline-flex`
    
- Adds spacing with `gap`, `margin`, or `grid-column-gap`
    

### 🔍 Examples:

- Product cards in a shop
    
- Contact form with labels/inputs inline
    
- Feature list icons + text in columns
    

### ✅ Technique:

- Use **mobile-first** layout as base
    
- Then apply `@media (min-width: …)` to adjust layout

## 🧱 Pattern 2: **Auto-Adaptive Grid with `auto-fit` + `minmax()`**

### 💡 Idea:

Automatically place items in a fluid grid, where each card resizes **based on available space**, not hard breakpoints.

### 💬 Use Case:

- Photo galleries
    
- Card-based dashboards
    
- Responsive pricing tables
    

### ✅ Why It Works:

- `auto-fit` fills as much space as possible
    
- `minmax(250px, 1fr)` ensures that cards never shrink below 250px
    

### 🧠 Benefits:

- No breakpoints needed
    
- Layout adjusts across any width (even between breakpoints)

## 🧱 Pattern 3: **Responsive Nav: Burger → Inline Horizontal**

### 📱 On Mobile:

- Navigation is stacked or hidden in a "hamburger" menu
    
- Toggled open via JS or checkbox hack
    
- Uses `flex-direction: column`
    

### 💻 On Desktop:

- Inline layout with spacing (`gap`)
    
- Horizontally laid out across a `flex` container
    
- Often visible by default
    

### ✅ Responsive Trigger:

- Usually switches around `768px–960px` screen width
    

### 🔧 Best Practices:

- Use `display: none` / `display: flex` toggle
    
- Avoid positioning nightmares by using container `padding` and `z-index` hierarchy

## 🧱 Pattern 4: **Responsive Hero Section with Fluid Text + Centered CTA**

### 📱 Mobile:

- Text is centered and vertically stacked
    
- Font is smaller and CTA fills width
    

### 💻 Desktop:

- Larger typography using `clamp()`
    
- CTA may align side-by-side with image or float to a corner
    
- Background image may change or reposition
    

### ✅ Tools:

- `min-height: 100svh` or `100vh`
    
- `place-items: center` in grid
    
- Use `clamp()` to size heading responsively
    

---

## 🧱 Pattern 5: **Sticky Header or Footer**

### 📱 Mobile:

- Sticky headers help keep navigation in view
    
- Sticky footers anchor important actions (e.g. checkout button)
    

### 💻 Desktop:

- Stays sticky but often shrinks or becomes transparent
    
- Sometimes switches behavior (e.g. pinned only after scroll)
    

### ✅ Tools:

- `position: sticky; top: 0`
    
- Combine with `z-index`, `box-shadow`, and `backdrop-filter`
    
- Optional scroll listeners for advanced behavior

## 🧱 Pattern 6: **Split Layout: Sidebar + Main Content**

### 📱 Mobile:

- Sidebar becomes a toggleable drawer
    
- Main content takes full width
    
- Often hidden via `display: none` until toggled
    

### 💻 Desktop:

- Two-column layout using:
    
    - `grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr`
        
    - or `flex-direction: row`
        

### ✅ Considerations:

- Keep sidebar scrollable using `overflow-y: auto`
    
- Use `position: sticky` to lock it during scroll
    
- Be mindful of accessibility for toggling sidebars
    

---

## 🧱 Pattern 7: **Sticky-to-Static Component Transitions**

### Use Case:

- Filter panel, chat sidebar, table of contents
    
- Stays sticky on short screens, switches to static or collapses on small mobile
    

### ✅ Strategy:

- Use `position: sticky` with `@media` toggle
    
- On very small screens, disable sticky and collapse into accordion
