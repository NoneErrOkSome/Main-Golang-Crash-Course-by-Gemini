âœ… **3.3 â€“ Breakpoint Strategy and Layout Adjustments** can be broken down into **5 in-depth parts** to give you full control over how to scale and adapt your layout at different screen widths.

### ðŸ”¸ **3.3.1 â€“ Layout Shifts and Logical Breakpoints**

- Identify when layout needs to change (e.g. stacking â†’ row layout)
    
- Avoid device-based breakpoints (iPhone X, iPad Pro)
    
- Define breakpoints based on **content behavior**, not screen brand
    
- Set breakpoints only when necessary
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **3.3.2 â€“ Adjusting Flexbox and Grid at Breakpoints**

- Change `flex-direction` from `column` to `row`
    
- Switch from single-column grid to multi-column grid
    
- Use `gap`, `align-items`, `justify-content` for layout control
    
- Create split layouts (sidebar + main)
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **3.3.3 â€“ Responsive Spacing: Padding, Margin, and Gap**

- Adjust spacing (`padding`, `margin`, `gap`) at each breakpoint
    
- Use `clamp()` and `min()`/`max()` to create fluid spacing
    
- Scale whitespace proportionally to screen size
    
- Replace media queries with fluid spacing where possible

### ðŸ”¸ **3.3.4 â€“ Fluid Typography and Responsive Type Scaling**

- Use `clamp()` to scale font-size between min and max
    
- Use `rem` instead of `px` for scalable text
    
- Match line-height and spacing with responsive typography
    
- Define typography breakpoints independently from layout breakpoints
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **3.3.5 â€“ Adaptive Layout Components (Cards, Forms, Navbars)**

- Cards: stack on mobile, align in grid on desktop
    
- Forms: switch between stacked inputs and grid layout
    
- Navbars: collapse to hamburger, expand to horizontal
    
- Adjust button sizes and icon positions by screen width
