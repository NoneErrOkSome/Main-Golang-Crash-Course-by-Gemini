âœ… ðŸŸ¢ **PART 1.2: `box-sizing` and Universal Defaults** can be clearly and thoroughly covered in **3 focused subparts**:

## ðŸ”¹ **1.2.1 â€“ Understanding `box-sizing` Behavior**

- What is `box-sizing`?
    
- `content-box` (default) vs `border-box`
    
- Real layout differences and practical side-by-side demos
    
- Why `border-box` is the modern layout standard
    
- Use cases where `content-box` may still appear (rarely)

## ðŸ”¹ **1.2.2 â€“ The Universal Selector Reset**

- Why you should apply `box-sizing` universally
    
- The full rule:
    
    ```css
    *, *::before, *::after {
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```
    
- Why we include `::before` and `::after`
    
- Impact on third-party components, plugins, and layout libraries
    
- Best placement: global reset file or `:root` stylesheet

## ðŸ”¹ **1.2.3 â€“ Real-World Base Styles (Mobile-First Defaults)**

- Combining universal `box-sizing` with:
    
    - `margin: 0`, `padding: 0` resets
        
    - `font-family`, `line-height`, `height: 100%`, etc.
        
- Creating a clean, layout-safe CSS foundation
    
- When and how to use `normalize.css` or custom reset
