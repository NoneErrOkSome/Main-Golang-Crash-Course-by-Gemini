## 📦 Breakdown of PART 1.6

### 🔸 **1.6.1 – Best Practices for Box Sizing in Real Projects**

- When to use `box-sizing: border-box` (💯 almost always)
    
- Use padding for internal layout → not spacing between elements
    
- Prefer logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`)
    
- Use consistent units across spacing: `rem` + `clamp()`
    
- Base spacing system: e.g. `--spacing: 1rem`, `--gap: 2rem`
    
- Avoid mixing `width` + `padding` + `border` + `margin` randomly
    
- Build “sizing-safe” components for reuse (e.g. cards, buttons)

### 🔸 **1.6.2 – Debugging Box Model & Layout Issues**

- How to use DevTools box model inspector
    
- Common issues and quick fixes:
    
    - Content overflowing box → check `box-sizing` or `padding`
        
    - Element pushed out of parent → check `margin`, `position`, `width`
        
    - Double space between elements → **margin collapsing**
        
- Outline vs border (for debugging):
    
    ```css
    * { outline: 1px solid red; }
    ```
    
- Use `overflow: hidden` only when you're sure you want to clip
    
- Browser inconsistencies: test on mobile/desktop scroll
