Awesome! Welcome to âœ… **ðŸŸ¢ PART 1.4 â€“ Widths & Heights (with Units)**  
This is where we unlock the true **flexibility of layout sizing** in CSS â€” using modern, responsive units and functions.

## ðŸ“¦ What Weâ€™ll Cover in 1.4

We'll break this into **4 key subparts**:

---

### ðŸ”¸ **1.4.1 â€“ Absolute Units vs Relative Units**

- `px`, `cm`, `mm` âžœ **absolute units** (fixed sizes)
    
- `em`, `rem`, `%` âžœ **relative units** (scale based on context)
    
- Viewport units: `vw`, `vh`, `svw`, `lvh` (responsive to screen size)
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **1.4.2 â€“ Content-Aware Sizing**

- `min-content`, `max-content`, `fit-content()`
    
- Adaptive to child content size
    
- Used in Grid, Flexbox, and component design
    
- Smart truncation or expansion of content boxes
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **1.4.3 â€“ Fluid Sizing with `clamp()`**

- Combine **min**, **preferred**, and **max** in one function
    
- Perfect for responsive font sizes or container widths
    
- Formula: `clamp(min, preferred, max)`
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **1.4.4 â€“ Modern Responsive Strategy (Mobile-First)**

- Use `%`, `vw`, `fr`, `clamp()` for containers
    
- Combine with `max-width`, `min-height`, etc.
    
- Component example: responsive card grid
    
- Avoid `100vw` pitfalls (scrollbars!) â€” use `width: 100%` instead
