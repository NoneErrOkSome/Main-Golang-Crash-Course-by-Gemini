âœ… **2.2 â€“ Display** is all about how elements **behave in the layout flow** â€” do they stack vertically, line up horizontally, disappear, or flatten?

To cover everything with clarity and practical depth, we can break it down into **5 focused topics**:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Breakdown of **2.2 â€“ Display: block, inline, inline-block, none, contents**

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.2.1 â€“ `display: block`**

- Stacks vertically
    
- Takes full width by default
    
- Starts on a new line
    
- Default for elements like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<p>`
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.2.2 â€“ `display: inline`**

- Flows within text
    
- Respects only `horizontal` properties (`margin-left`, `padding-right`)
    
- Ignores width/height
    
- Default for `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.2.3 â€“ `display: inline-block`**

- Mixes `inline` and `block` behaviors
    
- Respects width and height
    
- Stays inline with text
    
- Use for buttons, badges, nav links
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.2.4 â€“ `display: none`**

- **Completely removes** the element from rendering
    
- No space reserved
    
- Useful for toggling UI states
    
- Difference from `visibility: hidden`
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.2.5 â€“ `display: contents` (Modern Flattening)**

- Removes the elementâ€™s **box**, but **keeps its children** in layout
    
- Great for removing extra wrapper `<div>`s
    
- Does not work with some elements like `<table>` rows
    
- Still affects inheritance and accessibility
