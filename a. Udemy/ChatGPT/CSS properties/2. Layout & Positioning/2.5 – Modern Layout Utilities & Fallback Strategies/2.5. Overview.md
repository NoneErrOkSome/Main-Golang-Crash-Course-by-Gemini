## ðŸ“¦ Breakdown of 2.5 â€“ Modern Layout Utilities & Fallback Strategies

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.5.1 â€“ Why Float-Based Layouts Are Obsolete**

- Brief historical context of float-based layout
    
- The problems: clearfix hacks, collapsed parents, limited control
    
- When (and only when) `float` is still appropriate (e.g. text wrap)
    
- Quick "then vs now" layout comparison table

### ðŸ”¸ **2.5.2 â€“ Modern Layout Replacements for Float Use Cases**

|Old Float Use Case|Modern Replacement|
|---|---|
|2-column layout|`display: flex;`|
|Grid of cards|`display: grid;`|
|Sticky sidebar|`grid` + `position: sticky`|
|Text wrap around image|âœ… `float: left/right` (still valid)|

- Additional demos:
    

- Side-by-side layouts using Flexbox
    
- Responsive card grids using Grid + `auto-fit` + `minmax`
    
- Utility class snippets for common layout patterns

### ðŸ”¸ **2.5.3 â€“ Fallback Strategies for Layout Resilience**

- When to provide a fallback for `grid` (very rare)
    
- `display: block` fallback for non-supporting browsers
    
- `@supports` rule for feature queries:
    

```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  .layout { display: grid; }
}
```

- Using Flexbox as a backup if Grid is unavailable
    
- Progressive enhancement: start mobile-first, then build up
