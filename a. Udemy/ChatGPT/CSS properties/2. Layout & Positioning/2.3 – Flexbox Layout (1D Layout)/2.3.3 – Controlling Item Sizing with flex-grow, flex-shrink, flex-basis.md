Let’s continue with ✅ **2.3.3 – Controlling Item Sizing with `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`** — the heart of **responsive layouts** in Flexbox.

This is where you learn how to **expand**, **shrink**, or **fix the size** of elements within a flex container.

## 🔧 The `flex` Shorthand

```css
flex: grow shrink basis;
```

It’s shorthand for:

```css
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0;
```

✅ You can also write:

```css
flex: 1; /* Equivalent to flex: 1 1 0 */
```

---

## 🔹 `flex-grow`: “Take More Space if Available”

- Value is **relative** to siblings
    
- `0` = don’t grow
    
- `1+` = grow based on ratio
    

### Example:

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

➡️ All items with `flex-grow: 1` share available space equally  
➡️ If one has `flex-grow: 2`, it takes twice as much

---

## 🔹 `flex-shrink`: “Shrink if Not Enough Space”

- Value is **relative**
    
- `0` = never shrink
    
- `1` = shrink if needed
    
- Useful when content should **not compress** (e.g., logos, icons)
    

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

---

## 🔹 `flex-basis`: “Start With This Size”

- Sets the **initial main-size** before grow/shrink
    
- Acts like `width` or `height` depending on flex direction
    
- Can be `auto`, `px`, `%`, `content`
    

```css
.item {
  flex-basis: 200px;
}
```

## 📦 Practical Example

### ✅ HTML

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="item grow1">Grow 1</div>
  <div class="item grow2">Grow 2</div>
</div>
```

### ✅ CSS

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.grow1 {
  flex: 1; /* flex: 1 1 0 */
  background: #0d6efd;
}

.grow2 {
  flex: 2; /* flex: 2 1 0 */
  background: #ffc107;
}

.item {
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### 📐 Result:

- `.grow1` takes 1 portion of the available space
    
- `.grow2` takes 2 portions — it’s **twice as wide** as `.grow1`

## ✅ When to Use Each

|Property|Use Case Example|
|---|---|
|`flex-grow: 1`|Let card stretch across extra space|
|`flex-shrink: 0`|Prevent icon/logo from shrinking|
|`flex-basis: 200px`|Default size before growing/shrinking|

---

## 🔁 Helpful Shortcuts

|Shorthand|Expands?|Shrinks?|Size?|
|---|---|---|---|
|`flex: 1`|✅ Grow|✅ Shrink|`0` basis|
|`flex: 0 1 auto`|❌ Grow|✅ Shrink|Natural|
|`flex: 0 0 auto`|❌ Grow|❌ Shrink|Natural|
|`flex: none`|❌ Grow|❌ Shrink|Natural|
|`flex: auto`|✅ Grow|✅ Shrink|auto basis|
