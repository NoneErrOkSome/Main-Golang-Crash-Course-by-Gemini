✅ **2.6.1 – Understanding `z-index` Basics**

---

### 🧠 What `z-index` Does

- Controls **stacking order** of overlapping elements along the Z-axis (front-to-back)
    
- Only works on **positioned** elements:
    
    ```css
    position: relative | absolute | fixed | sticky
    ```
    
- Higher `z-index` = appears in front

### ✅ Basic Example

```html
<div class="box box1">Box 1</div>
<div class="box box2">Box 2</div>
```

```css
.box {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  color: white;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.box1 {
  background: #0d6efd;
  z-index: 1;
}

.box2 {
  background: crimson;
  margin-top: -100px;
  z-index: 2;
}
```

✅ `.box2` appears in front of `.box1` because its `z-index` is higher.

### 🔢 Value Types

|Value|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`auto`|Uses parent stacking context order|
|`0`|Baseline stacking|
|`>0`|Renders on top of lower values|
|`<0`|Renders behind baseline layers|

---

### ⚠️ `z-index` Only Works With Position

```css
/* ❌ Doesn't work */
z-index: 10;

/* ✅ Works only with: */
position: relative | absolute | fixed | sticky;
```
