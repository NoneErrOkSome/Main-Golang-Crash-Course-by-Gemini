âœ… **2.6 â€“ Z-Index and Stacking Contexts** can be fully covered in **3 focused parts**:

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.6.1 â€“ Understanding `z-index` Basics**

- What `z-index` does
    
- Default stacking behavior without `z-index`
    
- Positive, negative, and auto values
    
- Positioning requirement (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`)
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.6.2 â€“ Stacking Contexts Explained**

- What creates a new stacking context:
    
    - Positioned elements with `z-index`
        
    - `opacity < 1`
        
    - `transform`, `filter`, `perspective`, `will-change`
        
- How nested contexts prevent elements from overlapping across boundaries
    
- Visualizing isolated stacking layers
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2.6.3 â€“ Common `z-index` Problems and Fixes**

- Why higher `z-index` doesn't work sometimes
    
- Debugging with DevTools layers panel
    
- Fixing dropdowns behind modals
    
- Best practices:
    
    - Keep z-index ranges scoped (e.g., 10, 100, 1000)
        
    - Use consistent layers (e.g., base, nav, modal, overlay)
