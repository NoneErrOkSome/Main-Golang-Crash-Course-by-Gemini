Of course. Let's elaborate on Chapter 6, the final system verification test. This chapter is arguably the most important, as it confirms that all the individual components you've installed can work together in a typical development workflow.

### **Chapter 6 Elaborated: The System Verification Test**

#### **The Purpose of This Test**

This is an **end-to-end test**. Its goal is to simulate a complete, albeit simple, development cycle:

1. **Write Code:** You will use VS Code to write a server application.
    
2. **Run Code:** You will use the Terminal and Node.js to execute your application.
    
3. **Test the Application:** You will use Postman to act as a client and interact with your running server.
    
4. **Analyze the Network:** You will use Wireshark to observe the underlying network communication between your client (Postman) and your server (Node.js).
    

If this test succeeds, it proves that your environment is correctly configured for writing, running, and debugging network-based applications, which is the core of the course.

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

##### **Step 1: Setting Up the Project Files**

First, we need to create a clean workspace and the necessary files. We'll do this from the terminal.

1. Open your terminal (iTerm2).
    
2. Navigate to your Desktop and create a new folder for this test project. This keeps your desktop tidy.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd ~/Desktop
    mkdir node-test
    cd node-test
    ```
    
3. Inside this new `node-test` directory, create two empty files: one for our server code (`app.js`) and one to hold the data our server will provide (`text.txt`).
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    touch app.js
    touch text.txt
    ```
    
4. Now, let's open this entire folder in VS Code using the `code` shell command you installed earlier.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    code .
    ```
    
5. In the VS Code window that appears, click on `text.txt` in the file explorer on the left. Type the following message into the file and save it (`Cmd + S`):
    
    ```
    This text is coming from node.
    ```
    

##### **Step 2: Writing the Node.js Server Code**

Now, click on the `app.js` file in VS Code. This is where we'll write the logic for our server. Copy and paste the following code. The comments explain what each part does.

JavaScript

```
// 1. Import necessary Node.js modules
// 'http' module is for creating HTTP servers and requests.
const http = require('http'); 
// 'fs' (File System) module is for interacting with files on your computer.
// 'node:fs' is the modern way to specify you're using a built-in Node module.
const fs = require('node:fs'); 

// 2. Create the HTTP server object
// The http.createServer() method takes a function that will run every single time
// a request hits the server. This function receives two objects: 'req' (the request)
// and 'res' (the response).
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  
  console.log('Request received!'); // Log to the terminal to see it working

  // 3. Read the file from the hard disk
  // We use readFileSync to read the contents of 'text.txt'. 'Sync' means the
  // code will wait here until the file is fully read before moving on.
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync('./text.txt');
  
  // 4. Set the response headers
  // Headers give the client (the browser or Postman) extra information.
  // 'Content-Type' tells the client what kind of data we're sending.
  // 'text/plain' means we're just sending simple, unformatted text.
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

  // 5. Send the file content back to the client and end the response
  // res.end() sends the data and signals that the communication is complete.
  res.end(fileContent);
});

// 6. Start the server and make it listen for connections
const port = 4080;
// 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address called 'localhost' or 'loopback'. 
// It always means "this same machine".
const ipAddress = '127.0.0.1'; 

// The .listen() method tells the server to start listening for requests on the
// specified IP address and port.
server.listen(port, ipAddress, () => {
  console.log(`Server has started and is listening on http://${ipAddress}:${port}`);
});
```

Save this file (`Cmd + S`).

##### **Step 3: Preparing the Monitoring and Testing Tools**

1. **Start Wireshark:**
    
    - Open the Wireshark application.
        
    - In the list of network interfaces, find the one named **Loopback: lo0**. This is the virtual network interface your computer uses to talk to itself.
        
    - Double-click on `Loopback: lo0` to start capturing packets. You may see some initial traffic, which you can ignore.
        
2. **Open Postman:**
    
    - Open the Postman application. You should have a blank request tab open.
        

##### **Step 4: Running the Server**

Go back to your terminal, which should still be in the `~/Desktop/node-test` directory.

1. Run your application using Node.js:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    node app.js
    ```
    
2. You should see the following message appear and the terminal will seem to "hang" (it won't return you to a new prompt). This is correct! It means your server is running and actively listening for requests.
    
    ```
    Server has started and is listening on http://127.0.0.1:4080
    ```
    

##### **Step 5: Testing with Postman**

Now, let's act as a client and send a request to our running server.

1. Switch to Postman.
    
2. Ensure the request method is set to `GET`.
    
3. In the URL bar, type the address that your server is listening on: `http://127.0.0.1:4080`.
    
4. Click the blue **Send** button.

#### **What Success Looks Like: Verifying the Results**

This is the final verification. Check each component to see the results.

- **In your Terminal:**
    
    - You should see the new log message `Request received!`. This proves your server's code was triggered by Postman's request.
        
- **In Postman:**
    
    - In the bottom half of the window (the "Response" section), you should see the body of the response, which is the text from your file:
        
        ```
        This text is coming from node.
        ```
        
    - You should also see a green `Status: 200 OK`, which is the standard HTTP code for a successful request.
        
- **In Wireshark:**
    
    - The packet capture window, which was mostly quiet, will now show a flurry of new packets.
        
    - To make it easier to see, type `http` into the "Apply a display filter" bar at the top and press Enter.
        
    - You will see a packet with information like `GET / HTTP/1.1`. This is Postman's request to your server.
        
    - You will see another packet right after it, likely labeled `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. This is your server's response. If you click on this packet, you can look through the details in the pane below and you will find the actual data: `This text is coming from node.`. This proves that the data was actually sent over the (virtual) network.
        

If you have successfully observed all of these outcomes, your machine is perfectly set up and ready for the course. Congratulations!
