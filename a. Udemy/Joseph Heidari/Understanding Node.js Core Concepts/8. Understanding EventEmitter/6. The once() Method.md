Of course, here is the in-depth document on the `once()` method.

## The `once()` Method

The `EventEmitter` class provides the `.once()` method for situations where you need a listener to react to an event only a single time. It registers a disposable, "single-use" listener that is automatically removed after it has been executed.

### Core Behavior: Listen Once, Then Deregister

Unlike the `.on()` method which creates a persistent listener, `.once()` creates a temporary one. This listener will be invoked only the **very first time** its corresponding event is emitted. After that single execution, the `EventEmitter` automatically removes the listener. Any subsequent emissions of that same event will not trigger it again.

This is particularly useful for initialization tasks or setup actions that should only ever happen once in an application's lifecycle, such as connecting to a database.

### Practical Example

The provided `app.js` file perfectly demonstrates this behavior with the `"bar"` event.

**`app.js`**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// A listener is registered using .once()
myE.once("bar", () => {
  console.log("An event occurred bar.");
});

// The "bar" event is emitted multiple times
myE.emit("bar");
myE.emit("bar");
myE.emit("bar");
```

**Execution Flow and Output:**

1. The first `myE.emit("bar")` call finds the listener, executes it, and prints `"An event occurred bar."` to the console.
    
2. Immediately after execution, the `EventEmitter` removes this listener from its internal registry for the `"bar"` event.
    
3. All subsequent `myE.emit("bar")` calls find no registered listeners for the `"bar"` event and therefore do nothing.
    

The final output in the console will be just a single line, proving the listener only ran once.

### How It Works Internally

The `.once()` method works by creating a special **wrapper function** around your original listener. When the event is emitted, this wrapper function is called, which does two things in order:

1. It executes your original listener function.
    
2. It then immediately calls the internal `removeListener()` method to remove _itself_ from the event's listener array.
    

This "execute-then-remove" logic, handled by the wrapper, is what guarantees the single-use behavior.
