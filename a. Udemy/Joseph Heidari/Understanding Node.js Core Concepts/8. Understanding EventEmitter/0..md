Based on the video transcript, the content can be split into **8 distinct topics**. For each of these, a dedicated and detailed answer can be generated.

Here are the topics:

1. **A Basic "Hello, EventEmitter" Example:** An introduction showing the fundamental code structure: requiring the `events` module, creating a class that extends `EventEmitter`, and using the `.on()` and `.emit()` methods.
    
2. **The EventEmitter as a JavaScript Design Pattern:** A crucial clarification that `EventEmitter` is a pure JavaScript implementation of the Observer pattern and is completely separate from the low-level, C++-based Event Loop and asynchronous I/O system (Libuv).
    
3. **Understanding the Event-Driven Model:** An explanation of the "event-driven" paradigm using an analogy of an operating system handling keyboard input asynchronously (via interrupts/events) versus synchronously (via constant polling).
    
4. **How EventEmitter Works Internally:** A conceptual breakdown of the internal mechanics, explaining that an `EventEmitter` instance maintains an object where event names are keys and the values are arrays of listener functions.
    
5. **Working with Multiple Listeners and Arguments:** A practical demonstration of how to register multiple listeners for the same event, how they are executed in order, and how to pass data from the `.emit()` method to the listener functions.
    
6. **The `once()` Method:** A focused explanation of the `once()` method, contrasting it with `.on()` by demonstrating how it registers a listener that is automatically removed after it has been triggered a single time.
    
7. **Deconstructing EventEmitter with a Custom Implementation:** A practical proof that `EventEmitter` is pure JavaScript by replacing the built-in module with a custom, from-scratch implementation and showing that the code still works as expected.
    
8. **Exploring the Official Documentation and Source Code:** A tour of the official Node.js documentation for the `events` module and a brief look at the actual `events.js` source code on GitHub.
