Of course, here is the in-depth document explaining how the `EventEmitter` works internally.

## How EventEmitter Works Internally

The `EventEmitter` is not magic; it's a straightforward and elegant JavaScript pattern. At its core, an `EventEmitter` instance manages a simple data structureâ€”an object that acts as a registry for events and their corresponding listener functions.

---

### The Listener Object

Every instance of an `EventEmitter` contains a "listener object" (or hash map). This object's purpose is to store all the listener functions that have been registered.

- The **keys** of this object are the event names (e.g., `"foo"`, `"bar"`).
    
- The **value** for each key is an **array** that holds all the listener functions registered for that specific event.

### The `.on()` Method: Registering a Listener

When you call the `.on(eventName, listenerFn)` method, a simple two-step process occurs internally:

1. The `EventEmitter` looks inside its listener object for a key that matches the `eventName`.
    
2. If a key for that event doesn't exist, it first creates it and sets its value to an empty array.
    
3. It then **pushes** the `listenerFn` into the array associated with that event name.
    

**Visual Example:**

After running the following code from `app.js`:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
myE.on("foo", () => { /* function A */ });
myE.on("foo", () => { /* function B */ });
myE.once("bar", () => { /* function C */ });
```

The internal `listeners` object would look like this:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
{
  "foo": [ functionA, functionB ],
  "bar": [ functionC ]
}
```

### The `.emit()` Method: Triggering Listeners

When you call the `.emit(eventName, ...args)` method, the `EventEmitter` performs the following actions:

1. It looks inside its listener object for the key matching the `eventName`.
    
2. If it doesn't find a matching key, it does nothing and returns.
    
3. If it finds the key, it retrieves the associated array of listener functions.
    
4. It then **loops through** this array and **executes each function**, one by one, in the order they were registered.
    
5. Any additional arguments passed to `.emit()` are passed along to each listener function it calls.
    

This simple mechanism of storing functions in an array and iterating through them upon emission is the entire "magic" behind the `EventEmitter`.
