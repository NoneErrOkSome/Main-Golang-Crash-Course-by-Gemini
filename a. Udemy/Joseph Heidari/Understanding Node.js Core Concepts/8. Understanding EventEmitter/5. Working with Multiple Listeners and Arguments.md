Of course, here is the in-depth document on working with multiple listeners and arguments.

## Working with Multiple Listeners and Arguments

The `EventEmitter` is designed to be flexible, allowing you to register multiple listeners for a single event and pass data from the emitter to those listeners.

---

### Registering Multiple Listeners

You are not limited to a single listener per event. By calling `.on()` multiple times for the same event name, you can register several listener functions.

Execution Order:

When the event is emitted, the EventEmitter will execute all registered listeners for that event synchronously, in the order they were added.

`app.js`

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Registering the first listener for "foo"
myE.on("foo", () => {
  console.log("An event occurred 1.");
});

// Registering a second listener for the same "foo" event
myE.on("foo", () => {
  console.log("An event occurred 2.");
});
```

When `myE.emit("foo")` is called, `"An event occurred 1."` will always be logged before `"An event occurred 2."` because it was registered first.

---

### Passing Arguments to Listeners

You can pass data to your listener functions by providing additional arguments to the `.emit()` method. Any arguments passed after the event name will be forwarded directly to each listener function.

`app.js`

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// This listener is designed to accept one argument, `x`.
myE.on("foo", (x) => {
  console.log("An event with a parameter occurred:");
  console.log(x);
});
```

#### **Putting It All Together**

Let's look at the combined effect. Consider all three listeners for the `"foo"` event from the provided `app.js` file and a single emit call:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Emitting the "foo" event with one argument
myE.emit("foo", "some text");
```

**Execution Flow and Output:**

1. The first listener `() => console.log("An event occurred 1.")` runs. It doesn't use the argument, but it is called.
    
2. The second listener `() => console.log("An event occurred 2.")` runs next.
    
3. The third listener `(x) => ...` runs last. The string `"some text"` is passed into its parameter `x`.
    

The final console output will be:

```JavaScript
An event occurred 1.
An event occurred 2.
An event with a parameter occurred:
some text
```

If you were to emit the event with no arguments (`myE.emit("foo")`), the first two listeners would run as normal, but the third listener would execute with `x` being `undefined`.
