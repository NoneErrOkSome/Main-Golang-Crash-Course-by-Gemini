Of course. Here is the document for "Navigating the File System."

## Navigating the File System

This document covers the essential commands for moving around your computer's file system using the command line.

---

### Finding Your Current Location: `pwd`

The **`pwd`** command, which stands for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory, tells you exactly where you are in the file system. Running it will display the full path of your current folder.

Bash

```
pwd
```

**Output:** `/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/testing`

---

### Changing Directories: `cd`

The **`cd`** command, short for **c**hange **d**irectory, is used to move into a different folder. You simply provide the name of the directory you want to enter.

Bash

```
cd testing
```

You can use the **Tab key** to autocomplete folder and file names, which saves time and prevents typos.

### Special Directory Shortcuts

There are two important shortcuts you will use constantly when navigating:

- **`~` (Tilde):** Represents your **home directory**. No matter where you are, running `cd ~` or just `cd` by itself will instantly take you back to your home folder (e.g., `/Users/YourUsername`).
    
- **`..` (Double Dot):** Represents the **parent directory**, or the folder one level up from your current location. To move up a level, you use:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd ..
    ```
