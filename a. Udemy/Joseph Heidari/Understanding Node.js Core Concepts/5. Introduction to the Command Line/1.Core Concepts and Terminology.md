Of course. Here is a brief document explaining the core concepts and terminology from the video.

### **Core Concepts and Terminology**

This document defines the four fundamental terms you need to understand when working with the command line.

### GUI (Graphical User Interface) üñ•Ô∏è

The **GUI** is the visual environment of your operating system that you interact with using a mouse and keyboard. It includes your desktop, windows, icons, and menus. It's designed to be user-friendly for common tasks like opening folders, renaming files, or launching applications by clicking on them.

### The Terminal ‚å®Ô∏è

The **Terminal** is the application you open to access the command line. Think of it as the window into the text-based environment of your computer. Common terminal applications are `Terminal.app` on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows, or `iTerm2`, which was used in the video.

### The Command Line

The **Command Line** is the specific line inside the terminal where you type your commands. It's the direct, text-based interface for giving instructions to the computer, which is why it's called the "command line."

### The Prompt

The **Prompt** is the text that the terminal displays to show it's ready to accept a command. It appears just before the command line where you start typing. The prompt can be customized to show useful information like your current directory, username, or computer name. In the video, the prompt changed from showing `~` (the home directory) to `testing/` when the user changed directories.
