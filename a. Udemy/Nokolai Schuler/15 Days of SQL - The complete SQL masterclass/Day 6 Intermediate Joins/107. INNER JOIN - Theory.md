### üîó `INNER JOIN` in SQL ‚Äì Theory & Explanation

The **`INNER JOIN`** is used to combine rows from **two or more tables** based on a **matching condition** ‚Äî usually a **foreign key to primary key relationship**.

It returns **only the rows where there is a match** in **both tables**.

---

## üîπ **Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT 
  table1.column1, table2.column2, ...
FROM 
  table1
INNER JOIN 
  table2
ON 
  table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

## üìå **Example Schema**

### `customers` table:

|customer_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|Carol|

### `orders` table:

|order_id|customer_id|amount|
|---|---|---|
|101|1|100|
|102|2|150|
|103|4|200|

---

### ‚úÖ Query: List customers who made orders

```sql
SELECT 
  customers.name,
  orders.amount
FROM 
  customers
INNER JOIN 
  orders
ON 
  customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

**Result:**

|name|amount|
|---|---|
|Alice|100|
|Bob|150|

> `Carol` is excluded because she has no matching `order`  
> `order_id 103` is excluded because customer_id `4` doesn‚Äôt exist in `customers`

## ‚úÖ **Key Concepts**

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**INNER JOIN**|Returns only **matching rows** from both tables|
|**ON clause**|Specifies the condition that links the tables (usually by a key relationship)|
|**Eliminates NULLs**|Non-matching rows are **not shown**|

---

## ‚úÖ **Use Cases**

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|Show customer orders|Join `customers` and `orders` tables|
|Match employees with departments|Join `employees` and `departments`|
|List students and their enrolled classes|Join `students` and `enrollments`|

---

## üîÅ Equivalent Syntax with Aliases:

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### üß† Summary

- **`INNER JOIN`** = only matched rows between both tables
    
- Best for **relational lookups**
    
- **Fastest** of all joins due to limited scope (match-only)
    

---

Use `INNER JOIN` when you want to **focus on relationships** where **both sides exist**, and ignore unmatched data.
