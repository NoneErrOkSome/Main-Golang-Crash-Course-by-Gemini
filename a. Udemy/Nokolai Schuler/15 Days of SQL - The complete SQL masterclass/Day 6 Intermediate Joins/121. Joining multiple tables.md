### 🔗 Joining Multiple Tables in SQL

In SQL, you can **join more than two tables** by chaining multiple `JOIN` clauses. This is very common in normalized databases where data is split across several related tables.

---

## 🔹 **Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key
JOIN table3 ON table2.key = table3.key
...;
```

- Each `JOIN` connects one more table.
    
- You must define a valid `ON` condition for each `JOIN`.

## 📌 **Example Schema**

### `students`

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|

### `enrollments`

|enrollment_id|student_id|course_id|
|---|---|---|
|1001|1|501|
|1002|2|502|

### `courses`

|course_id|course_name|
|---|---|
|501|Math|
|502|Science|

---

### ✅ Query: Join 3 tables

```sql
SELECT 
  s.name AS student_name,
  c.course_name
FROM 
  students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

**Result:**

|student_name|course_name|
|---|---|
|Alice|Math|
|Bob|Science|

## ✅ Notes:

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`JOIN order matters`|You must match table relationships correctly|
|Use aliases (`s`, `e`, `c`)|To keep queries short and readable|
|Join on keys|Always join using `PRIMARY KEY` ↔ `FOREIGN KEY`|

---

## 🔁 Combine Different JOIN Types:

You can mix `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc., based on your needs.

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON ...
INNER JOIN C ON ...
```

---

## ✅ Use Cases:

|Goal|How to Join|
|---|---|
|Students with their courses|Join `students`, `enrollments`, `courses`|
|Orders with customer & product|Join `orders`, `customers`, `products`|
|Posts with users & comments|Join `posts`, `users`, `comments`|

Joining multiple tables is essential for querying **relational databases**, where information is separated but logically connected. With the right joins, you can **reconstruct full stories** from your data.
