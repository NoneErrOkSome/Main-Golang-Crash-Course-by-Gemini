**`GROUP BY` Multiple Columns** in SQL allows you to group data based on two or more columns. This results in more granular and detailed aggregations.

### ðŸ”· **Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

- All columns specified without an aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause **must be included** in the `GROUP BY`.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example**

Given a table `sales`:

|order_id|region|product|sales_amount|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|East|Laptop|1200|
|2|West|Laptop|1500|
|3|East|Smartphone|800|
|4|West|Smartphone|600|
|5|East|Laptop|1000|
|6|North|Tablet|300|

**Query:** Group by `region` and `product`:

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region, product;
```

**Result:**

|region|product|total_sales|
|---|---|---|
|East|Laptop|2200|
|East|Smartphone|800|
|West|Laptop|1500|
|West|Smartphone|600|
|North|Tablet|300|

### ðŸ“Œ **Ordering results with `ORDER BY`:**

For clearer analysis, you can combine `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region, product
ORDER BY region ASC, total_sales DESC;
```

**Result:**

|region|product|total_sales|
|---|---|---|
|East|Laptop|2200|
|East|Smartphone|800|
|North|Tablet|300|
|West|Laptop|1500|
|West|Smartphone|600|

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Filtering grouped data using `HAVING`:**

You can further filter grouped data using `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region, product
HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 1000;
```

**Result:**

|region|product|total_sales|
|---|---|---|
|East|Laptop|2200|
|West|Laptop|1500|

### âœ… **When to use multiple-column GROUP BY:**

- When you need aggregated results based on combinations of categories (e.g., Sales by product by region).
    
- When analyzing complex datasets with multi-dimensional relationships.

Grouping by multiple columns allows for **detailed, hierarchical, and insightful analysis** of your data.
