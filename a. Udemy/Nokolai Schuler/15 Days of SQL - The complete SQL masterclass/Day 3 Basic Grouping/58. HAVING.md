**`HAVING`** is an SQL clause used to filter groups resulting from a `GROUP BY` operation based on conditions involving aggregate functions.

Unlike `WHERE` (which filters rows before grouping), **`HAVING` filters after groups have been formed and aggregate calculations have been performed.**

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING aggregate_function(column_name) condition;
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Simple Example:**

Given a table named `sales`:

|id|region|sales_amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|East|500|
|2|West|1200|
|3|East|700|
|4|West|800|
|5|North|300|

**Query: Find regions having total sales greater than 1000.**

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 1000;
```

**Result:**

|region|total_sales|
|---|---|
|East|1200|
|West|2000|

## ðŸ”¹ **Key differences between `WHERE` and `HAVING`:**

|**WHERE**|**HAVING**|
|---|---|
|Filters **rows**|Filters **groups**|
|Used **before** grouping|Used **after** grouping|
|Can't use aggregates|Can use aggregates|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Example with multiple conditions:**

Given a table `orders`:

|order_id|customer_id|order_amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|101|1000|
|2|101|500|
|3|102|700|
|4|102|300|
|5|103|1200|

**Query: Find customers whose total orders exceed 1000 and have more than 1 order:**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS num_orders, SUM(order_amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(order_amount) > 1000 AND COUNT(order_id) > 1;
```

**Result:**

|customer_id|num_orders|total_amount|
|---|---|---|
|101|2|1500|

## âœ… **Best practices:**

- Use `HAVING` to filter grouped data based on aggregate values.
    
- Use `WHERE` to filter data before aggregation for performance.

This is how the `HAVING` clause allows you to effectively filter aggregated group data in SQL queries.
