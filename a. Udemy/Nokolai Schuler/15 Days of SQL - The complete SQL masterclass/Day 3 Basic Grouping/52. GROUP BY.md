**`GROUP BY`** in SQL groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. Itâ€™s commonly used alongside aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

- **`GROUP BY`** clause is placed after the `FROM` or `WHERE` clause.
    
- All columns listed in the `SELECT` statement (without aggregate functions) **must** appear in the `GROUP BY` clause.

## ðŸ“Œ **Example:**

Given a table called `sales`:

|id|product|category|price|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Laptop|Electronics|1000|
|2|Phone|Electronics|500|
|3|T-shirt|Clothing|20|
|4|Jeans|Clothing|40|
|5|Headphones|Electronics|100|

**Query: Group by category to get the total sales:**

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;
```

**Output:**

|category|total_sales|
|---|---|
|Electronics|1600|
|Clothing|60|

## ðŸ“Œ **Grouping by Multiple Columns:**

You can group by multiple columns to further refine results.

**Example Table:** `orders`

|order_id|customer|region|amount|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|North|200|
|2|Bob|South|150|
|3|Alice|North|100|
|4|Bob|West|120|
|5|Alice|East|80|

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT customer, region, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer, region;
```

**Output:**

|customer|region|total_amount|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|North|300|
|Alice|East|80|
|Bob|South|150|
|Bob|West|120|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **`GROUP BY` with `HAVING` Clause:**

The `HAVING` clause filters **groups** (not individual rows) based on aggregated results.

**Example:** Find regions with total sales above 200.

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(amount) > 200;
```

**Output:**

|region|total_sales|
|---|---|
|North|300|

---

## ðŸš© **Important Rules:**

- Every column in your `SELECT` statement, except for columns used in aggregate functions, must appear in your `GROUP BY` clause.
    
- The `WHERE` clause filters rows **before** grouping.
    
- The `HAVING` clause filters groups **after** aggregation.

## âœ… **Common Use Cases:**

- **Summarizing data** (e.g., sales by region).
    
- **Detecting duplicates** (using `COUNT()`).
    
- **Segmenting data** into categories.

This is how `GROUP BY` works to aggregate and summarize data effectively in SQL.
