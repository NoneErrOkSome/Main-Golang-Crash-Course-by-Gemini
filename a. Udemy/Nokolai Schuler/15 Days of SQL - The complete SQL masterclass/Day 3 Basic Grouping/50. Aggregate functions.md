Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on multiple rows of data and return a single result.

Here are the most common aggregate functions:

### 1. **COUNT()**

Returns the number of rows that match a specified criterion.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### 2. **SUM()**

Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### 3. **AVG()**

Calculates the average value of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### 4. **MIN()**

Returns the smallest value in a set.

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### 5. **MAX()**

Returns the largest value in a set.

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### Example:

Given a table `orders`:

|order_id|customer_id|amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|101|100|
|2|102|200|
|3|101|150|
|4|103|50|

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
  SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
  AVG(amount) AS average_amount,
  MIN(amount) AS smallest_order,
  MAX(amount) AS largest_order
FROM orders;
```

#### Result:

|total_orders|total_amount|average_amount|smallest_order|largest_order|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|4|500|125|50|200|

### Use with `GROUP BY`

Aggregate functions are frequently combined with the `GROUP BY` clause to group results by one or more columns.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Result:

|customer_id|total_orders|
|---|---|
|101|2|
|102|1|
|103|1|

---

### Use with `HAVING`

`HAVING` allows filtering groups after applying aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1;
```

#### Result:

|customer_id|total_orders|
|---|---|
|101|2|

Aggregate functions simplify data analysis tasks by summarizing large datasets efficiently.
