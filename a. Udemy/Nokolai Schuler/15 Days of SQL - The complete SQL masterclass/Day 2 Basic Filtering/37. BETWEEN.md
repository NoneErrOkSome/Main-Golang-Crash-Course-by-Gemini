### ðŸ”¢ `BETWEEN` in SQL

The **`BETWEEN`** operator is used in SQL to filter results **within a specific range**. It checks whether a value is **between two values**, inclusive.

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

- Includes both `value1` **and** `value2`
    
- Works for **numbers**, **dates**, and **text**

|id|name|price|
|---|---|---|
|1|Laptop|1000|
|2|Smartphone|700|
|3|Tablet|400|
|4|Headphones|200|
|5|Charger|50|

### âœ… **Numeric Range:**

```sql
SELECT name, price
FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 200 AND 800;
```

**Result:**

|name|price|
|---|---|
|Smartphone|700|
|Tablet|400|
|Headphones|200|

### âœ… **Date Range:**

If you have a `sales_date` column:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE sales_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

Returns rows with `sales_date` in 2024.

### âœ… **Text Range (Alphabetical):**

```sql
SELECT name
FROM products
WHERE name BETWEEN 'C' AND 'T';
```

Returns rows where `name` falls alphabetically between **C and T**, inclusive.

## ðŸ”¹ **NOT BETWEEN**

Use `NOT BETWEEN` to exclude a range.

```sql
SELECT name, price
FROM products
WHERE price NOT BETWEEN 200 AND 800;
```

**Result:**

|name|price|
|---|---|
|Laptop|1000|
|Charger|50|

## âœ… **Best Use Cases:**

- Filter price ranges
    
- Select records within a date range
    
- Range checks on alphanumeric values

The **`BETWEEN`** operator is a **clean and readable** way to filter data within a defined range, especially when working with numbers or dates.
