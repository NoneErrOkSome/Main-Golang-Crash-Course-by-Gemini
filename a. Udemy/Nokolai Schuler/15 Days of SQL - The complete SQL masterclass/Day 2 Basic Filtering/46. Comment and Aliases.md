### ðŸ’¬ SQL Comments and Aliases

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **SQL Comments**

Comments are used to **explain** your SQL code and **make it readable**. SQL supports two styles:

### âœ… **Single-line comment**

```sql
-- This is a single-line comment
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

### âœ… **Multi-line comment**

```sql
/* 
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
*/
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **SQL Aliases**

An **alias** gives a temporary name to a **column** or **table** for readability, formatting, or shorthand purposes.

### âœ… **Column Alias**

```sql
SELECT name AS employee_name, salary AS monthly_pay
FROM employees;
```

- `AS` is optional:
    

```sql
SELECT name employee_name, salary monthly_pay
FROM employees;
```

---

### âœ… **Table Alias**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

- Shortens long table names
    
- Improves JOIN queries readability

## ðŸ“Œ **Examples**

### ðŸ§¾ Basic Alias:

|name|salary|
|---|---|
|Alice|50000|

```sql
SELECT name AS "Employee Name", salary AS "Monthly Salary"
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

|Employee Name|Monthly Salary|
|---|---|
|Alice|50000|

---

### ðŸ§¾ Alias in Aggregate:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

---

## âœ… **Summary Table**

|Feature|Purpose|Syntax Example|
|---|---|---|
|Comment|Explain code|`-- Single-line` / `/* Multi-line */`|
|Column Alias|Rename result column|`SELECT name AS employee_name`|
|Table Alias|Shorten table name in query|`FROM employees AS e`|
