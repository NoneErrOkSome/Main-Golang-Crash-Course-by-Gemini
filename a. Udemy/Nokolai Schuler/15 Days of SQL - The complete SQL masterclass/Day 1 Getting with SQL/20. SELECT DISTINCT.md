The **`SELECT DISTINCT`** statement in SQL retrieves unique values from one or more columns. It eliminates duplicate rows from the results, providing only distinct values.

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

- **`DISTINCT`** applies to the entire row of selected columns, not just individual columns.

## ðŸ“Œ **Simple Example:**

Given a table `employees`:

|emp_id|emp_name|department|salary|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|Sales|50000|
|2|Bob|IT|60000|
|3|Charlie|Sales|55000|
|4|Diana|IT|60000|
|5|Ethan|HR|50000|

**Query: Get distinct departments:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

|department|
|---|
|Sales|
|IT|
|HR|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Using DISTINCT with multiple columns:**

**Query: Find distinct combinations of department and salary:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department, salary
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

|department|salary|
|---|---|
|Sales|50000|
|Sales|55000|
|IT|60000|
|HR|50000|

- Notice that it removes exact duplicates, but preserves unique combinations.

## ðŸ“Œ **Counting Distinct values (`COUNT DISTINCT`):**

Use `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` to count unique values:

**Query: Count how many distinct salaries are in the company:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) AS unique_salaries
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

|unique_salaries|
|---|
|3|

## âœ… **Common use cases:**

- Find unique categories, such as departments, regions, or product types.
    
- Eliminate duplicate records or combinations.
    
- Counting unique items or categories.

## ðŸš© **Performance note:**

- Use `DISTINCT` carefully, especially with large datasets, as it can slow down queries significantly.

**`SELECT DISTINCT`** is a powerful tool to identify and handle unique data within SQL queries effectively.
