The **`ORDER BY`** clause in SQL is used to sort the retrieved data in ascending or descending order. Itâ€™s commonly used with the `SELECT` statement to organize result sets clearly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

- `ASC` sorts the data in **ascending** order (default).
    
- `DESC` sorts the data in **descending** order.

## ðŸ“Œ **Simple Example:**

Given a table named `employees`:

|emp_id|emp_name|department|salary|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|Sales|50000|
|2|Bob|IT|60000|
|3|Charlie|Sales|55000|
|4|Diana|HR|48000|

**Query: Order employees by salary (high to low):**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Result:**

|emp_name|salary|
|---|---|
|Bob|60000|
|Charlie|55000|
|Alice|50000|
|Diana|48000|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Multiple Columns Sorting:**

You can sort by multiple columns, and SQL will sort by the first column listed, then the second column for rows that have the same first column value:

**Query: Sort employees by department (ascending), then by salary (descending):**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```

**Result:**

|emp_name|department|salary|
|---|---|---|
|Diana|HR|48000|
|Bob|IT|60000|
|Charlie|Sales|55000|
|Alice|Sales|50000|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **ORDER BY with Column Aliases:**

You can sort using column aliases defined in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY annual_salary DESC;
```

**Result:**

|emp_name|annual_salary|
|---|---|
|Bob|720000|
|Charlie|660000|
|Alice|600000|
|Diana|576000|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **ORDER BY with Aggregate Functions:**

Used to sort results of aggregated queries:

Given a table `sales`:

|id|product|amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|Laptop|1000|
|2|Laptop|1500|
|3|Phone|800|
|4|Laptop|2000|
|5|Phone|1200|

**Query: Products ordered by total sales amount (highest to lowest):**

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

**Result:**

|product|total_sales|
|---|---|
|Laptop|4500|
|Phone|2000|

---

## ðŸ“Œ **ORDER BY with LIMIT (TOP rows):**

To limit the number of rows returned:

MySQL/PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

**Result:**

|emp_name|salary|
|---|---|
|Bob|60000|
|Charlie|55000|

## âœ… **Best Practices:**

- Always specify `ASC` or `DESC` explicitly for readability.
    
- Use indexed columns for better performance in large tables.

Use the **`ORDER BY`** clause to clearly sort and present your SQL results in an organized and meaningful way.
