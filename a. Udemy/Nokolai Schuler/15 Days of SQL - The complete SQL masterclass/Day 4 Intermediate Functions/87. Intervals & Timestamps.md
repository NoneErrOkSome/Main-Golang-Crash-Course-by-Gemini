### ⏳ `INTERVAL` & `TIMESTAMP` in SQL

These are **date/time data types and functions** used to store, manipulate, and calculate **time-related values** in SQL (especially PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).

---

## 🔹 **1. `TIMESTAMP`**

- Represents a **date and time** (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS`)
    
- More precise than `DATE`, includes hours, minutes, and seconds
    

### ✅ Example:

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMP '2024-04-22 10:30:00' AS my_timestamp;
```

**Result:**

|my_timestamp|
|---|
|2024-04-22 10:30:00|

---

## 🔹 **2. `INTERVAL`**

- Represents a **duration** of time (e.g., 1 day, 2 hours, 3 months)
    
- Can be **added to or subtracted from** a timestamp
    

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01' + INTERVAL '7 days' AS next_week;
```

**Result:**

|next_week|
|---|
|2024-01-08 00:00:00|

---

## 📌 **Common INTERVAL units**

|Unit|Example Usage|
|---|---|
|`SECOND`|`INTERVAL '30 seconds'`|
|`MINUTE`|`INTERVAL '10 minutes'`|
|`HOUR`|`INTERVAL '5 hours'`|
|`DAY`|`INTERVAL '1 day'`|
|`WEEK`|`INTERVAL '2 weeks'`|
|`MONTH`|`INTERVAL '3 months'`|
|`YEAR`|`INTERVAL '1 year'`|
|Combined|`INTERVAL '1 year 2 days'`|

---

## 🔹 **Adding/Subtracting Intervals**

### ✅ Add 3 days:

```sql
SELECT order_date + INTERVAL '3 days' AS delivery_date
FROM orders;
```

### ✅ Subtract 1 hour:

```sql
SELECT order_date - INTERVAL '1 hour' AS adjusted_time
FROM orders;
```

---

## 🔹 **Subtracting Timestamps (Time Difference)**

### ✅ Result is an INTERVAL:

```sql
SELECT 
  delivery_date - order_date AS delivery_time
FROM orders;
```

**Example Result:**

|delivery_time|
|---|
|3 days|

---

## ✅ **Use Cases**

|Task|Example|
|---|---|
|Add 1 week to a date|`timestamp + INTERVAL '7 days'`|
|Find time between two events|`end_time - start_time`|
|Filter within last 30 days|`WHERE order_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'`|
|Schedule future event|`start_time + INTERVAL '15 minutes'`|

### 🔄 Related Functions

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|`NOW()`|Current date & time|
|`CURRENT_DATE`|Today's date (no time)|
|`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`|Same as `NOW()`|
|`AGE()` (PostgreSQL)|Age between 2 dates (formatted)|
|`DATE_PART()`|Extract parts of a timestamp|

**`TIMESTAMP`** is for **exact points in time**, while **`INTERVAL`** is for **durations**. Use them together to perform powerful time-based calculations.
