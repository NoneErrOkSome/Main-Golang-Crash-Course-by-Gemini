Great observation! Let's break it down step-by-step so it makes **visual and logical sense** — and why your instructor said it "turns the page into cram".

---

## 🔍 What does this do?

```css
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This is often called a **universal reset** or **universal baseline**.

---

### 🧱 1. `*` — Selects **every element**

This applies styles to **all HTML elements** on the page.

### 🌱 2. `*::before` and `*::after`

These include **pseudo-elements**, which are often used for decorations or helper content (`::before`, `::after`).

---

### 🧠 3. `box-sizing: border-box`

This changes how width/height is calculated:

- Without it: `width = content + padding + border`
    
- With it: `width = total width` (includes padding + border inside)
    

✅ Makes layout **predictable**  
✅ Prevents layout from "spilling out" when padding is added

---

### 🚫 4. `margin: 0;` and `padding: 0;`

These remove all **default spacing** browsers apply to many elements.

#### Example:

- `<h1>` normally has big margin-top.
    
- `<body>` has a margin by default (usually ~8px).
    
- `<ul>` and `<p>` also come with spacing.

## 🤔 Why it feels “crammed”?

When you remove **all margins and padding**, everything touches the **edges of the screen** — like this:

```plaintext
[⛔ Everything starts here at the top left]
```

That’s why your instructor said **"it turns the page into cram"** — no space, no breathing room.

---

## ✅ Why do we still use it?

We want to **start from zero**, like a blank canvas, so **we can control the layout ourselves**, instead of fighting with browser defaults.

---

## 👨‍🏫 What’s the solution?

Instead of relying on browser defaults, you **manually add spacing** where you need it:

```css
body {
  padding: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

---

## ✅ Summary:

> `margin: 0; padding: 0;` removes default spacing so you can **build your own layout from scratch** — yes, it looks "crammed" at first, but it's the cleanest way to **start designing with full control**.
