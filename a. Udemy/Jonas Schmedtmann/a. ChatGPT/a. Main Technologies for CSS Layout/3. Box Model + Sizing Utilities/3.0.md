✅ **Part 3 – Responsive Design Principles & Media Queries**

> 🎯 _To build for the modern web, you must build for variation — screen sizes, devices, user preferences, and unpredictable content. This part teaches you to master responsiveness not just as a trick, but as a design ethic._

---

## 🧠 Why This Part Is Vital

Responsive design isn’t just about “looking good on phones.”  
It’s about:

- **Designing for unpredictability**
    
- Ensuring **accessibility across devices**
    
- Creating **fluid, flexible systems** — not fixed layouts
    
- Adapting **content to space**, not the other way around
    

In this part, we will **go beyond just media queries** and cover:

- The mindset of mobile-first thinking
    
- Responsive layout strategies
    
- Scalable typography
    
- Container queries
    
- Testing strategies across environments
