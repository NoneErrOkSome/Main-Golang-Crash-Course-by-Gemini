✅ **PART 2.7 – Alignment & Spacing Inside Grid**

> 🎯 _Alignment is what transforms a grid from just “working” into feeling balanced, intentional, and elegant. It’s where logic meets design harmony._

## 🧠 Why Alignment in Grid Is Special

Unlike most layout systems, **CSS Grid allows for two-dimensional alignment**:

- You can **align content inside grid cells**
    
- You can **align grid items themselves within tracks**
    
- You can **align the entire grid content** inside its container
    

And you can do it:

- Horizontally (on the **inline axis**)
    
- Vertically (on the **block axis**)
    

> This deep control makes Grid not just powerful — but precise.

## 🧱 The 3 Levels of Alignment in Grid

|Level|Controls...|Affects...|
|---|---|---|
|Grid container → grid items|`justify-items`, `align-items`|**All** items inside their cells|
|Individual grid item|`justify-self`, `align-self`|**One** item inside its cell|
|Grid container → track area|`justify-content`, `align-content`|The **whole grid** inside itself|

Let’s dive into each level with examples.

---

## 🔷 1. **Item Alignment Within Grid Cells**

These properties **align items inside their cells**, similar to aligning content inside a table cell.

### ✅ Use `justify-items` and `align-items` on the grid container

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center;
  align-items: start;
}
```

|Property|Axis|Options|
|---|---|---|
|`justify-items`|horizontal|`start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch` (default)|
|`align-items`|vertical|`start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch` (default)|

---

### 🔸 Example: Center All Content in Cells

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Every item is centered **inside its own cell** both vertically and horizontally.

---

### 🔸 Stretch (default behavior)

If no value is set:

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch;
  justify-items: stretch;
}
```

✅ Items expand to **fill their grid cell** (if width/height not fixed)

---

## 🔷 2. **Aligning Individual Grid Items**

Sometimes you want to **override the default alignment** for one item.

Use:

```css
.item {
  justify-self: end;
  align-self: start;
}
```

|Property|Axis|Targeted Element|
|---|---|---|
|`justify-self`|horizontal|individual item|
|`align-self`|vertical|individual item|

### 🔸 Real-World Example:

```css
.card-featured {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  justify-self: center;
  align-self: end;
}
```

✅ Used for:

- Special callouts
    
- Buttons in bottom corner
    
- Featured content centered across tracks
    

---

## 🔷 3. **Aligning the Whole Grid Inside Its Container**

Sometimes your **entire grid layout** doesn’t take up all available space.  
You can then control its alignment within the container.

Use:

```css
.container {
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
}
```

|Property|Axis|Affects...|
|---|---|---|
|`justify-content`|horizontal|aligns the **tracks** inside the container|
|`align-content`|vertical|aligns the **tracks** inside the container|

---

### 🔸 Example: Shrink-Wrapped Grid, Centered

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

✅ Result:

- The **entire 2×2 grid** is centered inside the container
    
- There is spacing between the cells (via `gap`)
    
- The grid itself does **not stretch to 100% width**
    

---

### 🔸 Behavior Depends on Space Left Over

If your grid uses `1fr`, it stretches by default and fills 100%.  
`justify-content` has no effect **unless there’s leftover space**.

To enable visible alignment:

- Use fixed column widths
    
- Or shrink content inside cells
    

---

## 🔶 4. `place-*` Shorthands (Human-Friendly Alignment)

Shorthand for both axes:

|Shorthand|Expands To|
|---|---|
|`place-items`|`align-items` + `justify-items`|
|`place-self`|`align-self` + `justify-self`|
|`place-content`|`align-content` + `justify-content`|

### Example:

```css
.container {
  place-items: center;
}
```

✅ All items are centered in both axes inside their cells

---

## 🧩 5. Visualizing All Levels Together

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;
  place-items: center;
  place-content: center;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

```css
.item-special {
  place-self: end start;
}
```

✅ This:

- Centers the grid in the page
    
- Centers all items in their cells
    
- Pushes `.item-special` to the **bottom-left corner** of its own cell
    

---

## 🧠 What About `gap`?

### `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`

These create **consistent spacing between tracks**, not inside cells.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

✅ `gap` is often better than using margin:

- It respects Grid flow
    
- Avoids margin collapse
    
- Is easier to maintain for evenly spaced grids
    

---

### 💡 Spacing Best Practices

|If You Need...|Use...|
|---|---|
|Space between items|`gap`, not `margin`|
|One item to align differently|`place-self`, `align-self`, etc.|
|All items inside cells aligned|`place-items`, `align-items`|
|Entire grid aligned|`place-content`, `align-content`|

---

## ✅ Summary: Alignment & Spacing in CSS Grid

|Layer|Horizontal|Vertical|Shorthand|
|---|---|---|---|
|Whole Grid|`justify-content`|`align-content`|`place-content`|
|All Items in Grid|`justify-items`|`align-items`|`place-items`|
|Individual Item|`justify-self`|`align-self`|`place-self`|
|Track Spacing|`column-gap`|`row-gap`|`gap`|

---

## 🧪 Final Thought:

> A layout without alignment is noise.  
> A layout with intentional alignment — is harmony.

Mastering alignment transforms your UI from “blocks on a screen” into **an experience that flows.**  
It is the designer’s discipline and the developer’s responsibility.  
This is how we elevate the web — together.
