✅ **PART 1 – Grid Basics & Terminology**

> 🎯 _Before you place a single item on a grid, you need to deeply understand the building blocks of the Grid system itself._

## 🧠 What Is CSS Grid?

**CSS Grid** is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It allows you to control layout in **rows and columns simultaneously** — unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional (row _or_ column at a time).

CSS Grid:

- Is **declarative** — you describe the layout up front
    
- Can **auto-place** or **manually place** items
    
- Can create **complex layouts** without media queries or floats
    
- Works beautifully with **responsive units**, **named areas**, and **grid-aware alignment**

## 🧱 Core Concept: Every Grid Has Two Roles

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|**Grid Container**|The parent element where grid layout is applied|
|**Grid Items**|The direct children of that container|

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">A</div>
  <div class="grid-item">B</div>
</div>
```

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}
```

✅ The `display: grid` declaration activates **grid behavior**.

---

## 📦 1. Grid Container

When you set `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid` on an element, it becomes a **grid container**.  
This unlocks access to:

- Defining rows and columns
    
- Spacing items with gaps
    
- Aligning items in both axes
    
- Positioning items precisely
    

There are **no visual changes** until you define columns or rows.

---

## 🧩 2. Grid Items

These are the **direct children** of the grid container.  
Nested elements (grandchildren or deeper) are **not part of the grid** unless the child becomes its own grid container.

Each grid item:

- Can be automatically placed
    
- Can span multiple rows or columns
    
- Can be explicitly positioned using `grid-column`, `grid-row`, or `grid-area`

## 🔢 3. Grid Tracks and Lines

### 🔹 **Tracks**

A **grid track** is a row or column.

- Rows = horizontal tracks
    
- Columns = vertical tracks
    
- You define them using:
    
    - `grid-template-columns`
        
    - `grid-template-rows`
        

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* 3 equal columns */
grid-template-rows: auto 200px;     /* 2 rows */
```

### 🔹 **Lines**

Grid lines are the **boundaries between tracks**.

- Columns are numbered left to right: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
    
- Rows are numbered top to bottom: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
    
- You can refer to lines directly to **position items manually**
    

Example:

```css
grid-column: 1 / 3; /* spans from line 1 to line 3 */
```

---

## 🔲 4. Grid Cells

- A **grid cell** is the space between one row and one column
    
- Think of it as a **single slot** in the grid layout
    
- It can hold 1 item (or more if they overlap)
    

If you define a 3x2 grid, it has `3 * 2 = 6` cells.

---

## 🔳 5. Grid Areas

A **grid area** is a **rectangle** covering one or more cells.

You can define it:

- With **line numbers** (`grid-column: 1 / 3`, `grid-row: 1 / 2`)
    
- With **names** (`grid-area: header`, via `grid-template-areas` — coming in Part 6)
    

Example:

```css
.grid-item {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 3; /* From row 1 to 3, column 1 to 3 */
}
```

✅ This places the item in a block of 4 cells (2 rows x 2 columns)

---

## 📐 6. Implicit vs Explicit Grid

|Type|Created by Developer|Automatically Created|
|---|---|---|
|**Explicit**|Using `grid-template-columns/rows`|—|
|**Implicit**|—|When items overflow the explicit grid|

Example:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

If you place **5 items**, but define only **2 columns**,  
the browser will **automatically create new rows** for the extra items — this is the **implicit grid**.

Control implicit row sizes with:

```css
grid-auto-rows: 150px;
```

---

## 🧮 7. Grid Axes (for alignment and flow)

- **Inline Axis (X axis)** = horizontal = controlled by `justify-*`
    
- **Block Axis (Y axis)** = vertical = controlled by `align-*`
    

Example:

```css
place-items: center; /* shorthand for justify-items + align-items */
```

✅ Grid lets you align items **both horizontally and vertically** — something Flexbox alone doesn’t do well in complex layouts.

## ✅ Summary: CSS Grid Terminology Map

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Grid Container|Element with `display: grid`|
|Grid Item|Direct child of the grid container|
|Grid Line|Numbered vertical or horizontal divider|
|Grid Track|A row or a column|
|Grid Cell|One single “slot” in the layout|
|Grid Area|A rectangular region across one or more cells|
|Explicit Grid|Defined using `grid-template-*`|
|Implicit Grid|Automatically created for overflow or auto placement|
|Inline Axis|Left → right (horizontal)|
|Block Axis|Top → bottom (vertical)|
