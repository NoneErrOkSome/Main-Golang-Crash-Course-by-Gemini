### Spread Operator

#### Purpose
The spread operator (`...`) is a versatile JavaScript feature introduced in ES6, designed to expand or unpack elements from an iterable (such as arrays or strings) into individual elements. This enables you to efficiently insert multiple elements into contexts where individual values are expected.

#### Use Cases

1. **Array Expansion**:
   - You can use the spread operator to include all elements of an existing array within a new array, or mix them with other elements.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     const oldArray = [3, 4, 5];
     const newArray = [1, 2, ...oldArray]; // Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     ```

2. **Function Arguments**:
   - The spread operator allows you to pass array elements as separate arguments to a function. This is particularly useful when dealing with functions that require multiple parameters.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function sum(a, b, c) {
       return a + b + c;
     }
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
     console.log(sum(...numbers)); // Output: 6
     ```

3. **Merging Arrays**:
   - Combine multiple arrays into one using the spread operator. This is a concise and readable way to concatenate arrays.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const array1 = [1, 2];
     const array2 = [3, 4];
     const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2]; // Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
     ```

4. **Shallow Copying**:
   - Create shallow copies of arrays for immutability purposes. By spreading an array into a new one, you ensure that changes to the new array do not affect the original.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const originalArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
     const copiedArray = [...originalArray];
     copiedArray.push('d');
     
     console.log(originalArray); // Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
     console.log(copiedArray);   // Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
     ```

The spread operator enhances JavaScript's ability to work with collections by providing powerful tools for expanding and combining data structures in a flexible and efficient manner.
