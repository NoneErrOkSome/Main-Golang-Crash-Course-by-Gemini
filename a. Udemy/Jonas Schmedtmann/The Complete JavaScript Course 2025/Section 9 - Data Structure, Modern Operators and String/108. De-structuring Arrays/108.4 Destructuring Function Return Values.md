Of course. Here is a brief document on the topic of Destructuring a Function's Return Values.

### How to Destructure Function Return Values

**1. What is it?**

In JavaScript, a function can return an array containing multiple values. Array destructuring provides a highly convenient way to immediately unpack these returned values into separate, distinct variables in a single line. This technique makes it feel as though the function is returning multiple independent values at once.

**2. The Concept**

Instead of receiving a single array object and then accessing its elements by index, you can apply destructuring directly to the result of the function call. This leads to cleaner, more readable code by immediately assigning the returned data to named variables.

---

**3. An Example: An Ordering System**

Imagine a function within a restaurant application that takes two indexes and returns the corresponding starter and main course from the menu.

**The Function:**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const restaurant = {
  starterMenu: ['Focaccia', 'Bruschetta', 'Garlic Bread', 'Caprese Salad'],
  mainMenu: ['Pizza', 'Pasta', 'Risotto'],

  // This function finds two items and returns them in an array
  order(starterIndex, mainIndex) {
    const starter = this.starterMenu[starterIndex];
    const main = this.mainMenu[mainIndex];
    return [starter, main];
  }
};
```

**Using Destructuring to Capture the Return Value:**

Now, when we call the `order` function, we can instantly capture its results into variables.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Call the function and destructure the returned array immediately.
// We want the 3rd starter (index 2) and the 1st main course (index 0).
const [starterCourse, mainCourse] = restaurant.order(2, 0);

console.log(starterCourse); // Output: "Garlic Bread"
console.log(mainCourse);    // Output: "Pizza"
```

**How it Works:**

1. The `restaurant.order(2, 0)` function is executed and returns the array `['Garlic Bread', 'Pizza']`.
2. The destructuring assignment `[starterCourse, mainCourse]` is applied directly to this returned array.
3. The first element, `'Garlic Bread'`, is assigned to the `starterCourse` variable.
4. The second element, `'Pizza'`, is assigned to the `mainCourse` variable.

This approach is far more direct and descriptive than handling the array manually, for example:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// The less direct way
const orderArr = restaurant.order(2, 0);
const starter = orderArr[0];
const main = orderArr[1];
```

By destructuring directly, you create more concise and elegant code when handling functions that return multiple pieces of related data.
