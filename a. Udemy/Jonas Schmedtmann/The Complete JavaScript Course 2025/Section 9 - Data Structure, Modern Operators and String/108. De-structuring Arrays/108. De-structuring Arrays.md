Based on the transcript, there are **six** distinct topics dedicated to array destructuring.

---

### 1. Basic Destructuring

This is the fundamental concept of unpacking elements from an array into individual variables using a simple `const [x, y, z] = arr;` syntax, which is easier than assigning each variable by its index.

### 2. Skipping Elements

You can selectively pull elements from an array by leaving a "hole" in the destructuring assignment. For example, `const [first, , third] = categories;` will grab the first and third elements while ignoring the second.

### 3. Switching Variables

A practical trick where you can swap the values of two variables without needing a temporary variable. This is done by reassigning them from a destructured array: `[main, secondary] = [secondary, main];`.

### 4. Destructuring Function Return Values

A function can return an array, and you can immediately destructure the result into separate variables. This effectively allows a function to return multiple values that are instantly usable.

### 5. Nested Destructuring

This covers how to unpack values from an array that is located inside another array. You do this by nesting the destructuring syntax, like `const [i, , [j, k]] = nested;`, to access the inner elements directly.

### 6. Setting Default Values

You can assign a default value to a variable during destructuring. This is useful when you don't know the length of the array and want to prevent a variable from being `undefined` if its corresponding element doesn't exist. For example: `const [p=1, q=1, r=1] = [8, 9];` will result in `r` being `1`.
