Of course. Here is a brief document on the topic of Switching Variables using array destructuring.

### How to Switch Variables with Destructuring

**1. What is it?**

Switching variables is the process of swapping the values held by two variables. Array destructuring provides a modern, highly readable, and efficient way to achieve this without needing a temporary variable.

**2. The Traditional Method (Without Destructuring)**

Traditionally, to swap two variables, you needed a third, temporary variable to hold one of the values during the swap. Otherwise, one of the original values would be overwritten and lost.

**Example:**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let main = 'Italian';
let secondary = 'Vegetarian';

// 1. Store the original value of 'main' in a temporary variable
const temp = main; // temp is 'Italian'

// 2. Overwrite 'main' with the value of 'secondary'
main = secondary; // main is now 'Vegetarian'

// 3. Update 'secondary' with the value from the temporary variable
secondary = temp; // secondary is now 'Italian'

console.log(main, secondary); // Output: Vegetarian Italian
```

**3. The Modern Method (With Destructuring)** üîÅ

Destructuring simplifies this process immensely. You can achieve the same result in a single, intuitive line of code.

**Example:**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let main = 'Italian';
let secondary = 'Vegetarian';

// Create an array with the variables in the new, desired order
// and immediately destructure it back into the original variables.
[main, secondary] = [secondary, main];

console.log(main, secondary); // Output: Vegetarian Italian
```

**How it Works:**

1. A new, temporary array `[secondary, main]` is created on the right side. At this moment, it evaluates to `['Vegetarian', 'Italian']`.
2. The destructuring assignment `[main, secondary]` on the left side then unpacks this new array.
3. The first element of the new array (`'Vegetarian'`) is assigned to `main`.
4. The second element (`'Italian'`) is assigned to `secondary`.

The swap is completed in one atomic operation, making the code cleaner and less error-prone. Note that you must use `let` (or `var`) to declare the variables, as you are reassigning their values.
