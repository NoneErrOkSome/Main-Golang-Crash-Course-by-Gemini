## JavaScript Object Methods: Detailed FAQ 🛠️

This FAQ delves into how functions are used as methods within JavaScript objects, the role of the `this` keyword, and practical applications.

---

### Q1: What exactly is an "object method" in JavaScript?

A:

An object method is essentially a function that is stored as a property value within an object. The instructor from your transcript explains, "Any function that is attached to an object is called a method." So, if you have an object and one of its properties holds a function, that property is considered a method of the object.

Think of it this way: objects have properties that describe them (like `firstName` or `age`), and they can also have properties that define actions they can perform or calculations they can make (these are the methods).

---

### Q2: How do I define or add a method to an object?

A:

You define a method by creating a key-value pair in an object, where the key is the method's name and the value is a function expression.

The transcript demonstrates this:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  birthYear: 1991, // Simplified to just the birthYear
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'],
  hasDriversLicense: true,

  // Method definition using a function expression
  calcAge: function(birthYearParam) { // 'birthYearParam' to distinguish from object's property initially
    return 2037 - birthYearParam;
  }
};
```

The instructor clarifies: "here we need an expression. And so this will work indeed." This refers to the function expression `function(birthYearParam) { ... }` being assigned as the value to the `calcAge` key.

---

### Q3: Can I use a function declaration (e.g., `function calcAge() {...}`) directly to define an object method?

A:

No, you generally cannot use a standard function declaration syntax directly as the value for an object property when defining an object literal. The transcript states, "we could have not used a function declaration here... that would not work, we would certainly get an error here... because this is a declaration. And so it doesn't work here, here, we need an expression."

You must use a function expression (either a traditional `function() {}` or an arrow function `() => {}`) when defining a method directly within an object literal.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const myObject = {
  // Correct: Function Expression
  myMethod1: function() { console.log('Method 1 (Expression)'); },

  // Correct: Arrow Function (also an expression)
  myMethod2: () => console.log('Method 2 (Arrow)'),

  // Incorrect for direct assignment in object literal:
  // myMethod3: function declaredMethod() { console.log('This is a declaration'); } // Syntax Error
};
```

---

### Q4: How do I call an object method once it's defined?

A:

You call an object method similar to how you access a property, but you add parentheses () at the end (with any required arguments inside) because you're executing a function. You can use either dot notation or bracket notation.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  birthYear: 1991,
  calcAge: function() { // Modified to use 'this' later
    // For now, let's imagine it still needs a parameter
    // return 2037 - birthYearParameter;
    // Better: use 'this' as shown in later questions
    return 2037 - this.birthYear;
  }
};

// Using dot notation to call the method
// We don't need to pass birthYear if the method uses 'this.birthYear'
const ageFromMethodDot = jonas.calcAge();
console.log("Age (dot notation):", ageFromMethodDot); // Output: 46

// Using bracket notation to call the method
const ageFromMethodBracket = jonas['calcAge']();
console.log("Age (bracket notation):", ageFromMethodBracket); // Output: 46
```

The transcript explains: "jonas.calcAge is computed. And so this here will become the function value. And then with the parenthesis, we call that function value".

---

### Q5: What is the `this` keyword, and how does it work inside an object method?

A:

The this keyword is a special variable that JavaScript makes available inside every method (except for arrow functions, which handle this differently).

"The this keyword or the this variable is basically equal to the object on which the method is called, or in other words, it is equal to the object calling the method."

So, if you have `jonas.calcAge()`, inside the `calcAge` method, `this` will refer to the `jonas` object itself. This allows the method to access other properties of the same object directly.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: 'teacher',

  calcAge: function() {
    // 'this' refers to the 'jonas' object because 'jonas' is calling calcAge
    console.log(this); // Will log the entire jonas object
    return 2037 - this.birthYear; // Accesses jonas.birthYear
  }
};

const age = jonas.calcAge();
console.log(`${jonas.firstName} is ${age} years old.`); // Output: Jonas is 46 years old.
```

The transcript demonstrates: "let's also log `this` to the console, and indeed, this is the whole Jonas object... because the Jonas object is the one who is calling this method".

---

### Q6: Why should I use `this.propertyName` inside a method instead of `objectName.propertyName` (e.g., `this.birthYear` vs. `jonas.birthYear`)?

A:

Using this.propertyName makes your method more robust, reusable, and less prone to errors if the object's variable name changes.

The transcript explains this by considering renaming jonas to jonas2:

"If we had jonas.birthYear [hardcoded inside the method]... and we change the name of the object... to jonas2... then the code will no longer automatically work, because now jonas is not defined... we would have to... manually change this as well, while if we had the this keyword, then everything will keep working... because now this will simply point to jonas2, because that is the object calling the method. And so therefore it's always a good idea to reference the object itself and not hard-code the name of the object."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let person = {
  name: 'Alex',
  birthYear: 1995,
  greet: function() {
    // Good practice: using 'this'
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I was born in ${this.birthYear}.`;
    // Avoid: return `Hello, my name is ${person.name}...`;
    // Because if 'person' variable name changes, this line breaks.
  }
};
console.log(person.greet());

let anotherPerson = person; // 'anotherPerson' now refers to the same object
person = null; // The original 'person' variable no longer points to the object

// console.log(person.greet()); // This would error if greet used 'person.name'
console.log(anotherPerson.greet()); // This still works because 'this' inside greet refers to 'anotherPerson'
```

### Q7: Can a method create and store new properties on the object it belongs to? Why would I do that?

A:

Yes, a method can calculate a value and then store it as a new property on the object using the this keyword.

The main reason to do this is for efficiency. If a calculation is somewhat "heavy" or if its result is needed multiple times, you can calculate it once, store it on the object, and then subsequent requests for that data can just retrieve the pre-calculated property value.

The transcript shows this for calculating and storing age:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  birthYear: 1991,
  // ... other properties

  calcAge: function() {
    // "we can now use the this keyword also to store a new property."
    // "we calculate the age, and then we create a new property on the current object."
    if (!this.age) { // Calculate only if 'this.age' doesn't exist yet
        this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear;
    }
    return this.age;
  }
};

// First call: calculates and stores this.age
console.log(jonas.calcAge()); // Output: 46
console.log("Jonas object after first call:", jonas); // Shows the new 'age: 46' property

// Subsequent calls: can retrieve the stored property (or re-calculate if logic allows)
console.log(jonas.age);       // Output: 46 (accessing the property directly)
console.log(jonas.calcAge()); // Output: 46 (method returns the stored property)
```

The instructor states, "it would be a bad practice to do this [heavy computation] multiple times. Instead, what we can do is to just calculate the age once, then store it in the object, and then when we need it at a later point, we can then just retrieve the age as a property from the object... this is the most efficient solution".

---

### Q8: Can an object method call another method of the _same_ object?

A:

Yes, absolutely. Using the this keyword, a method can call other methods that belong to the same object. This promotes modularity within the object itself.

The transcript demonstrates this with a `getSummary` method calling `calcAge`:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: 'teacher',
  hasDriversLicense: true,

  calcAge: function() {
    if (!this.age) {
      this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear;
    }
    return this.age;
  },

  getSummary: function() {
    // "this.calcAge will call this other method and this will then return the age."
    return `${this.firstName} is a ${this.calcAge()}-year old ${this.job}, and he has ${this.hasDriversLicense ? 'a' : 'no'} driver's license.`;
  }
};

console.log(jonas.getSummary());
// Output: Jonas is a 46-year old teacher, and he has a driver's license.
```

The instructor explains the call `this.calcAge()`: "`this` is Jonas in this object, and so `this` is essentially the same as writing it here [calling `jonas.calcAge()` outside the object]."

---

### Q9: How are object methods (that I define) different from standalone functions I've written before?

A:

The main difference is context and association:

- **Standalone Functions:** Exist independently. They don't inherently "belong" to a particular object.
- **Object Methods:** Are properties of an object whose values are functions. They are "attached" to the object and are typically designed to operate on the data within that object (often using the `this` keyword).

While the underlying function mechanism is similar, methods have direct access to the object they are part of via `this`, allowing them to interact with other properties and methods of that object in an encapsulated way.

---

### Q10: The transcript mentions that arrays are also objects and have methods like `push()`. How does that relate to what I just learned about object methods?

A:

This is an important connection! The transcript states: "arrays are actually also objects, they are just a special kind of object. And so they have functions, or in other words they have methods that we can use to manipulate them like push, pop, shift and unshift and many more."

Just like you defined a `calcAge` method on your `jonas` object, arrays come with pre-defined methods (like `push`, `pop`, `indexOf`) that are part of their built-in functionality. When you do `friends.push('Jay')`, you are calling the `push` method _on the `friends` array object_. This is conceptually similar to calling `jonas.calcAge()`. Arrays are specialized objects optimized for ordered collections, and they come with a suite of useful methods for that purpose.

### Q11: In "Coding Challenge #3" (Mark and John BMI), how was the `this` keyword used within the objects to calculate BMI?

A:

In Coding Challenge #3, you were asked to create objects for Mark and John, each with properties for fullName, mass, and height, and a method calcBMI.

The `calcBMI` method within each object would use `this` to refer to the object it was being called on (either Mark's object or John's object). This allowed the method to access the specific `mass` and `height` of that person and then store the calculated BMI as a new property (e.g., `this.bmi`) on that same person's object.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Based on Coding Challenge #3 structure from "Fundamentals-Part-2/final/script.js"
const mark = {
  fullName: 'Mark Miller',
  mass: 78,     // kg
  height: 1.69, // meters
  calcBMI: function () {
    // 'this' refers to the 'mark' object when mark.calcBMI() is called
    this.bmi = this.mass / (this.height ** 2);
    return this.bmi;
  }
};

const john = {
  fullName: 'John Smith',
  mass: 92,
  height: 1.95,
  calcBMI: function () {
    // 'this' refers to the 'john' object when john.calcBMI() is called
    this.bmi = this.mass / (this.height ** 2);
    return this.bmi;
  }
};

mark.calcBMI(); // 'this' inside calcBMI refers to 'mark'
john.calcBMI(); // 'this' inside calcBMI refers to 'john'

console.log(`${mark.fullName}'s BMI: ${mark.bmi}`);
console.log(`${john.fullName}'s BMI: ${john.bmi}`);

if (mark.bmi > john.bmi) {
  console.log(`${mark.fullName}'s BMI (${mark.bmi.toFixed(1)}) is higher than ${john.fullName}'s BMI (${john.bmi.toFixed(1)})!`);
} else if (john.bmi > mark.bmi) {
  console.log(`${john.fullName}'s BMI (${john.bmi.toFixed(1)}) is higher than ${mark.fullName}'s BMI (${mark.bmi.toFixed(1)})!`);
} else {
  console.log("They have the same BMI!");
}
```

In this challenge, `this.mass` correctly accesses Mark's mass when `mark.calcBMI()` is called, and John's mass when `john.calcBMI()` is called, because `this` dynamically refers to the object calling the method.
