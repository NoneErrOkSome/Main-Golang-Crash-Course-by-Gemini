## JavaScript Functions: Reusable Code Blocks

Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, acting as reusable blocks of code that can be executed multiple times. They help in organizing code, making it more maintainable and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### 1. Basic Function: Declaration and Calling

A function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by a name, parentheses `()`, and a block of code (the function body) enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

To use a function, you "call" or "invoke" it by its name followed by parentheses.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// 1. Defining a simple function (no input, no output value)
function logger() {
  console.log('My name is Jonas');
}

// 2. Calling / running / invoking the function
logger(); // Output: My name is Jonas
logger(); // Output: My name is Jonas
logger(); // Output: My name is Jonas
```

This `logger` function doesn't take any input and doesn't explicitly return a value. Its sole purpose is to execute the `console.log` statement. If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `undefined`.

### 2. Functions with Parameters and Return Values

Functions become more powerful when they can receive input data (**parameters**) and return output data (**return values**). Think of them like machines: you put ingredients in, the machine processes them, and then it gives you a product back.

- **Parameters**: Variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the input values.
- **Arguments**: The actual values passed to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the parameters.
- **`return` statement**: Used to output a value from the function. When a `return` statement is executed, the function stops executing and the specified value is "returned" to the place where the function was called.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Defining a function that takes parameters and returns a value
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  // apples and oranges are parameters
  // console.log(apples, oranges); // You can use parameters like variables inside the function

  const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
  return juice; // This string will be the output of the function
}

// Calling the function with arguments and capturing the returned value
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0); // 5 and 0 are arguments
console.log(appleJuice);
// Output: Juice with 5 apples and 0 oranges.

// Calling the function again with different arguments
const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice);
// Output: Juice with 2 apples and 4 oranges.

// You can also use the returned value directly without storing it
console.log(fruitProcessor(3, 3));
// Output: Juice with 3 apples and 3 oranges.
```

**Recap of the `fruitProcessor` execution:**

1. `fruitProcessor(5, 0)` is called.
2. Inside the function, `apples` becomes `5` and `oranges` becomes `0`.
3. The string `Juice with 5 apples and 0 oranges.` is created and stored in the `juice` variable.
4. `return juice;` sends this string back as the result of the `fruitProcessor(5, 0)` call.
5. This returned string is then assigned to the `appleJuice` variable.

### 3. Importance of Calling Functions

If a function is defined but never called, the code inside its body will never run.



```JavaScript
function neverCalled() {
  console.log("This message will not appear unless the function is called.");
}
// To see the message, you would need to add: neverCalled();
```

### 4. Built-in Functions

JavaScript has many built-in functions. You've already used some:

- `console.log()`: A function that takes arguments (what you want to print) and displays them in the console.
- `Number()`: A function that takes an argument (e.g., a string) and attempts to convert it into a number, then returns that number.



```JavaScript
const yearString = "1991";
const yearNumber = Number(yearString); // Calling the Number function
console.log(yearNumber); // Output: 1991 (as a number)
```

Functions are essential for writing structured, efficient, and reusable code. They allow you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
