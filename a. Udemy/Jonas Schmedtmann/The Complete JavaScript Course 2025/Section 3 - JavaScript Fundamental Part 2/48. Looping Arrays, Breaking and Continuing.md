## Advanced `for` Loop Techniques: Looping Arrays, `continue`, and `break`

This document explores advanced applications of the `for` loop in JavaScript, focusing on iterating through arrays, transforming array data, and controlling loop execution with `continue` and `break` statements.

### Looping Through Arrays: A Core Application

One of the most common and powerful uses of `for` loops is to iterate over the elements of an array. This allows you to access and process each element individually.

Let's start with an example array (referred to as `jonasArray` in the transcript):

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// From the "Introduction to Objects" lecture, the jonasArray
const jonasDataArray = [
  'Jonas',
  'Schmedtmann',
  2037 - 1991, // Age: 46
  'teacher',
  ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'], // Friends array
  true // Added later in the transcript for demonstration
];
```

To loop through this array and log each element, we construct a `for` loop:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
console.log("--- Looping Through jonasDataArray ---");
for (let i = 0; i < jonasDataArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(jonasDataArray[i], typeof jonasDataArray[i]);
}
```

**Explanation of the Loop Structure for Arrays:**

1. **Initialization (`let i = 0;`)**:
    
    - The counter, traditionally named `i` for "index," is initialized to `0`.
    - The transcript explains: **"this time we need to start it at zero. And that's because the array is zero based when it comes to reading elements out of the array."** The first element is at index `0`.
2. **Condition (`i < jonasDataArray.length;`)**:
    
    - The loop continues as long as `i` is _less than_ the length of the array.
    - For an array of length 6, the valid indices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. `jonasDataArray.length` is 6. So, the loop runs while `i` is 0 through 5. When `i` becomes 6, `6 < 6` is false, and the loop terminates.
    - Using `jonasDataArray.length` is crucial because it's dynamic. The instructor highlights: **"the solution to this, is to not hard code the value here but to compute this value... And so we can simply replace the hard-coded value with a dynamically calculated one. and that's `Jonas.length`."** (Here, `Jonas` refers to the array variable). This ensures the loop works correctly even if elements are added or removed from the array.
3. **Increment (`i++;`)**:
    
    - After each iteration, the counter `i` is incremented by 1, moving to the next element's index.
4. **Accessing Elements (`jonasDataArray[i]`)**:
    
    - Inside the loop, `jonasDataArray[i]` is used to access the element at the current index `i`.

**Output of the above loop:**

```JavaScript
Jonas string
Schmedtmann string
46 number
teacher string
(3) ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'] object // Arrays are objects
true boolean
```

The transcript confirms: **"remember how I said that an array is in fact an object and here we have the proof of that."**

### Creating New Arrays Based on Existing Arrays

Loops are often used to iterate through one array, perform some operations on its elements, and store the results in a new array.

Let's create a new array containing the data types of each element in `jonasDataArray`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- Creating a New Array (types) ---");
const typesArray = []; // Start with an empty array

for (let i = 0; i < jonasDataArray.length; i++) {
  // Method 1: Assigning to a specific index (less common for adding to end)
  // typesArray[i] = typeof jonasDataArray[i];

  // Method 2: Using the push() method (preferred for adding to end)
  // "we could use the push method, right? So that would be types.push."
  typesArray.push(typeof jonasDataArray[i]);
}
console.log("Original jonasDataArray:", jonasDataArray);
console.log("Newly created typesArray:", typesArray);
```

**Explanation:**

1. An empty array `typesArray` is initialized before the loop.
2. The `for` loop iterates through `jonasDataArray` using the same counter logic as before.
3. Inside the loop:
    - `typeof jonasDataArray[i]` gets the data type of the current element.
    - `typesArray.push(...)` adds this data type string to the end of `typesArray`. The transcript mentions, "if you prefer this first way here [direct assignment] then of course you can just use that one as well. But what matters here, is that we really understood the logic".

**Output:**

```JavaScript
Original jonasDataArray: (6) ['Jonas', 'Schmedtmann', 46, 'teacher', Array(3), true]
Newly created typesArray: (6) ['string', 'string', 'number', 'string', 'object', 'boolean']
```

### Practical Example: Calculating Ages from Birth Years

A very common and practical use case is to process an array of input values (like birth years) and create a new array of derived values (like ages).

JavaScript

```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- Calculating Ages from Birth Years ---");
const birthYears = [1991, 2007, 1969, 2020];
const ages = []; // Empty array to hold calculated ages

for (let i = 0; i < birthYears.length; i++) {
  const currentBirthYear = birthYears[i];
  const age = 2037 - currentBirthYear; // Calculate age
  ages.push(age); // Add the calculated age to the 'ages' array
}

console.log("Birth Years:", birthYears);
console.log("Calculated Ages:", ages);
```

Explanation:

The loop iterates through each currentBirthYear in the birthYears array. For each year, it calculates the age (assuming the current year is 2037 for consistency with the transcript) and pushes this calculated age into the ages array.

The transcript clarifies why this element-by-element processing is necessary: "We cannot do an operations between simple values and an array. So... We can not do 2037 - the years array. That will just give us not a number. And so here in this loop, we basically did it individually."

**Output:**

```JavaScript
Birth Years: (4) [1991, 2007, 1969, 2020]
Calculated Ages: (4) [46, 30, 68, 17]
```

### Controlling Loop Execution: `continue` and `break`

JavaScript provides two important statements to control the flow within loops:

1. **`continue` Statement**:
    
    - The `continue` statement is used **"to exit the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next one."**
    - When `continue` is encountered, the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds directly to the next iteration (updating the counter and checking the condition).
    
    **Example: Logging only strings from `jonasDataArray`**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    console.log('\n--- Using "continue": Logging ONLY STRINGS ---');
    for (let i = 0; i < jonasDataArray.length; i++) {
      if (typeof jonasDataArray[i] !== 'string') {
        continue; // Skip to the next iteration if the current element is not a string
      }
      // This line only executes if the 'continue' above was NOT triggered
      console.log(jonasDataArray[i], typeof jonasDataArray[i]);
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    Jonas string
    Schmedtmann string
    teacher string
    ```
    
2. **`break` Statement**:
    
    - The `break` statement is used **"to completely terminate the whole loop."**
    - When `break` is encountered, the loop stops immediately, and program execution continues with the code following the loop.
    
    **Example: Logging elements until a number is found**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```
    console.log('\n--- Using "break": Logging until a NUMBER is found ---');
    for (let i = 0; i < jonasDataArray.length; i++) {
      if (typeof jonasDataArray[i] === 'number') {
        break; // Terminate the loop completely if a number is found
      }
      // This line only executes if 'break' was NOT triggered
      console.log(jonasDataArray[i], typeof jonasDataArray[i]);
    }
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    Jonas string
    Schmedtmann string
    ```
    
    (The loop stops when it encounters the number `46`, so `46` itself and subsequent elements are not printed by this specific `console.log`.)
    

The transcript notes, "this might not sound very practical, but believe me there are some important use cases for continue and break." However, "the most important takeaway from this lecture, is definitely to understand, how we can loop through a race using this kind of logic here [ `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++)` ]."
