Okay, here's a document summarizing basic array operations (methods) in JavaScript based on your transcript, followed by my own brief overview.

## Basic Array Operations (Methods) in JavaScript (Based on Transcript)

JavaScript arrays come with built-in functions called **methods** that allow you to perform common operations on them. The instructor describes methods as "array operations basically" and notes that "push is essentially a function... we call that function directly on the friends array."

Let's start with an example array:



```JavaScript
const friends = ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter'];
console.log("Initial friends:", friends);
// Output: Initial friends: (3) ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter']
```

### Adding Elements

1. push() method:
    
    This method "adds elements to the end of an array."
    
    "The push function does return a value and the value that it returns is the length of the new array."
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    const newLength = friends.push('Jay'); // Add 'Jay' to the end
    console.log("After push('Jay'):", friends);      // Output: (4) ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter', 'Jay']
    console.log("New length from push:", newLength); // Output: 4
    ```
    
    The instructor mentions that "this actually changed, so it mutated the original array".
    
2. unshift() method:
    
    This method "add elements to the beginning of the array."
    
    "Just like the push method, the unshift method also returns the length of the new array."
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    friends.unshift('John'); // Add 'John' to the beginning
    console.log("After unshift('John'):", friends); // Output: (5) ['John', 'Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter', 'Jay']
    ```
    

### Removing Elements

1. pop() method:
    
    This is "basically the opposite of the push method. So this means that pop will remove the last element of the array."
    
    "This one doesn't return the length of the new array but instead, it returns the removed element."
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    const poppedElement = friends.pop(); // Removes 'Jay' (the last element)
    console.log("After pop():", friends);           // Output: (4) ['John', 'Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter']
    console.log("Popped element:", poppedElement); // Output: Jay
    ```
    
2. shift() method:
    
    This method will "remove the first element from the array."
    
    "This method here will return the element that was removed."
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    const shiftedElement = friends.shift(); // Removes 'John' (the first element)
    console.log("After shift():", friends);           // Output: (3) ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter']
    console.log("Shifted element:", shiftedElement); // Output: John
    ```
    

### Checking for Elements

1. indexOf() method:
    
    This method "tells us in which position a certain element is in the array... this should return the index at which this element is located."
    
    "If we try the same thing for an element that is not in there... we will get minus one."
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Resetting friends array for clarity in indexOf/includes examples
    const currentFriends = ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter'];
    console.log("indexOf 'Steven':", currentFriends.indexOf('Steven')); // Output: 1
    console.log("indexOf 'Bob':", currentFriends.indexOf('Bob'));       // Output: -1
    ```
    
2. includes() method (ES6):
    
    This is "a very similar method to the indexOf, but which is a bit more modern and in my opinion also more useful."
    
    "includes, instead of returning the index of the element will simply return true if the element is in the array and false if it's not."
    
    Importantly, "this method actually uses strict equality for this check," meaning it does not perform type coercion.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    console.log("includes 'Steven':", currentFriends.includes('Steven')); // Output: true
    console.log("includes 'Bob':", currentFriends.includes('Bob'));       // Output: false
    
    currentFriends.push(23); // Add a number to the array: ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter', 23]
    console.log("Array with number:", currentFriends);
    console.log("includes 23 (number):", currentFriends.includes(23));       // Output: true
    console.log("includes '23' (string):", currentFriends.includes('23')); // Output: false (due to strict equality)
    ```
    
    The `includes()` method is very useful for conditionals: "we can use the include method to write conditionals."
    
    
    
    ```JavaScrip
    if (currentFriends.includes('Steven')) {
      console.log('You have a friend called Steven');
    } else {
      console.log('Steven is not in your friends list.');
    }
    // Output: You have a friend called Steven
    ```
    

The instructor concludes by saying, "there are many more useful methods for manipulating arrays. But for now, I just wanted to show you the most basic ones."

## My Brief Overview of Basic Array Methods

Array methods are like built-in tools or special functions that are specifically designed to work with arrays. They save you from having to write common array manipulation logic from scratch and make your code cleaner and more expressive.

Here's a simple way to think about the ones covered:

- **Adding Items:**
    
    - `push()`: Sticks new items on the **end** of the list.
    - `unshift()`: Adds new items to the **front** of the list.
- **Removing Items:**
    
    - `pop()`: Takes an item off the **end** of the list.
    - `shift()`: Takes an item off the **front** of the list.
- **Finding & Checking Items:**
    
    - `indexOf()`: Tells you the **position (index number)** of an item. If it's not there, it tells you `-1`.
    - `includes()`: Gives a simple **yes/no (true/false)** answer to whether an item exists in the list. It's very direct for checking presence.

**Key Things to Remember:**

1. **Attached to Arrays:** These methods are "called directly on" the array variable itself, using a dot (e.g., `myArray.push('newItem')`).
2. **Mutation:** Many of these basic methods (like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`) directly change or "mutate" the original array.
3. **Return Values:** These methods often "return" something useful:
    - `push` and `unshift` return the new length of the array.
    - `pop` and `shift` return the item that was removed.
    - `indexOf` returns the index or `-1`.
    - `includes` returns `true` or `false`.

Understanding these basic methods is a great starting point for effectively working with lists of data in JavaScript. As you progress, you'll discover many more powerful array methods for more complex tasks like transforming, filtering, and iterating over arrays.
