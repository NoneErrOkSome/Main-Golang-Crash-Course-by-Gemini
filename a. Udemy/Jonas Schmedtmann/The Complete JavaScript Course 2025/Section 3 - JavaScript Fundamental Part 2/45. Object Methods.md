## A Comprehensive Guide to JavaScript Object Methods

JavaScript objects are more than just collections of data; they can also encapsulate behavior through **methods**. Methods are functions associated with an object, allowing the object to perform actions, often on its own data. This guide explores the definition, invocation, and advanced usage of object methods, drawing from concepts in "JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 2."

### Defining and Understanding Object Methods

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they are treated like any other value. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and, importantly, stored as properties within objects. **"Any function that is attached to an object is called a method."** This means a method is essentially a property whose value is a function.

To define a method directly within an object literal, a **function expression** is required. This is because the value assigned to a property key must be an expression. Standard function declarations (which begin with `function methodName() {}`) are statements and cannot be directly used as property values in this context. The transcript clarifies: **"we could have not used a function declaration here... that would not work... here, we need an expression."**

Consider the `jonas` object from your course materials:



```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'],
  hasDriversLicense: true,

  // Method definition using a function expression
  calcAge: function(birthYearParam) { // Initially takes birthYear as a parameter
    return 2037 - birthYearParam;
  }
};
```

Here, `calcAge` is a method. The key is `calcAge`, and its value is the function expression `function(birthYearParam) { ... }`.

### Invoking Object Methods

Once defined, a method is called to execute its code. This is achieved by using the object's name followed by the method name and parentheses `()`, which may include arguments. Both dot notation and bracket notation can be used.



```JavaScript
// Continuing with the 'jonas' object
// Dot notation
let ageFromMethod = jonas.calcAge(1991); // Passing argument
console.log("Age (dot notation):", ageFromMethod); // Output: 46

// Bracket notation (key must be a string)
ageFromMethod = jonas['calcAge'](1991);
console.log("Age (bracket notation):", ageFromMethod); // Output: 46
```

The invocation process involves first accessing the method property (which yields the function value) and then executing that function using the parentheses. As the transcript explains, **"`jonas.calcAge` is computed. And so this here will become the function value. And then with the parenthesis, we call that function value."**

### The Role of the `this` Keyword within Methods

A powerful feature available within object methods (excluding arrow functions, which have different `this` behavior) is the `this` keyword. **"In every method, JavaScript gives us access to a special variable called `this`."** Crucially, **"The `this` key word or the `this` variable is basically equal to the object on which the method is called, or in other words, it is equal to the object calling the method."**

This allows a method to dynamically refer to the object it belongs to, enabling access to other properties of that same object without needing to pass them as parameters or hardcode the object's variable name.



```JavaScript
const jonasDetails = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  birthYear: 1991,
  // ... other properties

  calcAge: function() {
    // 'this' refers to 'jonasDetails' when 'jonasDetails.calcAge()' is called
    console.log("Value of 'this' inside calcAge:", this);
    return 2037 - this.birthYear; // Accesses jonasDetails.birthYear via 'this'
  }
};

const currentAge = jonasDetails.calcAge();
console.log(`${jonasDetails.firstName}'s current age: ${currentAge}`); // Output: Jonas's current age: 46
```

Using `this` is preferable to hardcoding the object's name (e.g., `jonasDetails.birthYear`) within the method. If the variable holding the object reference changes (e.g., `let person = jonasDetails; person.calcAge();`), `this` will correctly refer to `person` (which is the `jonasDetails` object), whereas a hardcoded `jonasDetails.birthYear` might break if `jonasDetails` was, for example, reassigned or out of scope.

### Methods Creating or Modifying Object Properties

Methods are not limited to reading an object's properties; they can also create new properties or modify existing ones on the object they belong to. This is typically done using `this.propertyName = value;`. A common use case is to calculate a value once, store it as a property, and then retrieve this stored property for subsequent accesses, enhancing efficiency.

The transcript notes: **"what we can do is to just calculate the age once, then store it in the object, and then when we need it at a later point, we can then just retrieve the age as a property from the object."**



```JavaScript
// Example from your "Fundamentals-Part-2/final/script.js"
const jonasProfile = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'],
  hasDriversLicense: true,

  calcAge: function () { // Method to calculate and store age
    this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear; // Creates 'this.age' property
    return this.age;
  }
  // ... other methods
};

console.log(jonasProfile.calcAge()); // Calculates and stores .age; Output: 46
console.log("Age property on object:", jonasProfile.age); // Accesses stored .age; Output: 46

// A similar pattern is used in Coding Challenge #3 for BMI calculation
const mark = {
  fullName: 'Mark Miller',
  mass: 78,
  height: 1.69,
  calcBMI: function () {
    this.bmi = this.mass / this.height ** 2; // Calculates and stores 'this.bmi'
    return this.bmi;
  }
};
mark.calcBMI();
console.log("Mark's BMI property:", mark.bmi);
```

This technique ensures that a potentially complex calculation is performed only once.

### Interaction Between Methods: One Method Calling Another

Methods within the same object can call each other using the `this` keyword. This promotes better organization by allowing complex methods to delegate tasks to other, more specialized methods within the same object.

Your course transcript includes a `getSummary` method that calls `this.calcAge()`:



```JavaScript
const jonasData = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: 'teacher',
  hasDriversLicense: true,

  calcAge: function() { // Assumes age is not yet stored, or recalculates
    this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear;
    return this.age;
  },

  getSummary: function() {
    // "this.calcAge will call this other method and this will then return the age."
    return `${this.firstName} is a ${this.calcAge()}-year old ${this.job}, and he has ${this.hasDriversLicense ? 'a' : 'no'} driver's license.`;
  }
};

console.logjonasData.getSummary());
// Output: Jonas is a 46-year old teacher, and he has a driver's license.
```

Here, `getSummary` relies on `calcAge` to ensure the age is available, demonstrating internal method interaction.

### Object Methods and the Broader JavaScript Ecosystem: Array Methods

The concept of methods extends beyond user-defined objects. Built-in JavaScript constructs, like arrays, are also specialized objects that come with their own set of methods. The transcript points out: **"arrays are actually also objects, they are just a special kind of object. And so they have functions, or in other words they have methods that we can use to manipulate them like push, pop, shift and unshift and many more."**

When you use `myArray.push('newItem')`, you are invoking the `push` method on the `myArray` object. This is analogous to calling `jonas.calcAge()` on the `jonas` object.

In essence, object methods empower objects to be more than passive data containers. They allow objects to encapsulate both data (properties) and the behavior (methods) that operates on that data, a fundamental principle in many programming paradigms. Understanding how to define and use methods, especially with the `this` keyword, is crucial for building more complex and well-structured JavaScript applications.
