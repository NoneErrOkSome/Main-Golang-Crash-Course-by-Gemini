## JavaScript Functions: Lesson FAQ ❓

Here are some frequently asked questions based on the concepts covered in the lesson about JavaScript functions.

---

### Q1: What is a function in JavaScript, and why is it described as a "fundamental concept"?

A:

A function in JavaScript is described as a "reusable blocks of code that can be executed multiple times." It's fundamental because functions help in "organizing code, making it more maintainable and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle." Essentially, they allow you to write a piece of logic once and then use it whenever and wherever you need it in your program.

---

### Q2: How do I define a simple function that just performs an action, like printing something?

A:

You define a simple function using the function keyword, followed by a name you choose for the function, then parentheses (), and finally a block of code (the function body) enclosed in curly braces {}.



```JavaScript
// 1. Defining a simple function (no input, no output value)
function logger() {
  console.log('My name is Jonas');
}
```

This `logger` function, for example, is defined to execute the `console.log` statement inside its body.

---

### Q3: I've defined a function. How do I actually make it run and do its job?

A:

To make a function run, you need to "call" or "invoke" it. This is done by writing the function's name followed by parentheses ().



```JavaScript
function logger() {
  console.log('My name is Jonas');
}

// 2. Calling / running / invoking the function
logger(); // This line executes the code inside logger()
logger(); // Calls it again
logger(); // And again
// Each call will output: My name is Jonas
```

---

### Q4: What happens if a function, like the `logger` example, doesn't have a `return` statement? Does it return anything?

A:

Yes. The lesson states: "If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns undefined." So, while the logger function's main purpose is to execute console.log(), if you were to try and capture its result, you'd get undefined.



```JavaScript
function logger() {
  console.log('My name is Jonas');
}

const resultOfLogger = logger();
console.log(resultOfLogger); // Output: undefined (after "My name is Jonas" is logged)
```

---

### Q5: How can I make my functions more flexible by allowing them to accept different inputs each time they are called?

A:

You can make functions more flexible by defining them with parameters. Parameters are "variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the input values." When you call the function, you provide arguments, which are "the actual values passed to the function... These values are assigned to the parameters."



```JavaScript
// 'apples' and 'oranges' are PARAMETERS
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
  return juice;
}

// When calling, 5 and 0 are ARGUMENTS.
// Inside the function, 'apples' will be 5, and 'oranges' will be 0.
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(appleJuice); // Output: Juice with 5 apples and 0 oranges.

// 2 and 4 are ARGUMENTS for this call.
const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice); // Output: Juice with 2 apples and 4 oranges.
```

---

### Q6: Can you clarify the difference between a 'parameter' and an 'argument'?

**A:**

- **Parameters:** These are the names you list in the function's definition (inside the parentheses). They are like empty boxes or placeholders waiting to receive values. For example, in `function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges)`, `apples` and `oranges` are parameters.
- **Arguments:** These are the actual, concrete values you provide to the function when you call it. For example, in `fruitProcessor(5, 0)`, `5` and `0` are the arguments. The argument `5` is assigned to the parameter `apples`, and `0` is assigned to `oranges` for that specific function call.

---

### Q7: How does a function send a result or a calculated value back to the part of my code that called it?

A:

A function sends a value back using the return statement. The lesson explains: "When a return statement is executed, the function stops executing and the specified value is 'returned' to the place where the function was called."



```JavaScript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum; // The value of 'sum' is sent back
}

const mySum = calculateSum(10, 5); // The call to calculateSum(10, 5) is replaced by the returned value (15)
console.log(mySum); // Output: 15
```

---

### Q8: What happens to the function's execution immediately after a `return` statement is encountered?

A:

When a return statement is executed, "the function stops executing." Any code within the function that appears after the return statement (in the same block of execution) will not be run.



```JavaScript
function exampleWithReturn(value) {
  if (value > 0) {
    return "Positive";
    console.log("This won't be printed if value is positive."); // Unreachable
  }
  return "Not positive (or zero)"; // This return executes if the 'if' condition is false
}

console.log(exampleWithReturn(5));  // Output: Positive
console.log(exampleWithReturn(0));  // Output: Not positive (or zero)
```

---

### Q9: If a function returns a value, how can I use that value in my code?

A:

There are a couple of common ways:

1. **Capture it in a variable:** You can assign the result of the function call to a variable.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    function multiply(x, y) {
      return x * y;
    }
    const product = multiply(6, 7); // 'product' now holds 42
    console.log(product);           // Output: 42
    ```
    
2. **Use it directly in an expression or another function call:**
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    function createGreeting(name) {
      return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
    console.log(createGreeting("Alice")); // Returned value used directly by console.log()
                                        // Output: Hello, Alice!
    
    const finalMessage = createGreeting("Bob") + " How are you?";
    console.log(finalMessage);          // Output: Hello, Bob! How are you?
    ```
    

---

### Q10: Does the code inside a function run automatically as soon as I define the function?

A:

No. The lesson states: "If a function is defined but never called, the code inside its body will never run." Defining a function is like creating a recipe; the recipe does nothing until you actually decide to cook (call the function).



```JavaScript
function showMessage() {
  console.log("This message is from showMessage.");
}
// At this point, "This message is from showMessage." has NOT been printed.

showMessage(); // NOW the code inside showMessage runs.
// Output: This message is from showMessage.
```

---

### Q11: The lesson mentions "built-in functions." What are those?

A:

Built-in functions are functions that are already part of the JavaScript language itself, provided for you to use without needing to define them. The lesson gives two examples:

- **`console.log()`**: You've been using this to print messages to the console. It's a built-in function that takes arguments (what you want to print).
- **`Number()`**: This is a built-in function that "takes an argument (e.g., a string) and attempts to convert it into a number, then returns that number."



```JavaScript
// Using the built-in Number() function
const stringValue = "123";
const numericValue = Number(stringValue);
console.log(numericValue);        // Output: 123 (as a number)
console.log(typeof numericValue); // Output: number
```

These built-in functions work similarly to the functions you define yourself: you call them with arguments, and they can return values.
