Okay, here's an FAQ based on the lesson about accessing and modifying object properties using dot and bracket notation.

## JavaScript Objects: Accessing & Modifying Properties - FAQ ðŸ”‘

This FAQ covers common questions about using dot (`.`) and bracket (`[]`) notation to interact with object properties.

---

### Q1: How do I get a value (property) from an object if I know its exact name?

A:

The most straightforward way is using dot notation. The instructor explains: "The first way of getting a property from an object is by using the dot notation and that is very straight forward... All we have to do is to write Jonas.lastName".

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46, // Assuming 2037 - 1991
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
};

console.log(jonas.lastName);  // Output: Schmedtmann
console.log(jonas.firstName); // Output: Jonas
```

The dot (`.`) is an "operator which will go to this object and then retrieve to property with the name that we specified".

---

### Q2: Is there another way to get a property from an object?

A:

Yes, you can also use bracket notation. "Here we need to specify a string with the property name. So with the key".

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46,
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
};

console.log(jonas['lastName']); // Output: Schmedtmann
console.log(jonas['job']);      // Output: teacher
```

---

### Q3: What's the main difference between dot (`.`) and bracket (`[]`) notation when getting properties?

A:

The "big difference between these two here is that in the bracket notation here, we can actually put any expression that we'd like, so we don't have to explicitly write the string here, but instead we can compute it from some operation because remember that an operation is basically an expression."1 With dot notation, "we have to use the real final property name and not a computed property name."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46
};

const nameKeyPart = 'Name';

// Bracket notation with a computed property name
console.log(jonas['first' + nameKeyPart]); // Computes to 'firstName', then accesses jonas['firstName']
                                           // Output: Jonas
console.log(jonas['last' + nameKeyPart]);  // Output: Schmedtmann

// Dot notation cannot use a computed property name like that:
// console.log(jonas.('first' + nameKeyPart)); // This would be a syntax error.
// console.log(jonas.'first' + nameKeyPart); // Also incorrect
```

---

### Q4: So, when should I use dot notation and when should I use bracket notation for accessing properties?

A:

The instructor gives this guideline: "When we need to first compute the property name, like we did here with the first and last name, then of course we have to use the bracket notation in any other case, just use the dot notation, which looks a lot2 cleaner and it's also easier to use".3

- **Use dot notation:** When the property name is fixed, known, and a valid JavaScript identifier (e.g., no spaces, not starting with a number). It's generally preferred for its readability.
- **Use bracket notation:** When the property name is dynamic (e.g., stored in a variable, or the result of an expression), or if the property name itself contains spaces, hyphens, or other special characters that aren't valid in dot notation.

---

### Q5: How can I use a variable to tell an object which property I want to access? (e.g., based on user input)

A:

This is a prime use case for bracket notation. If you have the desired property name stored in a variable, you put that variable inside the brackets.

JavaScript

```
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46,
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
};

// Simulate getting input from the user. prompt() returns a string.
// const interestedIn = prompt('What do you want to know about Jonas? Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job, and friends');
let interestedIn = 'job'; // For demonstration, let's say user chose 'job'

// If we try dot notation with the variable name:
// console.log(jonas.interestedIn); // This looks for a property LITERALLY named "interestedIn"
                                  // Output would be: undefined

// Using bracket notation, the variable's VALUE is used as the key:
console.log(jonas[interestedIn]); // If interestedIn is 'job', this becomes jonas['job']
                                  // Output: teacher
```

The instructor explains that with `jonas.interestedIn`, "Jonas does not have a property called 'interestedIn', right? And so therefore the result of trying to access 'interestedIn' on Jonas is undefined." With bracket notation `jonas[interestedIn]`, "JavaScript will now come here and replace 'interestedIn' with the actual value of the variable and then that's the one that will be looked up on the4 Jonas object."

---

### Q6: What happens if I try to access a property that doesn't exist in an object?

A:

"Undefined is what we get when we try to access a property on an object that does not exist."

JavaScript

```
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  job: 'teacher'
};

console.log(jonas.age);        // Output: undefined (age property doesn't exist)
console.log(jonas['location']); // Output: undefined (location property doesn't exist)
```

---

### Q7: How can I check if a property exists or handle cases where it might not, before trying to use its value?

A:

You can use an if statement. Since accessing a non-existent property returns undefined (which is a falsy value), you can check the result of the property access directly in a condition.

JavaScript

```
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46,
  job: 'teacher'
};

let propertyToFind = 'job'; // User wants to know the job
// propertyToFind = 'location'; // User wants to know location (which doesn't exist)

if (jonas[propertyToFind]) { // If jonas[propertyToFind] has a truthy value (i.e., not undefined)
  console.log(jonas[propertyToFind]);
} else {
  console.log(`Wrong request! Property '${propertyToFind}' not found. Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job, and friends`);
}
// If propertyToFind is 'job', Output: teacher
// If propertyToFind is 'location', Output: Wrong request! Property 'location' not found...
```

The instructor explains: "if this value exists, then it is a truthy value... Now, if one of these properties was actually empty or zero, we would then go to the else block, but let's not account for that here... So for example, with location, we then get undefined and so in this case, Jonas 'interested in' is undefined, which is false and therefore we would go to the else block."

### Q8: How do I add a new property to an existing object or change an existing one?

A:

You can use both dot and bracket notation with the assignment operator (=). If the property doesn't exist, it will be added. If it does exist, its value will be updated.

JavaScript

```
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann'
};
console.log("Before adding:", jonas);

// Adding new properties
jonas.location = 'Portugal';         // Using dot notation
jonas['twitter'] = '@jonasschmedtman'; // Using bracket notation

// Modifying an existing property
jonas.firstName = 'Jonathan';

console.log("After adding/modifying:", jonas);
/*
Output:
Before adding: { firstName: 'Jonas', lastName: 'Schmedtmann' }
After adding/modifying: {
  firstName: 'Jonathan',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  location: 'Portugal',
  twitter: '@jonasschmedtman'
}
*/
```

### Q9: In the challenge solution `console.log(`${jonas.firstName} has ${jonas.friends.length} friends...`);`, how does `jonas.friends.length` work?

A:

This works due to operator precedence and the nature of the properties. The member access operators (dot . and bracket []) have high precedence and are typically left-to-right associative.

1. `jonas.friends`: First, JavaScript evaluates `jonas.friends`. This accesses the `friends` property of the `jonas` object. The value of `jonas.friends` is an array (e.g., `['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']`).
2. `(result of jonas.friends).length`: Then, the `.length` property is accessed on the result of the first step (which is the array). Arrays have a `length` property.

The instructor states: "jonas.friends. And so this is our array, right? And so on this array, we can now ask for the length... you can also start to understand that the dot length is just a property that is available on all arrays."

Similarly for jonas.friends[0]:

1. `jonas.friends` is evaluated to get the array.
2. Then `[0]` is applied to that array to get its first element.

"They are executed left to right. And therefore the first thing that JavaScript does is `Jonas.friends`. And so essentially, this will then be replaced with the array and then on that array is where the `dot length` is then applied".
