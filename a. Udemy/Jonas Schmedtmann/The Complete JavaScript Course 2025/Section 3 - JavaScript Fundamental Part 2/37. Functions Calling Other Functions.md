You can call one JavaScript function from within another function. This is a common practice that helps in organizing code, making it more modular, and adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.

## Functions Calling Other Functions

Let's illustrate this with an example of a `fruitProcessor` that first needs to cut fruits into smaller pieces before making juice.

### 1. The Helper Function: `cutFruitPieces`

First, we define a function whose job is to take a fruit count and return the number of pieces it would be cut into.



```JavaScript
// This function will receive a fruit
// and return the fruit cut in, for example, four pieces.
function cutFruitPieces(fruit) {
  return fruit * 4; // If we get 2 apples, it will return 8 pieces.
}
```

### 2. The Main Function: `fruitProcessor`

The `fruitProcessor` function will receive a certain number of apples and oranges. Inside this function, it will use the `cutFruitPieces` function to process both the apples and oranges before creating the juice string.



```JavaScript
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  // We're gonna use our newly created machine (cutFruitPieces)
  // to cut the received apples and oranges into pieces.
  const applePieces = cutFruitPieces(apples);   // Calling one function inside of another function
  const orangePieces = cutFruitPieces(oranges); // Called again with oranges

  const juice = `Juice with ${applePieces} pieces of apple and ${orangePieces} pieces of orange.`;
  return juice;
}
```

### 3. Calling the Main Function and Data Flow

When `fruitProcessor` is called, it, in turn, calls `cutFruitPieces`.



```JavaScript
// Calling the fruitProcessor function with arguments two and three
const myJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 3);
console.log(myJuice);
// Output: Juice with 8 pieces of apple and 12 pieces of orange.
```

**Data Flow Explanation (as per instructor):**

1. `fruitProcessor(2, 3)` is called.
2. Inside `fruitProcessor`, the `apples` parameter becomes `2` and `oranges` becomes `3`.
3. The `cutFruitPieces(apples)` line is executed.
    - The value of `apples` (`2`) becomes the argument for `cutFruitPieces`.
    - Inside `cutFruitPieces`, the `fruit` parameter becomes `2`.
    - `fruit * 4` (which is `2 * 4`) calculates `8`.
    - `cutFruitPieces` returns `8`.
4. This returned value `8` is then stored in the `applePieces` variable within `fruitProcessor`.
5. The same process happens for `oranges`: `cutFruitPieces(3)` is called, `fruit` becomes `3`, `3 * 4` is `12`, which is returned and stored in `orangePieces`.
6. The `juice` string is constructed using `applePieces` (8) and `orangePieces` (12).
7. The `juice` string is returned by `fruitProcessor`.
8. This final string is assigned to `myJuice` and then logged to the console.

The instructor emphasizes taking a moment "to understand exactly how the data flows from one function to another."

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Modularity**: "It's very common for one function to call another function." This separates concerns, making each function responsible for a specific task.
- **DRY Principle**: If the cutting logic changes (e.g., fruits are now cut into 3 pieces instead of 4), you only need to update the `cutFruitPieces` function.


```javascript
// Example of changing the cutting logic:
function updatedCutFruitPieces(fruit) {
return fruit * 3; // Now cuts into 3 pieces
}

function updatedFruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
const applePieces = updatedCutFruitPieces(apples);
const orangePieces = updatedCutFruitPieces(oranges);
const juice = `Juice (3-piece cut) with ${applePieces} pieces of apple and ${orangePieces} pieces of orange.`;
return juice;
}

const newJuice = updatedFruitProcessor(2, 3);
console.log(newJuice);
// Output: Juice (3-piece cut) with 6 pieces of apple and 9 pieces of orange.
```

The instructor notes, "if the fruit was now only cut in three pieces all you have to do is to change it here and that's it." This avoids having to change the logic in multiple places if it were duplicated.
