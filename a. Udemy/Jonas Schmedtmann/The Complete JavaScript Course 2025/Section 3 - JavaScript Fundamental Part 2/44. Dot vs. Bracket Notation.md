Okay, let's explore how to get and change data within JavaScript objects using dot and bracket notation, with plenty of code examples.

First, let's re-establish our `jonas` object from the previous lesson:



```JavaScript
const jonas = {
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 2037 - 1991,
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
};
console.log("Initial Jonas Object:", jonas);
/*
Output will be similar to (properties might be alphabetized in console):
{
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46,
  job: 'teacher',
  friends: [ 'Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven' ]
}
*/
```

The instructor mentioned that "the order of properties does not matter" for retrieval because "we simply get the properties from the object using the property name itself."

## Retrieving Data from Objects

There are two main ways to access properties of an object:

### 1. Dot Notation (`.`)

This is often the more straightforward way when you know the exact property name.



```JavaScript
console.log("--- Dot Notation ---");
console.log(jonas.lastName);  // Output: Schmedtmann
console.log(jonas.firstName); // Output: Jonas
console.log(jonas.age);       // Output: 46
```

The `.` is an operator that accesses the property with the specified name on the object.

### 2. Bracket Notation (`[]`)

With bracket notation, the property name (key) is passed as a string inside the brackets.



```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- Bracket Notation ---");
console.log(jonas['lastName']);  // Output: Schmedtmann
console.log(jonas['firstName']); // Output: Jonas
console.log(jonas['age']);       // Output: 46
```

Key Advantage of Bracket Notation: Using Expressions

The "big difference" is that "in the bracket notation here, we can actually put any expression that we'd like." This means the property name can be computed.



```JavaScript
const nameKeyPart = 'Name';
// We compute the property name string: 'first' + 'Name' = 'firstName'
console.log(jonas['first' + nameKeyPart]); // Output: Jonas
console.log(jonas['last' + nameKeyPart]);  // Output: Schmedtmann

// This would NOT work with dot notation:
// console.log(jonas.('first' + nameKeyPart)); // SyntaxError
// With dot notation, "we have to use the real final property name and not a computed property name."
```

**When to Use Which for Retrieval:**

- Use **dot notation** when the property name is known, fixed, and a valid identifier (no spaces, special characters, doesn't start with a number). It's generally cleaner and easier to type.
- Use **bracket notation** when the property name is computed dynamically (e.g., from a variable or an expression), or if the property name contains spaces, special characters, or is a reserved keyword (though it's best to avoid such keys if possible).

Example with prompt() (Demonstrating Bracket Notation's Power):

The prompt() function returns a string, which we can then use with bracket notation.



```JavaScript
// const interestedIn = prompt('What do you want to know about Jonas? Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job, and friends');
// For non-interactive demonstration, let's simulate the prompt:
let interestedIn = 'job'; // Simulate user typing 'job'

console.log("\n--- Prompt Example ---");
console.log("User is interested in:", interestedIn);

// Using dot notation with the variable 'interestedIn' directly would NOT work as intended:
// console.log(jonas.interestedIn);
// This would output: undefined
// "undefined is what we get when we try to access a property on an object that does not exist.
// So Jonas does not have a property called 'interestedIn', right?"

// Bracket notation works because the variable 'interestedIn' is evaluated first:
console.log("Value for interestedIn:", jonas[interestedIn]); // Output: teacher (if interestedIn is 'job')

// Handling invalid input
interestedIn = 'location'; // Simulate user typing something not in the object
console.log("\nUser is now interested in:", interestedIn);

if (jonas[interestedIn]) { // If jonas[interestedIn] is a truthy value (not undefined)
  console.log("Found property:", jonas[interestedIn]);
} else {
  console.log(`Wrong request! '${interestedIn}' is not a valid property. Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job, and friends`);
}
// Output: Wrong request! 'location' is not a valid property...
```

The logic `if (jonas[interestedIn])` works because accessing a non-existent property returns `undefined`, which is a falsy value.

## Adding and Modifying Properties in Objects

You can add new properties or modify existing ones using either dot or bracket notation with the assignment operator (`=`).



```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- Adding/Modifying Properties ---");
// Adding a new property 'location' using dot notation
jonas.location = 'Portugal';

// Adding a new property 'twitter' using bracket notation
jonas['twitter'] = '@jonasschmedtman';

// Modifying an existing property
jonas.job = 'Lead Software Engineer';

console.log("Updated Jonas Object:", jonas);
/*
Output will show the jonas object with new 'location' and 'twitter' properties,
and the 'job' property updated.
{
  firstName: 'Jonas',
  lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
  age: 46,
  job: 'Lead Software Engineer', // Modified
  friends: [ 'Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven' ],
  location: 'Portugal',          // Added
  twitter: '@jonasschmedtman'    // Added
}
*/
```

The instructor notes, "here we could put any expression just like before" for the property name when using bracket notation for assignment.

## Challenge Example: Dynamic Sentence Construction

The challenge was to log: "Jonas has 3 friends, and his best friend is called Michael." dynamically.



```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- Challenge Solution ---");

// Jonas.friends is the array ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
// Jonas.friends.length is the length of that array (3)
// Jonas.friends[0] is the first element of that array ('Michael')

const sentence = `${jonas.firstName} has ${jonas.friends.length} friends, and his best friend is called ${jonas.friends[0]}.`;
console.log(sentence);
// Output: Jonas has 3 friends, and his best friend is called Michael.
```

The instructor explains the operator precedence: "dot notation... and... the brackets notation... both have a really high priority and both are left to right. And so that's why all of this works. So we have two dots here `Jonas.friends.length` and they are executed left to right. And therefore the first thing that JavaScript does is `Jonas.friends`. And so essentially, this will then be replaced with the array and then on that array is where the `dot length` is then applied and the same thing here. So first `Jonas.friends` is done. And then this one is also left to right and so from there we take element number zero."
