In JavaScript, you can define functions in several ways, with **function declarations** and **function expressions** being two primary methods. While they achieve similar outcomes, they have some differences in how they are defined and behave.

## Function Declarations

A function declaration uses the `function` keyword followed by the function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and the function body in curly braces.

- **Syntax**: `function functionName(param1, param2) { /* code to execute */ return value; }`  

```javascript
function functionName(param1, param2) {
  /* code to execute */
  return value;
}
```


- **Key Characteristic**: Function declarations are "hoisted." This means they are, in a sense, moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Therefore, you can call a function declaration _before_ it appears in your code.



```JavaScript
// Calling the function declaration BEFORE it's defined in the code
const age1FromDeclaration = calcAge1(1991);
console.log('Using Declaration (called before definition):', age1FromDeclaration); // Output: 46

// Function Declaration
function calcAge1(birthYear) {
  // const currentYear = 2037; // Assuming current year for calculation
  // return currentYear - birthYear;
  return 2037 - birthYear; // Simplified return
}

// Calling the function declaration AFTER it's defined (more common practice)
const age1Again = calcAge1(1985);
console.log('Using Declaration (called after definition):', age1Again); // Output: 52
```

In a function declaration, the instructor notes that "the parameter is again the kind of placeholder in the function and the argument is then the actual value that we use to fill in that placeholder".

## Function Expressions

A function expression involves creating a function (often an anonymous function, meaning it doesn't have a name directly after the `function` keyword) and assigning it to a variable. This variable then becomes the way to call the function.

- **Syntax**: `const variableName = function(param1, param2) { /* code to execute */ return value; };`
- **Key Characteristic**: Function expressions are **not** hoisted in the same way as declarations. You must define a function expression _before_ you can call it. Attempting to call it before definition will result in an error.
- The function part itself (`function(birthYear) { ... }`) is an expression, and "remember that an expression produces a value". This value (the function itself) is then stored in the variable.
- The instructor highlights that in JavaScript, "functions are actually just values," just like numbers or strings, which allows them to be stored in variables.



```JavaScript
// Function Expression
const calcAge2 = function (birthYear) {
  return 2037 - birthYear;
};

const age2FromExpression = calcAge2(1991);
console.log('Using Expression:', age2FromExpression); // Output: 46

// Attempting to call a function expression before its definition would cause an error:
// const age2Premature = calcAge3(1990); // This would throw: "Cannot access 'calcAge3' before initialization"
// const calcAge3 = function (birthYear) { return 2037 - birthYear; };
```

## Main Difference: Hoisting

The primary practical difference is hoisting:

- **Function Declarations**: Can be called before they are defined in the code.
- **Function Expressions**: Must be defined before they are called.

The instructor mentions a personal preference for function expressions because they can enforce a structure where functions are defined at the top of a script before being called, leading to "nicer and more structured" code. However, the choice between them is often a matter of personal preference or team convention. It's important to understand both as they each have their place in JavaScript.
