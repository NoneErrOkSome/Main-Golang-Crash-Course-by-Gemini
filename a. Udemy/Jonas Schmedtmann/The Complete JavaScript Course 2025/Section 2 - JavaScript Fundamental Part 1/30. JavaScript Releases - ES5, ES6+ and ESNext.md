## JavaScript Versions and Releases: A Historical Overview and Modern Practices

This document outlines the history of JavaScript, its versioning (releases), and how modern JavaScript is used today, including considerations for browser compatibility.

### I. History of JavaScript

- **1995:** Brendan Eich created the first version of JavaScript, initially called "Mocha," in 10 days for the Netscape Navigator browser.
- **1996:** Mocha was renamed to LiveScript, and then again to JavaScript, partly as a marketing tactic to leverage the popularity of Java. Microsoft launched Internet Explorer with a copied version of JavaScript called JScript.
- **1997:** To standardize the language due to competing versions, JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International, an independent standards organization. ECMA released ECMAScript 1 (ES1), the first official standard for the language.
    - "ECMAScript" refers to the standard, while "JavaScript" refers to the language as implemented in browsers.
- **2009:** ES5 was released, introducing significant new features after a period of complications.
- **2015 (June):** ES6 (officially ES2015) was launched, marking the biggest update to the language with many new features. This version is often referred to as ES6.
- **Post-2015:** ECMAScript adopted an annual release cycle. This means a new version with a smaller set of features is released each year (e.g., ES2016 or ES7, ES2017, etc.), making it easier to keep up with changes.

### II. Backwards Compatibility

- JavaScript maintains backwards compatibility all the way to ES1. This means code written in 1997 can still run in modern JavaScript engines.
- This is due to the "don't break the web" principle, where features are almost never removed, only added.
- While this ensures old websites continue to function, it means older bugs and quirks remain in the language. Modern JavaScript development focuses on using current features and avoiding these older issues.

### III. Forwards Compatibility

- JavaScript is **not** forwards compatible. Code written with future JavaScript features (e.g., hypothetical code from 2089) will not run in today's browsers because they don't understand these future features.

### IV. Using Modern JavaScript Today

1. **Development Phase:**
    - When building a site on your computer, use the most up-to-date version of a modern browser (e.g., Google Chrome) to ensure all current JavaScript features work.
2. **Production Phase:**
    - When your application is deployed and running in users' browsers, you cannot control which browser versions they use.
    - To ensure compatibility with older browsers, modern JavaScript code (ES6+) is often converted back to ES5 through **transpiling** (using tools like Babel) and **polyfilling**. ES5 is chosen as the target because it is fully supported in almost all browsers, down to Internet Explorer 9.

### V. JavaScript Release Terminology and Support

- **ES5:** Fully supported in all browsers today. It serves as the common target for transpilation.
- **ES6+ (ES2015 and beyond):** These are collectively referred to as "modern JavaScript." They are well-supported in all modern browsers. However, transpiling is still recommended for production to support users on older browsers. You can check feature support on sites like the ES6 compatibility table.
- **ESNext:** Refers to future releases of JavaScript (e.g., ES2021, ES2022). Browsers may start implementing features from ESNext proposals when they reach Stage 3 of the ECMAScript specification process, even before official release.

### VI. Approach to Learning in This Course

- The course teaches **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** from the beginning.
- It will also cover how certain things were done in **ES5** for several reasons:
    - To better understand how some modern features work "behind the scenes."
    - Many online tutorials and older codebases still use ES5.
    - Developers may encounter ES5 code in existing projects at jobs.
