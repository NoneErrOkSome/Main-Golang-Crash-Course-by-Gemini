Okay, here's a summary of the key concepts for declaring variables in JavaScript, focusing on best practices and conventions, with code examples:

## Declaring Variables in JavaScript: `let`, `const`, and `var` ðŸ”‘

JavaScript offers three keywords for declaring variables: `let`, `const` (both modern, introduced in ES6), and `var` (the older way). Understanding their differences and best practices is crucial for writing clean and robust code.

### `let`

- **Use Case**: For variables whose values **might change later** (reassignment or mutation).
- **Initialization**: Can be declared without an initial value (it will be `undefined` by default).
- **Best Practice**: Use `let` when you are certain that the variable's value will need to be updated during the execution of your program.



```JavaScript
// Use 'let' when a variable's value might change
let age = 30;
console.log(age); // 30

age = 31; // Reassigning the value (mutation)
console.log(age); // 31

let currentYear; // Declaring without an initial value is allowed
console.log(currentYear); // undefined

currentYear = 2025;
console.log(currentYear); // 2025
```

### `const`

- **Use Case**: For variables whose values are **not supposed to change** after they are initialized (immutable).
- **Initialization**: **Must be initialized** with a value upon declaration. You cannot declare an empty `const` variable.
- **Reassignment**: Trying to reassign a `const` variable will result in a `TypeError`.
- **Best Practice**: **Use `const` by default for all your variable declarations.** Only switch to `let` if you specifically know the variable's value needs to change. This helps prevent accidental reassignments and makes your code more predictable and less prone to bugs.



```JavaScript
// Use 'const' for values that should not change
const birthYear = 1991;
console.log(birthYear); // 1991

// birthYear = 1990; // This would cause a TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// const day; // This would cause a SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration.
```

### `var`

- **Use Case**: The old way of declaring variables (pre-ES6).
- **Behavior**: Allows reassignment, similar to `let` at first glance.
- **Best Practice**: **Completely avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript.** While it might seem similar to `let`, `var` has different scoping rules (it's function-scoped, whereas `let` and `const` are block-scoped). These differences can lead to subtle bugs and make code harder to reason about. You might encounter `var` in older codebases or tutorials.



```JavaScript
// 'var' is the old way and should be avoided in modern JavaScript
var job = "programmer";
console.log(job); // programmer

job = "teacher"; // Reassignment is allowed with var
console.log(job); // teacher
```

---

### Undeclared Variables (Implicit Globals)

- **Behavior**: JavaScript allows assigning a value to a variable name without using `let`, `const`, or `var`. This does **not** create a variable in the current scope but rather a property on the global object.
- **Best Practice**: **Never do this. Always properly declare your variables** using `let` or `const`. Creating implicit globals is considered a very bad practice and can lead to difficult-to-debug issues.



```JavaScript
// Avoid this bad practice:
// lastName = "Schmedtmann"; // This creates a global property, not a properly scoped variable.
// console.log(lastName);

// Always declare variables:
let city = "Lisbon";
const country = "Portugal";
```

### Summary of Best Practices ðŸŒŸ

1. **Default to `const`**: Always declare variables with `const` first.
2. **Use `let` sparingly**: Only use `let` if you are sure the variable's value needs to change. This minimizes variable mutations, which can be a source of bugs.
3. **Avoid `var`**: Do not use `var` for new JavaScript code.
4. **Always declare variables**: Never assign values to undeclared variable names.
