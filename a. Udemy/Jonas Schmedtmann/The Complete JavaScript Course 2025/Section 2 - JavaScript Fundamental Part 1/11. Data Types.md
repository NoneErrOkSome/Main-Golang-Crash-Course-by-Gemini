## JavaScript Data Types: Best Practices & Conventions üßë‚Äçüíª

In JavaScript, every value is either an **object** or a **primitive value**. This lecture focuses on primitive data types and how to work with them conventionally.

### Primitive Data Types

There are seven primitive data types:

1. **Number**: Represents numeric values.
    
    - **Convention**: All numbers are floating-point (they can have decimals, even if not explicitly written). There's no distinction between integers and decimals at the type level.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    let age = 23;       // Considered 23.0
    let price = 19.99;
    console.log(typeof age);   // "number"
    console.log(typeof price); // "number"
    ```
    
2. **String**: Represents textual data.
    
    - **Best Practice**: Always enclose strings in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. Without quotes, JavaScript will try to interpret the text as a variable name.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    let firstName = "Jonas"; // Double quotes
    let job = 'teacher';   // Single quotes
    
    // console.log(anotherName); // Error: anotherName is not defined if not quoted
    console.log(typeof firstName); // "string"
    ```
    
3. **Boolean**: Represents logical values: `true` or `false`.
    
    - **Convention**: Used for making decisions. Variables holding booleans often have descriptive names that imply a yes/no state.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    let javascriptIsFun = true;
    let isAdult = false;
    
    console.log(javascriptIsFun);       // true
    console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun); // "boolean"
    ```
    
4. **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
    
    - **Convention**: It's perfectly fine to declare a variable without an initial value. It will automatically have the value `undefined` and its type will also be `"undefined"`.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    let children;
    console.log(children);        // undefined
    console.log(typeof children); // "undefined"
    ```
    
5. **Null**: Also represents an "empty" or "unknown" value.
    
    - **Note**: While similar to `undefined`, it's used in different contexts, often intentionally assigned to signify "no value." A known quirk is that `typeof null` returns `"object"`, which is a bug that hasn't been fixed for legacy reasons.
    
    
    
    ```JavaScript
    let car = null;
    console.log(car);        // null
    console.log(typeof car); // "object" (this is the known quirk)
    ```
    
6. **Symbol** (ES2015): Represents a unique, immutable value. Less commonly used in everyday coding for beginners.
    
7. **BigInt** (ES2020): Represents integers larger than the `Number` type can safely hold.

### Dynamic Typing

JavaScript employs **dynamic typing**.

- **Convention/Best Practice**:
    - You do not need to manually specify the data type of a variable. JavaScript determines the type automatically when a value is assigned.
    - The **value** has a type, not the variable itself. Variables simply store these typed values.
    - You can change the type of value a variable holds later in your code. This is powerful but can also lead to bugs if not managed carefully.
    - When reassigning a variable, do **not** use `let` again. `let` is only for the initial declaration.



```JavaScript
let year = 1991;          // year is initially a number
console.log(typeof year); // "number"

year = "Nineteen Ninety One"; // Now, year holds a string
console.log(typeof year); // "string" (dynamic typing in action)
```

### Code Commenting

Comments are used to explain code or temporarily deactivate it.

- **Best Practice**:
    - **Single-line comments**: Start with `//`. JavaScript ignores everything after `//` on that line.
    - **Multi-line comments**: Start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything between these is ignored.
    - **Shortcut**: In many editors like VS Code, `Cmd + /` (Mac) or `Ctrl + /` (Windows) toggles comments.



```JavaScript
// This is a single-line comment explaining the next line
let score = 100;

/*
This is a
multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
let oldCode = 'some old code';
*/

// console.log(60 + 1 + 1); // This line is commented out and won't run
```

### The `typeof` Operator

Used to check the data type of a value.

- **Convention**: Very useful for debugging and understanding what type of data you are working with.



```JavaScript
console.log(typeof true);         // "boolean"
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun); // "boolean" (variable holding a boolean)
console.log(typeof 23);           // "number"
console.log(typeof "Jonas");      // "string"
console.log(typeof undefined);    // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null);         // "object" (the historical bug)
```

### Code Execution Order

- **Convention**: JavaScript code is generally executed from top to bottom. A variable must be declared before it can be used.



```JavaScript
// console.log(myVariable); // Error: Cannot access 'myVariable' before initialization

let myVariable = "Hello";
console.log(myVariable); // Works fine
```

By understanding these data types and adhering to conventions, you can write more readable, maintainable, and predictable JavaScript code.
