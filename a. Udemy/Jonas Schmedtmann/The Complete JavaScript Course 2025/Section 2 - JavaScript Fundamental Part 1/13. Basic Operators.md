Okay, here's a rundown of JavaScript operators, explained in a straightforward way:

Operators are special symbols or keywords that let you perform actions on your data (values and variables). Think of them as the verbs in your JavaScript sentences.

### Doing the Math ➕➖✖️➗

**Arithmetic operators** are for your basic calculations:

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds numbers.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts numbers.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies numbers.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides numbers.
- **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises a number to the power of another (e.g., `2 ** 3` is 2x2x2 = 8).

A good tip is to store frequently used or shared values (like a "current year" for age calculations) in a variable. This way, if it changes, you only update it in one spot.


```JavaScript
const currentYear = 2037;
const birthYearJonas = 1991;
const birthYearSarah = 2018;

let ageJonas = currentYear - birthYearJonas;
let ageSarah = currentYear - birthYearSarah;

console.log(ageJonas, ageSarah); // You can log multiple values!
console.log(ageJonas * 2, ageJonas / 10, 2 ** 3);
```

### Sticking Strings Together 🔗

The **plus operator (`+`)** has a double life! When used with strings, it joins them together (this is called concatenation).



```JavaScript
const firstName = "Jonas";
const lastName = "Schmedtmann";

// To get "Jonas Schmedtmann"
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName); // Notice the space string " "
```

### Giving Values to Variables (Assignment) 📝

**Assignment operators** are used to assign values to variables.

- The basic one is the **equals sign (`=`)**.
- There are also shorthand operators to make life easier when you're modifying a variable based on its current value:
    - `+=` (add and assign): `x += 5` is the same as `x = x + 5`
    - `-=` (subtract and assign)
    - `*=` (multiply and assign)
    - `/=` (divide and assign)
    - `++` (increment): Increases a variable by 1. `x++` is like `x = x + 1`.
    - `--` (decrement): Decreases a variable by 1. `x--` is like `x = x - 1`.



```JavaScript
let x = 10 + 5; // x becomes 15
x += 10;        // x is now 15 + 10 = 25
x *= 4;         // x is now 25 * 4 = 100
x++;            // x is now 101
x--;            // x is now 100
console.log(x);
```

### Comparing Things 🤔❓

**Comparison operators** compare two values and give you back a boolean result: `true` or `false`. These are super important for making decisions in your code.

- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)



```JavaScript
// Assuming ageJonas is 46 and ageSarah is 19 from earlier
console.log(ageJonas > ageSarah); // true

const isSarahFullAge = ageSarah >= 18; // Store the boolean result
console.log(isSarahFullAge);        // true
```

It's common practice to store the `true`/`false` result of a comparison in a variable if you need to use that outcome later.

### What Happens First? (Operator Precedence) 🚦

When you have multiple operators in one line, like `currentYear - 1991 > currentYear - 2018`, JavaScript doesn't just go from left to right. It has rules about which operators get calculated first (this is called operator precedence). For instance, math calculations often happen before comparisons. This ensures complex expressions are evaluated correctly, but the specifics of these rules are for another time!
