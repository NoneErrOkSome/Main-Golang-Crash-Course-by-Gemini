Okay, let's clarify the difference between **expressions** and **statements** in JavaScript. It can seem a bit fuzzy at first, but understanding the core distinction is helpful.

**Expressions: Producing a Value**

Think of an **expression** as any piece of JavaScript code that ultimately resolves to a single value. It's like a question that JavaScript can answer with a specific result.

- **Simple values are expressions:**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    1991;      // This number itself is an expression; it produces the value 1991.
    "Hello";   // This string is an expression; it produces the value "Hello".
    true;      // This boolean is an expression; it produces the value true.
    ```
    
- **Arithmetic operations are expressions:**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    3 + 4;     // This produces the value 7.
    20 * 2;    // This produces the value 40.
    ```
    
    Even just `3 + 4` by itself, without being part of a larger line, is an expression.
    
- **Logical operations are expressions:**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    true && false && !false; // This evaluates and produces a single boolean value (false).
    ```
    
- **Variable assignments can contain expressions (the part after the `=`):**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    let age = 2025 - 1990; // `2025 - 1990` is an expression that produces 35.
    ```
    
    A variable name itself, when used where a value is expected, also acts as an expression because it resolves to the value it holds.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    let myName = "Bard";
    console.log(myName); // `myName` here is an expression that produces "Bard".
    ```
    

The key idea is that an expression, when evaluated, "boils down" to a single value (be it a number, string, boolean, etc.).

**Statements: Performing an Action**

A **statement** is a larger piece of code that performs an action or a set of actions. Think of it as a complete instruction or a command given to the JavaScript engine. Statements don't necessarily produce a value themselves in the same way expressions do.

- **Declarations are statements:**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    let myVariable = 100;      // This whole line is a variable declaration statement.
    const PI = 3.14159;      // This is a constant declaration statement.
    function greet() {         // This whole function declaration is a statement.
        console.log("Hello!");
    }
    ```
    
    While `100` is an expression, the act of declaring `myVariable` and assigning `100` to it forms a statement.
    
- **Control flow structures are statements:**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    if (23 > 10) { // This entire if structure is a statement.
      const str = '23 is bigger'; // This line inside is also a statement.
    }
    ```
    
    The `if` statement itself doesn't produce a value like `7` or `true`. It _directs the flow_ of the program based on the evaluation of an expression (the condition `23 > 10`). Similarly, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `switch` statements are all statements.
    
- **A line of code ending with a semicolon is typically a statement:**
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    console.log("Executing an action"); // This is a statement.
    x = y + 5;                         // This assignment is a statement.
    ```
    

**The "Sentence vs. Word" Analogy**

The instructor used an analogy:

- **Expressions** are like the individual words or phrases that have meaning (produce a value).
- **Statements** are like complete sentences that convey a full instruction or action. A sentence is made up of words. Similarly, statements often _contain_ expressions.

For example, in the statement:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let message = "The sum is: " + (5 + 10);
```

- `5 + 10` is an expression (produces `15`).
- `"The sum is: "` is an expression (produces a string).
- `"The sum is: " + (5 + 10)` is a larger expression (produces `"The sum is: 15"`).
- The entire line `let message = ...;` is a variable declaration statement that performs the action of creating `message` and assigning it the value produced by the expression on the right.

**Why Does It Matter?**

JavaScript expects expressions in some places and statements in others.

- **Template Literals:** You can only embed _expressions_ inside `${...}` in a template literal, because it needs a value to insert into the string.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    const currentYear = 2025;
    const birthYear = 1990;
    // This works because `currentYear - birthYear` is an expression that produces a number.
    const anouncement = `I am ${currentYear - birthYear} years old.`;
    console.log(anouncement);
    
    // This would NOT work because an `if` statement doesn't produce a single value to insert.
    // const badAnouncement = `I am ${if (age > 18) { "adult" } else { "minor" }} years old.`; // Error!
    ```
    
    (For the "badAnouncement" scenario, you'd use a ternary operator, which _is_ an expression: `${age > 18 ? "adult" : "minor"}`)

**In a Nutshell:**

- **Expression:** Code that results in a value.
- **Statement:** Code that performs an action. Statements often include expressions.

Don't get too hung up on a super strict definition right now. The main takeaway is that expressions are about _values_, and statements are about _actions_. You'll develop a more intuitive feel for this as you write more JavaScript.
