You can use **logical operators** in JavaScript to combine multiple boolean conditions and make more complex decisions in your code. The main logical operators are **AND (`&&`)**, **OR (`||`)**, and **NOT (`!`)**.

## Logical Operators in Action

Let's explore how these operators work with a practical example of determining if someone should drive.

First, we'll define a few boolean variables representing different conditions:



```JavaScript
let hasDriversLicense = true;
let hasGoodVision = true;
let isTired = false; // Let's assume not tired initially for safe driving
```

### Basic AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) Operations

The AND (&&) operator returns true only if all conditions are true.

The OR (||) operator returns true if at least one condition is true.1



```JavaScript
console.log("--- Basic Logical Operations ---");

// AND example
console.log("hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision:", hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision);
// Output: true (because both are true)

let tempGoodVision = false; // Temporary change for demonstration
console.log("hasDriversLicense && tempGoodVision (false):", hasDriversLicense && tempGoodVision);
// Output: false (because tempGoodVision is false)

// OR example
console.log("hasDriversLicense || tempGoodVision (false):", hasDriversLicense || tempGoodVision);
// Output: true (because hasDriversLicense is still true)

console.log("tempGoodVision (false) || isTired (false):", tempGoodVision || isTired);
// Output: false (because both tempGoodVision and isTired are false in this specific check)
```

### The NOT (`!`) Operator

The **NOT (`!`)** operator inverts a boolean value. `!true` becomes `false`, and `!false` becomes `true`.



```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- NOT Operator ---");
console.log("!hasDriversLicense (initially true):", !hasDriversLicense); // Output: false
console.log("!isTired (initially false):", !isTired);         // Output: true
```

## Making Decisions with Combined Logic

Now, let's use these operators to decide if Sarah should drive. The conditions are:

1. She must have a driver's license.
2. She must have good vision.
3. She must **not** be tired.

We can combine these into a single `if` statement:



```JavaScript
console.log("\n--- Driving Decision Logic ---");

if (hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision && !isTired) {
  // !isTired is true if isTired is false (meaning she is NOT tired)
  console.log('Sarah is able to drive! à¸‚à¸±à¸šà¸£à¸–à¹„à¸”à¹‰à¹€à¸¥à¸¢! ðŸš—');
} else {
  console.log('Someone else should drive. ðŸ›‘');
}
// Current state: hasDriversLicense = true, hasGoodVision = true, isTired = false
// So, true && true && !false  =>  true && true && true  =>  true
// Output: Sarah is able to drive! à¸‚à¸±à¸šà¸£à¸–à¹„à¸”à¹‰à¹€à¸¥à¸¢! ðŸš—
```

Let's see what happens if one condition changes. Suppose Sarah is now tired:



```JavaScript
isTired = true; // Sarah is now tired
console.log("\n--- Driving Decision (Sarah is tired) ---");

if (hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision && !isTired) {
  // !isTired will be !true, which is false
  console.log('Sarah is able to drive! à¸‚à¸±à¸šà¸£à¸–à¹„à¸”à¹‰à¹€à¸¥à¸¢! ðŸš—');
} else {
  console.log('Someone else should drive. ðŸ›‘');
}
// Current state: hasDriversLicense = true, hasGoodVision = true, isTired = true
// So, true && true && !true  =>  true && true && false  =>  false
// Output: Someone else should drive. ðŸ›‘
```

If Sarah doesn't have a license:



```JavaScript
hasDriversLicense = false;
isTired = false; // Let's say she's not tired for this scenario
console.log("\n--- Driving Decision (No License) ---");

if (hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision && !isTired) {
  console.log('Sarah is able to drive! à¸‚à¸±à¸šà¸£à¸–à¹„à¸”à¹‰à¹€à¸¥à¸¢! ðŸš—');
} else {
  console.log('Someone else should drive. ðŸ›‘');
}
// Current state: hasDriversLicense = false, hasGoodVision = true, isTired = false
// So, false && true && !false  =>  false && true && true  =>  false
// Output: Someone else should drive. ðŸ›‘
```

By combining boolean variables with `&&`, `||`, and `!`, you can model complex conditions and control the flow of your program effectively.
