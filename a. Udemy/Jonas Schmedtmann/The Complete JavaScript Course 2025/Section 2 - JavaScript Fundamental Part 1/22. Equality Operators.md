Okay, let's explore how JavaScript handles checking if values are equal or different, using **equality operators**, and how to chain multiple conditions with **`else if`** blocks.

## Equality Operators: `===` vs. `==`

When you want to check if two values are the same, JavaScript provides a couple of ways to do it.

### Strict Equality (`===`)

The **strict equality operator (`===`)** checks if two values are equal _without performing any type coercion_. This means both the value and the data type must be the same for the operator to return `true`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let age = 18;

if (age === 18) {
  // This block executes because age (number 18) is strictly equal to 18 (number 18)
  console.log('You just became an adult! (Strict check)');
}

// If the if-block contains only one line of code, the curly braces {} are optional.
// However, it's generally good practice to always use them for clarity and to avoid errors
// if you later add more lines. For example:
// if (age === 18) console.log('Single line check works too!');

age = 19;
if (age === 18) {
  console.log('This will not print now.');
}
// No output, because 19 is not strictly equal to 18.

// Let's see the boolean results directly:
console.log("18 === 18:", 18 === 18);       // Output: true
console.log("18 === 19:", 18 === 19);       // Output: false
console.log("'18' === 18:", '18' === 18);   // Output: false (string '18' is not the same type as number 18)
```

**Key takeaway:** `===` is strict. No type conversion happens.

### Loose Equality (`==`)

The **loose equality operator (`==`)** checks if two values are equal _after attempting to convert them to a common type_ (type coercion).

JavaScript

```JavaScript
console.log("'18' == 18:", '18' == 18);     // Output: true (string '18' is coerced to number 18, then 18 == 18)
console.log("true == 1:", true == 1);       // Output: true (true is coerced to 1)
console.log("false == 0:", false == 0);     // Output: true (false is coerced to 0)
```

**Why You Should Avoid Loose Equality (`==`)**

The type coercion rules for `==` can be very confusing and lead to unexpected bugs that are hard to find.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let currentAge = 18;

// Using strict equality with a number
if (currentAge === 18) {
  console.log('Strict: Age is 18 (number)'); // This will run
}

// Using loose equality with a number
if (currentAge == 18) {
  console.log('Loose: Age is 18 (number)');  // This will also run
}

currentAge = '18'; // Now currentAge is a string

// Using strict equality with a string
if (currentAge === 18) {
  // This will NOT run because '18' (string) !== 18 (number)
  console.log('Strict: Age is 18 (string vs number) - WONT RUN');
}

// Using loose equality with a string
if (currentAge == 18) {
  // This WILL run because '18' (string) is coerced to 18 (number) for the comparison.
  console.log('Loose: Age is 18 (string vs number) - RUNS DUE TO COERCION');
}
```

**Best Practice:** **Always use the strict equality operator (`===`)**. If you need to compare values of different types, explicitly convert one of them to the desired type first (e.g., using `Number()`, `String()`) and then use `===`. Pretend `==` doesn't exist for most practical purposes.

## Getting User Input with `prompt()`

You can get input from a user in the browser using the `prompt()` function. It displays a dialog box with an optional message.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// const favoriteNumberString = prompt("What's your favorite number?");
// console.log(favoriteNumberString);
// console.log(typeof favoriteNumberString); // IMPORTANT: prompt() always returns a string (or null if cancelled)

// Let's simulate prompt for non-interactive demonstration:
let favoriteNumberString = "23"; // Simulating user input "23"
console.log("User input (as string):", favoriteNumberString);
console.log("Type of user input:", typeof favoriteNumberString);
```

**Important:** The value returned by `prompt()` is _always_ a string, even if the user types in numbers. If the user cancels the prompt, it returns `null`.

Now, let's use this with our equality checks:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const favNumberAsNumber = Number(favoriteNumberString); // Explicitly convert to number

if (favNumberAsNumber === 23) {
  console.log('Cool! 23 is an amazing number! (Strict check after conversion)');
} else {
  console.log('Your favorite number is not 23.');
}

// What if we used loose equality without conversion?
if (favoriteNumberString == 23) { // '23' == 23 -> true (due to coercion)
  console.log('Loose check: Cool! 23 is an amazing number! (Works due to coercion)');
}

// What if we used strict equality without conversion?
if (favoriteNumberString === 23) { // '23' === 23 -> false (string vs number)
  // This block would not execute
  console.log('Strict check (no conversion): This part will not run if input is "23".');
} else if (favoriteNumberString !== null) { // check if prompt was not cancelled
    console.log('Strict check (no conversion): Your favorite number (string "'+favoriteNumberString+'") is not the number 23.');
}
```

Again, to reliably use `===` with `prompt()` results that are intended to be numbers, convert the string to a number first.

---

## Chaining Conditions with `else if`

Sometimes you have more than two possible outcomes. You can chain multiple conditions using `else if`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Assuming favNumberAsNumber is the number converted from prompt
const someNumber = 7; // Let's simulate a number for this example

if (someNumber === 23) {
  console.log('Your number is 23!');
} else if (someNumber === 7) {
  console.log('Your number is 7, also a cool number!'); // This will execute
} else if (someNumber === 9) {
  console.log('Your number is 9!');
} else {
  console.log('Your number is not 23, 7, or 9.');
}
```

**How `else if` works:**

1. The first `if` condition is checked. If `true`, its block executes, and the rest of the `else if` / `else` chain is skipped.
2. If the first `if` is `false`, the next `else if` condition is checked. If `true`, its block executes, and the rest is skipped.
3. This continues for any subsequent `else if` blocks.
4. If all `if` and `else if` conditions are `false`, the final `else` block (if present) executes.

## Inequality Operators: `!==` vs. `!=`

Just as there are operators for equality, there are operators for inequality (checking if values are _different_).

- **Strict Inequality (`!==`)**: Returns `true` if the values are not equal _or_ are not of the same type (no type coercion). This is the preferred operator.
- **Loose Inequality (`!=`)**: Returns `true` if the values are not equal after attempting type coercion. Avoid this for the same reasons you avoid `==`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let anotherNumber = 10;

if (anotherNumber !== 23) { // 10 is not 23
  console.log(`Why not 23? Your number is ${anotherNumber}. (Strict inequality)`);
}

// Using the favoriteNumber example again:
if (favNumberAsNumber !== 23) {
    console.log(`Your favorite number (${favNumberAsNumber}) is not 23.`);
} else {
    console.log(`Your favorite number IS indeed 23!`);
}

console.log("'10' !== 10:", '10' !== 10); // Output: true (string '10' is different from number 10)
console.log("'10' != 10:", '10' != 10);   // Output: false (string '10' is coerced to number 10, then 10 == 10, so not different)
```

**Summary of Best Practice:**

- For equality, **always use `===` (strict equality)**.
- For inequality, **always use `!==` (strict inequality)**.
- If you need to compare values of different types, perform an explicit type conversion first, then use the strict operators.
