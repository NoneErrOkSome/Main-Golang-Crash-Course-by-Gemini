You can use **template literals** in JavaScript to construct strings more easily, especially when embedding variables or creating multiline strings. Template literals are enclosed in **backticks (`` ` ``)** and allow you to insert expressions directly into the string using the **`${expression}`** syntax.

This method is generally cleaner and more readable than traditional string concatenation using the `+` operator, particularly for complex strings or when needing to manage spaces carefully.

## Building Strings

Here's how you can build strings using both traditional concatenation and template literals.

First, let's define some variables:



```JavaScript
const firstName = 'Jonas';
const job = 'teacher';
const birthYear = 1991;
const year = 2037; // Current year for calculation
```

### Traditional String Concatenation

Using the `+` operator to join strings and variables:



```JavaScript
// Traditional way to concatenate strings
const jonasOld =
  "I'm " +
  firstName +
  ', a ' +
  (year - birthYear) +
  ' years old ' +
  job +
  '!';
console.log(jonasOld);
// Output: I'm Jonas, a 46 years old teacher!
```

Notice the need to manually add spaces and use parentheses for calculations. If you need to use a single quote within a string defined by single quotes, you'd have to escape it (`\'`) or define the main string with double quotes.

### Using Template Literals

With template literals, the string construction is more straightforward:



```JavaScript
// Using template literals
const jonasNew = `I'm ${firstName}, a ${year - birthYear} years old ${job}!`;
console.log(jonasNew);
// Output: I'm Jonas, a 46 years old teacher!
```

Inside the backticks, any JavaScript expression (like variable names or calculations) can be placed inside `${...}`. JavaScript evaluates the expression and converts the result to a string.

You can also use backticks for regular strings without embedded expressions:



```JavaScript
console.log(`This is just a regular string using backticks.`);
// Output: This is just a regular string using backticks.
```

## Multiline Strings

Template literals also provide a much cleaner way to create multiline strings.

### Traditional Multiline Strings

Before ES6 (the version of JavaScript that introduced template literals), creating multiline strings was more cumbersome, often involving the newline character `\n` and concatenation or line continuation characters:



```JavaScript
// Traditional multiline string
console.log('String with \n\
multiple \n\
lines.');
// Output:
// String with
// multiple
// lines.
```

### Multiline Strings with Template Literals

With template literals, you simply press enter to create a new line, and it's preserved in the string:



```JavaScript
// Multiline string with template literals
console.log(`String
multiple
lines
with template literals.`);
// Output:
// String
// multiple
// lines
// with template literals.
```

This is particularly useful when constructing HTML strings from JavaScript, as it allows for more natural formatting.
