Okay, here's a summary of the lecture on JavaScript values and variables, including code examples:

## Values and Variables in JavaScript üßë‚Äçüíª

This lecture introduces the foundational concepts of **values** and **variables** in JavaScript.

---

### Values

A **value** is the most basic piece of data or information in programming.

- Strings are sequences of characters, usually enclosed in quotes.
- Numbers can be integers or decimals.
- Multiple values can be combined using operators (like arithmetic operators) to produce a new single value.

You can display values in the browser's console using `console.log()`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Examples of values
console.log("Jonas"); // A string value
console.log(23);      // A number value
console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10); // An expression that results in a single value (61)
```

### Variables

**Variables** are like containers (or labeled boxes) used to store values in your computer's memory. This allows you to reuse values throughout your code.

- You **declare** a variable using the `let` keyword, followed by the variable name, and then assign a value to it using the equals sign (`=`).
- Once a variable is declared and assigned a value, you can refer to it by its name. JavaScript will replace the variable name with the value it holds.
- A major benefit is that if you need to change the value, you only need to do it in one place (where the variable is assigned), and it will update everywhere the variable is used.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Declaring a variable and assigning a value
let firstName = "Jonas";

// Using the variable
console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);

// Changing the value of the variable
firstName = "Matilda";
console.log(firstName); // Now prints "Matilda"

// Example of descriptive variable names
let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let myCurrentJob = "Teacher";

console.log(myFirstJob); // Prints "Programmer"
```

### Naming Conventions and Rules for Variables

There are conventions and strict rules for naming variables:

#### Conventions (Best Practices):

1. **camelCase**: This is the standard in JavaScript. The first word is lowercase, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    let firstNamePerson; // camelCase example
    ```
    
2. **Descriptive Names**: Variable names should clearly indicate the value they hold.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Good:
    let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
    let myCurrentJob = "Teacher";
    
    // Less descriptive (avoid):
    let job1 = "Programmer";
    let job2 = "Teacher";
    ```
    
3. **Constants in Uppercase**: For values that will never change (constants), use all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    const PI = 3.14159;
    ```
    
4. **Avoid Starting with Uppercase (for regular variables)**: Variable names starting with an uppercase letter are typically reserved for specific uses in JavaScript, like object-oriented programming.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Conventionally for regular variables:
    let personName = "John";
    
    // Avoid for regular variables (used for constructor functions/classes):
    // let PersonName = "John";
    ```
    
5. **Avoid the name `name`**: While technically often allowed, the variable name `name` can sometimes conflict with predefined browser properties and is best avoided for clarity. Use more specific names like `firstName` or `lastName`.

#### Hard Rules (Must Follow):

1. **Cannot Start with a Number**:
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Illegal:
    // let 3years = 3;
    ```
    
2. **Allowed Characters**: Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), or dollar signs (`$`). Other symbols are not allowed.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Legal:
    let _function = 27;
    let $function = 27;
    let jonas_matilda = "JM";
    
    // Illegal (due to '&'):
    // let jonas&matilda = "JM";
    ```
    
3. **Cannot Use Reserved Keywords**: JavaScript has reserved keywords (like `new`, `function`, `let`, `const`, etc.) that cannot be used as variable names.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Illegal:
    // let new = 27;
    // let function = "test";
    ```
    
    However, you can often use a reserved keyword if you prefix it with `_` or `$`, as shown above (e.g., `_function`).

### Error Messages

- If you make a mistake in your code's syntax (a **syntax error**), the browser's developer console will display an error message.
- These messages usually indicate the type of error and the line number where it occurred, helping you debug your code. You don't need `console.log()` for errors to appear.

Understanding and using values and variables correctly, along with proper naming conventions, is crucial for writing clean, readable, and maintainable JavaScript code.
