Based on the transcript provided, we can break down the content into **four main topics**.

I can provide a dedicated, in-depth explanation for each of these:

1. **How Memory is Released in the Call Stack** (for primitive values).
2. **The Concept of Garbage Collection in the Heap** (for objects).
3. **How the Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm Works** (the process of finding and removing unused objects).
4. **The Problem of Memory Leaks** (what they are, common causes, and how to avoid them).
