## An In-Depth Overview: How JavaScript Code is Executed

This document explores the fundamental process of how JavaScript code is executed by the JavaScript engine, focusing on the concepts of execution contexts and the call stack.

### 1. The Execution Context

When JavaScript code is compiled and ready to be executed, it doesn't just run in a void. It runs within a specific environment called an **Execution Context**.

- What is an Execution Context?
    
    The transcript defines it as "an environment in which a piece of JavaScript is executed. It's like a box that stores all the necessary information for some code to be executed." Think of a pizza box: the pizza is the code, and the box is the execution context. The box contains other necessary items like cutlery and a receipt, which are analogous to the variables and other information the code needs to run.
    
- The Global Execution Context (GEC):
    
    When the script first starts, a Global Execution Context is created. This context is for "top-level code," which is "basically code that is not inside any function." All code outside of functions will be executed within this GEC. There is only ever one GEC in any project.
    
- Function Execution Contexts:
    
    Functions are only executed when they are called. "For each and every function call, a new execution context will be created containing all the information that is necessary to run exactly that function." This applies to methods as well, since they are functions attached to objects.
    

### 2. What's Inside an Execution Context?

Each execution context contains several key components, which are generated in a "creation phase" that happens right before the code is executed.

1. **Variable Environment:**
    
    - All variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` within a function are stored here.
    - All function declarations are also stored here.
    - It also contains a special `arguments` object. This object holds all the arguments that were passed into the function when it was called.
2. **Scope Chain:**
    
    - A function can access variables defined outside of its own scope. This works because of the scope chain.
    - The scope chain **"consists of references to variables that are located outside of the current function."** Each execution context stores its scope chain to keep track of which variables it has access to.
3. **The `this` Keyword:**
    
    - Each execution context gets a special variable called the `this` keyword. Its value is determined by how the function is called.

Important Note on Arrow Functions:

The transcript highlights a crucial detail: "execution contexts belonging to arrow functions, do not get their own arguments keyword, nor do they get the this keyword... Instead, they can use the arguments object, and the this keyword from their closest regular function parent." This is a key difference between arrow functions and traditional functions.

### 3. The Call Stack

With potentially hundreds of functions being called, the engine needs a way to manage the order of execution. This is where the **Call Stack** comes in.

- What is the Call Stack?
    
    The transcript describes it as "a place where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, in order to keep track of where we are in the programs execution."
    
- **How it Works (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out):**
    
    1. When a function is called, its new execution context is "pushed" onto the top of the call stack.
    2. The execution context that is currently on top of the stack is the one that is actively running.
    3. When the currently running function finishes (i.e., when it `return`s), its execution context is "popped off" the stack.
    4. Execution then resumes in the context that is now on top of the stack.

The transcript notes: "Without the call stack, how would the engine know which function was being executed before? It wouldn't know where to go back to, right? And that's the beauty of the call stack." It acts like a map for the engine.

#### Step-by-Step Execution Example

Let's walk through this example code from the transcript to see the call stack in action:

JavaScript

```
const name = 'Jonas';

const first = () => {
  let a = 1;
  const b = second(7, 9);
  a = a + b;
  return a;
};

function second(x, y) {
  var c = 2;
  return c;
}

const x = first();
```

1. **Code is compiled.**
2. **Global Execution Context (GEC) is created** for all top-level code (`name`, `first`, `second`, and `x` declarations). This GEC is **pushed onto the call stack**. It's now the active context.
3. **Top-level code executes:** The `name` variable is declared. The `first` and `second` functions are declared and stored.
4. **`const x = first();` is reached.** The `first()` function is called.
5. **`first()` is called:**
    - An execution context for `first()` is created.
    - This new context is **pushed onto the call stack**, on top of the GEC. It is now the active context. Execution of the GEC is paused.
6. **Inside `first()`:**
    - `let a = 1;` is executed. `a` is stored in the variable environment of `first()`'s context.
    - `const b = second(7, 9);` is reached. The `second()` function is called.
7. **`second()` is called:**
    - An execution context for `second()` is created.
    - This context is **pushed onto the call stack**, on top of `first()`'s context. It is now the active context. Execution of `first()` is paused.
8. **Inside `second()`:**
    - `var c = 2;` is executed.
    - `return c;` is executed. The function finishes and will return the value `2`.
9. **`second()` returns:**
    - The execution context for `second()` is **popped off the stack**.
    - Execution returns to the `first()` function, which now becomes the active context again.
10. **Back inside `first()`:**
    - The value returned from `second()` (which is `2`) is assigned to the variable `b`. So, `b` is `2`.
    - `a = a + b;` is executed (`a = 1 + 2`), so `a` becomes `3`.
    - `return a;` is executed. The function `first()` finishes and will return the value `3`.
11. **`first()` returns:**
    - The execution context for `first()` is **popped off the stack**.
    - Execution returns to the GEC, which becomes the active context again.
12. **Back in top-level code:**
    - The value returned from `first()` (which is `3`) is assigned to the variable `x`.
13. **Script finishes:** The script has finished its main work. The engine will now wait for callback functions (from events) to arrive. The GEC remains until the program is truly terminated (e.g., the browser tab is closed).

### Brief Summary

JavaScript code runs inside an **Execution Context**, which acts as an environment holding all necessary information like local variables, scope details, and the `this` keyword. A **Global Execution Context** is created for top-level code, and a new **Function Execution Context** is created for every function call.

The **Call Stack** is a data structure that manages these execution contexts in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order. When a function is called, its context is pushed onto the stack, becoming the active context. When the function returns, its context is popped off, and control returns to the previous context. This mechanism allows the JavaScript engine to keep track of the order of execution in a program. It's important to note that arrow functions have a special execution context that does not have its own `arguments` object or `this` keyword; they inherit these from their parent function.
