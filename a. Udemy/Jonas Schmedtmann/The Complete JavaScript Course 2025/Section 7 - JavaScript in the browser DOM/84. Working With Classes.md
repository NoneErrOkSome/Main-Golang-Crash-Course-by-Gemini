## In-Depth Guide: Making the Modal Window Interactive with JavaScript

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of how to bring the modal window project to life by handling click events and manipulating CSS classes using JavaScript. The explanations and code are based on the provided lesson transcript and refer to the "Modal window" project files.

### 1. Introduction: Reacting to User Actions

The goal is to make the modal window appear when any of the "Show modal" buttons are clicked and disappear when the close button, the overlay, or (eventually) the Escape key is pressed. This involves listening for user events and then manipulating the DOM, primarily by adding or removing CSS classes.

### 2. Attaching Event Listeners to "Show Modal" Buttons

We have multiple "Show modal" buttons, all sharing the class `show-modal`. We need to attach an event handler to each of them.

a. Selecting the Buttons:

As established in the previous setup, document.querySelectorAll('.show-modal') selects all these buttons and returns a NodeList.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// From modal - script.js (assuming these are already selected)
const modal = document.querySelector('.modal');
const overlay = document.querySelector('.overlay');
const btnCloseModal = document.querySelector('.close-modal');
const btnsOpenModal = document.querySelectorAll('.show-modal');
```

b. Looping and Attaching Event Listeners:

We iterate through the btnsOpenModal NodeList using a for loop. In each iteration, btnsOpenModal[i] refers to the current button element. On this element, we call addEventListener.

The `addEventListener` method takes two main arguments:

1. The type of event (e.g., `'click'`).
2. An event handler function: This function contains the code that executes when the event occurs.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
for (let i = 0; i < btnsOpenModal.length; i++) {
  btnsOpenModal[i].addEventListener('click', function () {
    // Code to show the modal will go here
    console.log('Button clicked!'); // Initial test
  });
}
```

The transcript explains, "now each of these three buttons here has their own event handler function attached to it... because we did it here in the loop". The function provided as the second argument is an "anonymous function... a function without a name, and it is of course also a function expression."

---

### 3. Manipulating CSS Classes for Visibility: `element.classList`

The modal and overlay are initially hidden because they have the `.hidden` class, which applies `display: none;` in the CSS. To show them, we need to remove this class. JavaScript provides the `classList` property for this.

a. Showing the Modal and Overlay (using classList.remove()):

Inside the event handler for the "Show modal" buttons, we select the modal and overlay elements (which we've already stored in variables) and use their classList.remove() method.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Updated event handler for 'Show modal' buttons in modal - script.js
 for (let i = 0; i < btnsOpenModal.length; i++) {
   btnsOpenModal[i].addEventListener('click', function () {
     console.log('Button clicked!');
     modal.classList.remove('hidden');
     overlay.classList.remove('hidden');
   });
 }
```

The transcript notes: "we take that selected element and on there we can read the class list property... And then this class list property itself has a couple of methods. And the one we're gonna use now is remove."

It also clarifies an important detail: "we do not use the dot here [in 'hidden']. So not like this [.hidden]. The dot is only for the selector. But here we are not anymore selecting anything. We're just passing in the name of the class."

b. Why Manipulate Classes Instead of Direct Styles?

While you could directly change the display style (e.g., modal.style.display = 'block';), manipulating classes is generally preferred.

"In practice adding and removing classes, like we just did here, is the main way in which we change styles on websites. That's because a class basically aggregates many styles in just one class... instead we can basically aggregate all of this properties in one class... and then in JavaScript we simply add and remove these classes as we need".

### 4. Implementing the "Close Modal" Functionality

a. Closing with the 'Ã—' Button:

We need to attach an event listener to the close button (class close-modal). When clicked, it should add the hidden class back to the modal and overlay.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
 btnCloseModal.addEventListener('click', function () {
   modal.classList.add('hidden');
   overlay.classList.add('hidden');
 });
```

Here, we use `classList.add('hidden')` to re-apply the `hidden` class.

b. Closing by Clicking the Overlay:

It's common for modals to close when the user clicks the background overlay.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
 overlay.addEventListener('click', function () {
   modal.classList.add('hidden');
   overlay.classList.add('hidden');
 });
```

Initially, this uses the same code as the close button's handler.

---

### 5. Refactoring for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Code

The code to close the modal (adding the `hidden` class to both modal and overlay) is now duplicated in two places. To avoid this, we can extract this logic into a separate, named function.

a. Creating Named Event Handler Functions:

"We can simply export this function into a more real named function."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
const openModal = function () {
  // console.log('Button clicked!'); // This can be removed after initial testing
  modal.classList.remove('hidden');
  overlay.classList.remove('hidden');
};

const closeModal = function () {
  modal.classList.add('hidden');
  overlay.classList.add('hidden');
};
```

b. Using Named Functions as Event Handlers:

Now, instead of an anonymous function, we pass the name of our defined function as the event handler. Crucially, do not add parentheses () when passing the function name here.

"Notice that we are not calling the function. We are not doing this [`closeModal()`]. This would not work at all, because it will immediately called a function, as soon as JavaScript executes this line. But that's not what we want to happen. We want to close modal function to be executed only as soon as the click event happens".

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Updated event listeners in modal - script.js
for (let i = 0; i < btnsOpenModal.length; i++) {
  btnsOpenModal[i].addEventListener('click', openModal); // Use the named function
}

btnCloseModal.addEventListener('click', closeModal); // Use the named function
overlay.addEventListener('click', closeModal);       // Use the same named function
```

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **DRYer Code:** The closing logic is defined in only one place.
- **Readability:** "Right now, when we read this code here, it's a lot easier to understand. So, we just read, button close modal, add the event listener of close the modal. Okay, that makes sense."

### Summary of Key Takeaways from this Lesson:

1. **Event Handling:** Use `element.addEventListener('eventType', handlerFunction)` to react to user interactions. The `handlerFunction` is executed by the JavaScript engine when the event occurs.
2. **Class Manipulation:** The `element.classList` property provides methods like `add('className')` and `remove('className')` to dynamically change an element's classes, which is the preferred way to alter styles controlled by CSS.
3. **Refactoring with Named Functions:** If the same event handling logic is needed for multiple elements or events, define that logic in a separate named function and pass that function's name as the event handler. This keeps code DRY and improves readability.

The next step in the transcript involves handling keyboard events (like the 'Escape' key) to also close the modal.
