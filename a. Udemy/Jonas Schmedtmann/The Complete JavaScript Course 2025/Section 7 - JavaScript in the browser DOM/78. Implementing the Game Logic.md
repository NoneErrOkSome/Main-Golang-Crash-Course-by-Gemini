Okay, I understand. You'd like the previous detailed document about implementing the "Guess My Number!" game logic, but with all comments removed from the JavaScript code blocks. The explanatory text outside the code will remain.

Here's the revised document:

## Implementing Game Logic for "Guess My Number!"

This document provides an in-depth walkthrough of implementing the core game logic for the "Guess My Number!" project. It covers defining a secret number, comparing user guesses, updating the score, and handling different game scenarios by manipulating the DOM. The explanations and code are based on the provided lesson transcript and refer to the "Guess My Number!" game files.

---

### 1. Defining the Secret Number

The first step in the game logic is to establish the secret number that the player needs to guess.

a. When and Where to Define:

The secret number should be defined once when the application starts, not every time the player makes a guess. Therefore, it's defined outside the event handler function for the "Check!" button. "If we define the secret number inside this handler function then on each click, we would get a new secret number. And so then the game would make no sense at all".

b. Generating a Random Secret Number:

The number should be random, typically between 1 and 20 for this game. This is achieved using Math.random() combined with Math.trunc().

- `Math.random()`: "gives us a number between zero and one."
- `Math.random() * 20`: This results in a number between 0 (inclusive) and 20 (exclusive), e.g., 0 to 19.999...
- `Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20)`: `Math.trunc()` removes the decimal part, resulting in an integer between 0 and 19.
- `Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20) + 1`: Adding 1 shifts the range to be between 1 and 20.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
'use strict';

let secretNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20) + 1;
```

The variable name `secretNumber` is used as it "makes a little bit more sense" than just `number`.

### 2. Handling the "Check!" Button Click: Core Game Scenarios

The main game logic resides within the event handler for the "Check!" button.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
document.querySelector('.check').addEventListener('click', function () {
  const guess = Number(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
  console.log(guess, typeof guess);

});
```

#### a. Scenario 1: No Input

First, check if the player actually entered a guess. If the input field is empty, `Number('')` evaluates to `0`, which is a falsy value.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
if (!guess) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '⛔️ No number!';
}
```

"Usually in an application like this... the first thing to do is to check if there actually is a value."

#### b. Scenario 2: Guess is Correct

If the player's guess matches the `secretNumber`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
else if (guess === secretNumber) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '🎉 Correct Number!';
}
```

"When the guess is the same as the secret number that's essentially what the guess being means".

#### c. Scenario 3: Guess is Too High

If the player's guess is greater than the `secretNumber`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
else if (guess > secretNumber) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📈 Too high!';
}
```

#### d. Scenario 4: Guess is Too Low

If the player's guess is less than the `secretNumber`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
else if (guess < secretNumber) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📉 Too low!';
}
```

With these `if-else if` blocks, "we are covering all the different scenarios that might happen here to this number."

---

### 3. Implementing Score Logic

The game includes a score that decreases with each incorrect guess.

a. Storing the Score:

It's best practice to store the score in a JavaScript variable rather than just relying on the DOM. "It's always good to keep a variable which actually holds the data in our code and not just rely on the DOM to hold our data... This variable here can also be called a state variable. Because this score is part of the so-called application state".

JavaScript

```JavaScript
let score = 20;
```

b. Decreasing Score on Wrong Guess:

When a guess is wrong (too high or too low), the score should decrease by 1, and the DOM should be updated.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
else if (guess > secretNumber) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📈 Too high!';
  score--;
  document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
}
```

JavaScript

```JavaScript
else if (guess < secretNumber) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📉 Too low!';
  score--;
  document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
}
```

c. Handling Game Over (Score Reaches 0):

The game should end if the score drops to 0. The logic for decreasing the score should only happen if the score is still above 1 (meaning it won't go below 0 after decrementing).

The transcript evolves this by adding a nested `if` statement: "all of this checking here... should only happen whenever the score is still above zero. And then when the score is actually zero, then we should get some kind of message here saying that we lost the game." The condition `score > 1` is used before decrementing to ensure that if the score is `1`, the next wrong guess results in losing the game directly, rather than the score going to `0` and then checking.

Combined and Refined Logic for Wrong Guesses:

This structure is shown in your provided script.js file for the "Guess My Number!" project.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
else if (guess !== secretNumber) {
  if (score > 1) {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent =
      guess > secretNumber ? '📈 Too high!' : '📉 Too low!';
    score--;
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  } else {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '💥 You lost the game!';
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
  }
}
```

The transcript shows developing this logic by first handling "too high" with the nested `if (score > 1)` and then applying similar logic to the "too low" scenario, noting the code duplication that would be fixed later. The provided final `script.js` for the game effectively refactors this into a single `else if (guess !== secretNumber)` block.

This detailed implementation of the game logic forms the core of the "Guess My Number!" application, handling user input, state changes (score), and updating the user interface to reflect the game's progress. Further enhancements would include the high score functionality and the "Again!" button.
