## In-Depth Guide: Selecting and Manipulating DOM Elements

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of selecting HTML elements using JavaScript and manipulating their content, focusing on the `.textContent` property for general elements and the `.value` property for input fields, as explained in the "Selecting and Manipulating Elements" lecture (Lecture 76). The examples will often refer to elements found in the "Guess My Number!" game project.

### Revisiting Element Selection with `document.querySelector()`

To interact with any part of a webpage using JavaScript, you first need to select the specific HTML element. The `document.querySelector()` method is a common way to do this. It takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element in the document that matches the selector.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Example: Selecting the element with the class 'message'
// This element is used to display messages like "Start guessing..." or "Correct Number!"
const messageElement = document.querySelector('.message');
```

---

### Working with `.textContent`

Once an element is selected, you can read or change the text it displays using its `textContent` property.

#### Reading `textContent`

You can retrieve the current text content of an element. This is useful for checking the current state of an element or using its text in your logic.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Assuming the HTML for '.message' initially contains "Start guessing..."
// as seen in the "Guess My Number!" index.html
console.log(document.querySelector('.message').textContent);
// Output: Start guessing...
```

The transcript notes: "in this line we started by reading the content of the element, and so at the beginning it will still start guessing. Because that's what's written here in the HTML element, in the beginning, right?"

#### Setting `textContent`

This is a core part of DOM manipulation â€“ dynamically changing what the user sees. You assign a new string to the `textContent` property.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Change the message displayed to the user
document.querySelector('.message').textContent = 'ðŸŽ‰ Correct Number!';
// The text on the page for the element with class 'message' will now show "ðŸŽ‰ Correct Number!"
```

The instructor explains: "we will actually set this content to something else. And we do that by writing equal, and then whatever we want the new content to be."

After setting the `textContent`, if you were to read it again, it would reflect this new value:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
console.log(document.querySelector('.message').textContent);
// Output: ðŸŽ‰ Correct Number!
```

#### Manipulating Other Display Elements

This technique applies to any non-input element where you want to change the displayed text. In the "Guess My Number!" game, this is used for the secret number display and the score.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// To display the secret number (element with class 'number')
// Initially, it shows '?'
document.querySelector('.number').textContent = 13; // Displays 13

// To update the score (element with class 'score')
// Initially, it shows '20'
document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 10;  // Displays 10
```

A crucial point from the transcript: "I'm actually, I'm forgetting the text content here, so we cannot set the entire element, because the element has way more than just the content. So I really have to say that the text content should be 13." You must specifically target the `textContent` property for assignment.

### Working with Input Fields and the `.value` Property

HTML `<input>` fields are designed for user data entry. To interact with the data _inside_ an input field, JavaScript uses the `.value` property.

#### Selecting an Input Field

As with other elements, use `document.querySelector()` with an appropriate selector. For the "Guess My Number!" game, the input field for the user's guess has the class `guess`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
const guessInputElement = document.querySelector('.guess');
```

#### Reading the `.value` of an Input Field

To get the text or number currently entered by the user (or set by JavaScript) in an input field, you read its `.value` property.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// If the input field is empty:
console.log(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
// Output: "" (an empty string)

// If the user has typed "15" into the input field:
// console.log(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
// Output would be: "15" (Note: input values are often retrieved as strings)
```

The transcript states: "with an input field, to get the actual value, we use the value property."

#### Setting the `.value` of an Input Field

You can also programmatically fill or change the content of an input field by assigning a string (or a value that can be converted to a string) to its `.value` property.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
document.querySelector('.guess').value = 23;
// The input field on the webpage will now display the number 23.
```

The instructor notes: "instead of us written the number, it was JavaScript who wrote the 23 here for us. Simply by executing this code here."

To see the effect of setting and then reading the value, the order of operations matters:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// First, set the value of the input field
document.querySelector('.guess').value = 23;

// Then, read and log the value
console.log(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
// Output: 23 (or "23" as a string)
```

The transcript explains: "Now we first write 23 here to this input field, and then afterwards we read it, and then the value is indeed 23".

This exploration covers the fundamental ways to select elements and then read or update their displayed text using `.textContent` for general elements, and `.value` for input fields. These techniques are foundational for building interactive web applications where JavaScript dynamically responds to and modifies the webpage content. The next step often involves handling user events, like button clicks, to trigger these DOM manipulations.
