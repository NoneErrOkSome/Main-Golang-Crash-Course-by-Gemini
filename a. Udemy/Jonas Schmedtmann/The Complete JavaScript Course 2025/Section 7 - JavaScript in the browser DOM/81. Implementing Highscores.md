## In-Depth Guide: Implementing High Score Functionality

This document details the process of adding a high score feature to the "Guess My Number!" game, based on the provided lesson transcript. This involves storing, checking, updating, and displaying the player's best score across multiple rounds of the game within the same session.

### 1. Understanding the High Score Logic

The core idea behind the high score is to keep track of the best score achieved by the player. As demonstrated in the game:

- The high score is initially set (e.g., to 0).
- When a player wins a game (guesses the correct number), their current `score` for that game is compared to the `highscore`.
- If the current `score` is greater than the `highscore`, the `highscore` is updated to this new, better score.
- This `highscore` should persist even when the player clicks the "Again!" button to start a new game (though a full page reload will reset it, as it resets all JavaScript variables).

---

### 2. Storing the High Score

To manage the high score, we need a variable in our JavaScript code. This variable will hold the highest score achieved so far.

Initialization:

"First off, we're gonna to need a variable for the high score... So let, high score and let's start this one at zero."

This variable should be declared in the global scope of the script, alongside secretNumber and score, so that its value persists between games (initiated by the "Again!" button).

JavaScript

```JavaScript
'use strict';

let secretNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20) + 1;
let score = 20;
let highscore = 0; // Initialize highscore to 0

// ... (displayMessage function and other initial setup) ...
```

Initializing `highscore` to `0` ensures that "the first score is always gonna be the highest score, because it's always going to be greater than zero."

### 3. Checking and Updating the High Score

The logic for checking and updating the high score should occur when the player wins the game.

a. Location in Code:

"Remember that here the high score was set as soon as the player won the game. And so where is that in our code? Well, it's here in this if block" – specifically, the block where guess === secretNumber.

b. The Check and Update Logic:

Inside the "player wins" condition, we compare the current score with the highscore.

"If our score of the current game is greater than the highest score that we already had, well, then the highest score will become this new current score."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Inside the .check button's event listener, within the 'guess === secretNumber' block:

  } else if (guess === secretNumber) {
    displayMessage('🎉 Correct Number!');
    document.querySelector('.number').textContent = secretNumber;

    document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#60b347';
    document.querySelector('.number').style.width = '30rem';

    // New highscore logic starts here
    if (score > highscore) {
      highscore = score; // Update highscore if current score is greater
      // Now display the new highscore
      document.querySelector('.highscore').textContent = highscore;
    }
    // New highscore logic ends here
  }

```

c. Displaying the High Score:

After updating the highscore variable, we also need to update the corresponding element on the webpage so the player can see it. The element for displaying the high score has the class .highscore.

The code to display it is:

document.querySelector('.highscore').textContent = highscore;

This line selects the HTML element with the class `highscore` and sets its text content to the current value of the `highscore` JavaScript variable.

### 4. Complete Game Logic with High Score Implementation

Here's how the relevant parts of the `script.js` file look with the high score functionality integrated, based on the transcript and your provided game files.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
'use strict';

let secretNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20) + 1;
let score = 20;
let highscore = 0;

const displayMessage = function (message) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = message;
};

// document.querySelector('.number').textContent = secretNumber; // For debugging

document.querySelector('.check').addEventListener('click', function () {
  const guess = Number(document.querySelector('.guess').value);

  if (!guess) {
    displayMessage('⛔️ No number!');
  } else if (guess === secretNumber) {
    displayMessage('🎉 Correct Number!');
    document.querySelector('.number').textContent = secretNumber;
    document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#60b347';
    document.querySelector('.number').style.width = '30rem';

    if (score > highscore) {
      highscore = score;
      document.querySelector('.highscore').textContent = highscore;
    }
  } else if (guess !== secretNumber) {
    if (score > 1) {
      displayMessage(guess > secretNumber ? '📈 Too high!' : '📉 Too low!');
      score--;
      document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
    } else {
      displayMessage('💥 You lost the game!');
      document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
    }
  }
});

document.querySelector('.again').addEventListener('click', function () {
  score = 20;
  secretNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20) + 1;

  displayMessage('Start guessing...');
  document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  document.querySelector('.number').textContent = '?';
  document.querySelector('.guess').value = '';

  document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#222';
  document.querySelector('.number').style.width = '15rem';
  // document.querySelector('.number').textContent = secretNumber; // For debugging after reset
});
```

### 5. Testing the High Score Functionality

The transcript emphasizes the importance of testing all scenarios:

1. **First Win:** Win the game. The current score (e.g., 14) should become the high score, as it's greater than the initial high score of 0.
    - "And you see the new high score is now 14. Because it used to be zero, but of course, 14 is greater. And so 14 becomes our new high score."
2. **"Again!" Button:** Click the "Again!" button. The current score resets to 20, but the high score (e.g., 14) should remain displayed.
    - "Everything will reset, except for the high score."
3. **New Higher Score:** Play again and win with a score that is higher than the current high score (e.g., win with a score of 18 when the high score is 14). The high score should update to 18.
4. **New Lower Score:** Play again and win with a score that is lower than the current high score (e.g., win with a score of 12 when the high score is 18). The high score should _not_ change and remain 18.
    - "So you see that the score was now 12. But the highest score, of course, remained at 18. Because this part here (`if (score > highscore)`) is now not true."

With the implementation of the high score, the "Guess My Number!" game is functionally complete. The next logical step, as mentioned in the transcript, is to "finish up and clean this code a little bit" through refactoring to eliminate duplicate code.
