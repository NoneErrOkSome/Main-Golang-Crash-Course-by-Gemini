## Handling DOM Events: Responding to User Actions

This document provides an in-depth guide to handling DOM events in JavaScript, focusing on using **event listeners** to react to user interactions, such as button clicks. The examples and explanations are based on the initial steps of building the "Guess My Number!" game.

### Understanding DOM Events and Event Listeners

An **event** is essentially "something that happens on the page." This could be a user action like a mouse click, a key press, the mouse moving over an element, or events triggered by the browser itself (like a page finishing loading).

To make our web pages interactive, we need a way to detect these events and then execute some code in response. This is where **event listeners** come in. "With an event listener, we can wait for a certain event to happen, and then react to it."

### Implementing an Event Listener: The `addEventListener()` Method

The process generally involves two main steps:

1. Selecting the HTML element you want to monitor for an event.
2. Attaching an event listener to that element, specifying the event type and the function to run when the event occurs.

The `addEventListener()` method is "the best one and also the most used one" for this purpose.

#### Step 1: Selecting the Target Element

First, you need a reference to the DOM element where the event will originate. In the "Guess My Number!" game, we want to react when the "Check!" button is clicked.

We use `document.querySelector()` to select this button. Looking at the `index.html` file, the "Check!" button has two classes: `btn` and `check`. The class `.btn` might be generic for multiple buttons, so `.check` is more specific for this particular button.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// script.js
'use strict';

// Select the element where the event should happen (the "Check!" button)
const checkButton = document.querySelector('.check');
```

#### Step 2: Attaching the Event Listener with `addEventListener()`

Once the element is selected, you call the `addEventListener()` method on it. This method typically takes two main arguments:

1. **The Event Type (a string):** This specifies which event to listen for. For a mouse click, the type is `'click'`.
2. **The Event Handler Function (Callback Function):** This is the function that will be executed when the specified event occurs on the element. This function is often called a "callback function" because it's passed to another function (`addEventListener`) to be called later by the JavaScript engine.

"That function will contain exactly the code that should be executed whenever this click event happens on this Check button. And that function is going to be called the event handler."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// script.js (continued)

// Attach an event listener to the 'checkButton'
// The first argument is the event type: 'click'
// The second argument is the event handler function
checkButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // This code will run every time the 'checkButton' is clicked
  const guess = document.querySelector('.guess').value;
  console.log(guess); // Log the value from the input field with class 'guess'
});
```

**Key points about the event handler function:**

- It's a function expression provided directly as an argument. The transcript notes: "we wrote here a function... We simply did not assign it to any variable. Instead, we passed it directly here into the `addEventListener` method."
- **Crucially, "we do not call this function here anywhere, right? We only define the function here, and then pass it into the event handler. But it is the JavaScript engine who will call this function as soon as the event happens."**

### Implementing Initial Game Logic Inside the Event Handler

Now, let's build upon the event handler to implement the first pieces of logic for the "Guess My Number!" game.

#### 1. Retrieving and Converting the User's Guess

When the "Check!" button is clicked, we need to get the number entered by the user in the input field (which has the class `guess`).

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// script.js (inside the event listener's handler function)

checkButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // Get the value from the input field
  const guessValueString = document.querySelector('.guess').value;
  // "instead of just logging it to the console, let's actually save it into a variable."

  // Input values are usually strings, so convert to a number for comparisons
  // "if we want to compare numbers with numbers, we need to first convert this string to a number."
  const guess = Number(guessValueString);

  console.log(guess, typeof guess);
  // If user types 5 and clicks Check!, output: 5 'number'
  // If user types nothing and clicks Check!, output: 0 'number' (empty string converts to 0)
});
```

The transcript highlights: "usually whenever we get something from the user interface, for example, from an input field, it usually always is a string." Hence the `Number()` conversion.

#### 2. Handling the "No Input" Scenario

A good practice is to first check if the user actually provided any input.

If the input field is empty, `document.querySelector('.guess').value` will be an empty string `""`. When `Number("")` is evaluated, it results in `0`. The number `0` is a **falsy value** in JavaScript.

We can use this to display a message if no number was entered:

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// script.js (extending the event listener's handler function)

checkButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
  const guess = Number(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
  console.log(guess, typeof guess); // For debugging

  // "if there is no value, well, then we can print something to the console as a response."
  // "If I click on the button now, indeed, we get zero, and zero is a false value."
  // "And so guess our here, in this logical context of the FL statement, will be false."
  // "But we want something to happen whenever this is false. And so here, we actually want a true value, right?
  // And so we simply use the negation operator to then invert this Boolean from false to true."
  if (!guess) { // If guess is 0 (falsy), !guess becomes true
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '⛔️ No number!';
  } else {
    // Later, we'll add logic for correct guess, too high, too low, etc.
    // For now, let's just acknowledge a guess was made
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = `You guessed: ${guess}`;
  }
});
```

When an empty input is processed, `guess` becomes `0`. In the `if (!guess)` condition:

1. `guess` (which is `0`) is coerced to `false` in a boolean context.
2. `!false` becomes `true`.
3. The `if` block executes, and the message "⛔️ No number!" is displayed.

This demonstrates how to make your application react to user events (button clicks), retrieve data from input fields, perform basic validation and type conversion, and update the DOM to provide feedback to the user. The next steps in the game development would involve generating a secret number and comparing the user's guess to it.
