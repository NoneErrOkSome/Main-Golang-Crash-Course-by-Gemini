## In-Depth Guide: Implementing the "Roll Dice" Functionality in the Pig Game

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of implementing the core "Roll Dice" functionality for the "Pig Game" project. It covers event handling, random number generation, dynamic DOM manipulation for images and text, and state management for the current score. The explanations are based on the provided lesson transcript and refer to the Pig Game project files.

### 1. Planning the Logic with a Flowchart

Before implementing a feature, it's helpful to break down the required steps. The transcript references the provided flowchart to guide the implementation.

For the **"User rolls dice"** action, the steps are:

1. Generate a random dice roll (a number from 1 to 6).
2. Display the corresponding dice image.
3. Check if the rolled number is a 1.
    - If **NO**, add the dice roll to the player's current score.
    - If **YES**, the player loses their current score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The transcript notes that "having or building a flow chart like this is pretty similar to actually dividing the big problem down into smaller sub problems."

### 2. Attaching the Click Event Handler

To react to the user clicking the "Roll dice" button, we must first select the button element and then attach an event listener to it.

a. Selecting the Button Elements:

First, we select the game's three main buttons and store them in variables for easy access.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In script-pig.js
// Selecting elements (assuming others like score and dice elements are also selected)
const btnNew = document.querySelector('.btn--new');
const btnRoll = document.querySelector('.btn--roll');
const btnHold = document.querySelector('.btn--hold');
```

b. Adding the Event Listener:

We attach a 'click' event listener to the "Roll dice" button (btnRoll). The handler function will contain all the logic that needs to execute when the button is clicked.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In script-pig.js
// Rolling dice functionality
btnRoll.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // 1. Generating a random dice roll
  // 2. Display dice
  // 3. Check for rolled 1
  // Logic for these steps will go here
});
```

The transcript states, "since we will not reuse this function, I can simply write it here directly."

### 3. Implementing the Game Logic Inside the Handler

#### a. Generating and Displaying the Dice

Generating a Random Dice Roll:

Inside the handler, the first step is to generate a random number between 1 and 6. "Each time that we roll the dice, we want to generate a new number. And so let's simply define that variable here."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Inside the 'click' event handler
// 1. Generating a random dice roll
const dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
```

This uses `Math.random()` to get a number between 0 and almost 1, multiplies by 6, uses `Math.trunc()` to remove the decimal part (resulting in 0-5), and adds 1 to get the final range of 1-6.

Displaying the Dice Image:

First, the dice element (which was hidden initially) needs to be made visible. Then, its src attribute is dynamically changed to match the rolled dice number. The project files include images named dice-1.png, dice-2.png, etc.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Inside the 'click' event handler
// Assume diceEl = document.querySelector('.dice'); was defined earlier
const diceEl = document.querySelector('.dice'); // For clarity in this snippet

// 2. Display dice
diceEl.classList.remove('hidden');
diceEl.src = `dice-${dice}.png`; // Dynamically sets the image source
```

The transcript explains the trick: "we can manipulate this source attribute from our JavaScript... And so with this, we can dynamically load one of these six images here, depending on the random rolled dice."

#### b. Checking for a Rolled 1 and Updating the Score

After rolling, we check if the game continues or if the turn is over.

Storing the Current Score:

To accumulate score within a turn, we need a variable. "We should not only display this current score on the user interface. Instead, we also want the variable in our code, which always holds the current score of this current round." This variable must be defined outside the event handler to persist between clicks.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// At the top of script-pig.js
let currentScore = 0; // Needs to be 'let' because it will be updated
```

"If we did that [defined it] in this handler function... then each time that we roll a dice, the current score would be reset it."

Implementing the Logic:

We use an if/else statement to handle the two main outcomes of a roll.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Inside the 'click' event handler
// 3. Check for rolled 1
if (dice !== 1) {
  // Add dice to current score
  currentScore += dice; // Same as currentScore = currentScore + dice
  document.getElementById('current--0').textContent = currentScore; // Change later to use active player
} else {
  // Switch to next player (functionality to be implemented in a later lecture)
}
```

- **If `dice` is not 1:** We add the `dice` value to `currentScore`. Then, we update the DOM to display this new current score. The transcript shows selecting the current score element for player 0 (`#current--0`) and updating its `.textContent`. It acknowledges that this will need to be changed later to dynamically target the active player.
- **If `dice` is 1:** The `else` block is triggered. The logic for switching players is deferred to the next lesson.

With these steps, the core functionality for rolling the dice is implemented. The game can now generate a random roll, display the correct image, and accumulate a current score for a single player. The next steps will involve managing player switching, holding scores, and determining a winner.
