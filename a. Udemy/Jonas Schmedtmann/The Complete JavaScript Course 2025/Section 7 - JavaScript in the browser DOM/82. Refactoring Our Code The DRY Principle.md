## In-Depth Guide: Refactoring JavaScript for Cleaner Code

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of **refactoring** techniques applied to the "Guess My Number!" game project. Refactoring aims to improve code structure and reduce duplication without altering its external behavior. The explanations and code are based on the provided lesson transcript and refer to the "Guess My Number!" game files.

### 1. Understanding Refactoring

**Refactoring** is a crucial process in software development. The transcript defines it as **"to restructure the code but without changing how it works. So basically we do refactoring to improve the code and to eliminate duplicate code."**

**Why is duplicate code bad?**

- It violates the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**.
- If functionality needs to change, "we have to change the same code in multiple places," which can be error-prone and time-consuming, especially in larger codebases.

It's often acceptable to start with some duplicate code to get functionality working, and then refactor it. "When we first write the code then it's no big problem to start out with duplicate code... but then as we move on into project we can use a technique called refactoring".

### 2. Refactoring Technique 1: Consolidating Conditional Logic

The first step in refactoring is to "identify duplicate or almost duplicate code." In the "Guess My Number!" game, the scenarios for when the guess is too high and too low have very similar logic:

Original (Simplified) Duplicate Structure:

(This is how the code might have looked before the refactoring shown in the transcript)

JavaScript

```JavaScript
'use strict';
let secretNumber = 5; // Example
let score = 10;
const guess = 7; // Example

if (guess > secretNumber) { // When guess is too high
  if (score > 1) {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📈 Too high!';
    score--;
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  } else {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '💥 You lost the game!';
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
  }
} else if (guess < secretNumber) { // When guess is too low
  if (score > 1) {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📉 Too low!';
    score--;
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  } else {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '💥 You lost the game!';
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
  }
}
```



The primary difference is the message string (`'📈 Too high!'` vs. `'📉 Too low!'`).

The Refactoring Approach:

The transcript proposes unifying these two conditions because "in both cases what we're really doing is to check if the guess is different from the secret number". A single else if block can handle when the guess is wrong (guess !== secretNumber). Inside this block, a ternary operator can determine the specific message.

**Refactored Code (as per transcript and found in `script.js`):**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Inside the .check button's event listener, after checking for no input and correct guess:
// let score = 20; // Assume score is initialized elsewhere
// let secretNumber = 10; // Example
// const guess = 15; // Example

/*
else if (guess === secretNumber) {
  // ... player wins logic ...
}
*/
else if (guess !== secretNumber) { // When guess is wrong (either too high or too low)
  if (score > 1) {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent =
      guess > secretNumber ? '📈 Too high!' : '📉 Too low!';
    score--;
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  } else {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '💥 You lost the game!';
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
  }
}
```

Explanation of Refactoring:

"First we unified the two conditions that we had earlier... Both of these basically mean that the guess is different than a secret number and so we just created a block for that because all of this code here is the same in both situations. The only thing that changes is the message that is displayed on a page and so here, we then basically determined that message with the ternary operator." The ternary operator guess > secretNumber ? '📈 Too high!' : '📉 Too low!' returns the appropriate string, which is then assigned to textContent.

### 3. Refactoring Technique 2: Creating Reusable Functions

Another common refactoring technique involves identifying repetitive lines of code and extracting them into a reusable function. The transcript points out the repeated use of `document.querySelector('.message').textContent = ...`.

Identifying Duplication:

Lines like:

document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '⛔️ No number!';

document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '🎉 Correct Number!';

document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '📈 Too high!';

...are duplicated multiple times.

The Solution: Create a Helper Function

A function can be created to handle this specific DOM manipulation.

**Defining the `displayMessage` function (as in `script.js`):**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Defined typically at the top of the script or in a suitable scope
const displayMessage = function (message) {
  document.querySelector('.message').textContent = message;
};
```

"The function will be called `displayMessage`... and the parameter will be the `message` and then in the function block, all we will do is this repeated code... and then we will set it equal to the message that is passed into the function."

Using the displayMessage function:

Now, all previous instances of setting the message can be replaced with a call to this function.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// Inside the .check button's event listener:

// Example for "no input" scenario:
if (!guess) {
  // document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '⛔️ No number!'; // Old way
  displayMessage('⛔️ No number!'); // New way
}
// Example for "player wins" scenario:
else if (guess === secretNumber) {
  // document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '🎉 Correct Number!'; // Old way
  displayMessage('🎉 Correct Number!'); // New way
  // ... other win logic ...
}
// Example within the refactored "wrong guess" scenario:
else if (guess !== secretNumber) {
  if (score > 1) {
    // document.querySelector('.message').textContent = guess > secretNumber ? '📈 Too high!' : '📉 Too low!'; // Old way
    displayMessage(guess > secretNumber ? '📈 Too high!' : '📉 Too low!'); // New way
    score--;
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  } else {
    // document.querySelector('.message').textContent = '💥 You lost the game!'; // Old way
    displayMessage('💥 You lost the game!'); // New way
    document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
  }
}
```

**Benefits of this function extraction:**

- **DRY Code:** Eliminates repetition.
- **Readability:** "If we simply have a function called `displayMessage` it's a lot easier to simply read the code and say okay, this year probably means to display a message and this here is gonna be the message, right? That's a lot easier to understand when you read the code later".

The transcript also mentions that similar refactoring could be done for setting the number display, score display, or even generating the secret number, but it's not done for brevity in the lecture. "You could do the same for all the repetitive stuff here... I just wanted to make a point here that this is a really important thing that we do when we write real code."

Refactoring is an ongoing process in development. By identifying and eliminating duplicate code and by creating reusable functions, you make your codebase cleaner, easier to understand, and more maintainable in the long run. "Always keep refactoring in mind when you write your own code".
