## In-Depth Guide: Setting Up the "Pig Game" Project

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of the initial setup and implementation of the starting conditions for the "Pig Game" project. It covers the game's rules, planning with a flowchart, and the initial JavaScript code for element selection and DOM manipulation, as detailed in the lesson transcript and project files.

### 1. Project Overview: The Pig Game

The Pig Game is a two-player dice game designed to be a practice project to "reinforce all the skills that you have learned up until this point".

**Game Rules:**

- **Players:** The game has two players who take turns.
- **Rolling the Dice:** On their turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish. Each roll's value is added to their "Current" score.
- **Rolling a 1:** If a player rolls a 1, they lose their entire "Current" score, and it immediately becomes the next player's turn.
- **Holding Score:** A player can choose to "Hold" their "Current" score at any time. When they hold, the "Current" score is added to their main "Total" score. It then becomes the next player's turn.
- **Winning:** The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.
- **Resetting:** The "New game" button resets all scores and game state, returning to the starting conditions with Player 1 as the active player.

### 2. Planning the Game with a Flowchart

Before writing code for a project like this, it's helpful to visualize the application's logic. The transcript introduces a **flowchart** for this purpose. "This is a very nice way again, to visualize what happens in the application. And it's also a very good guide for us to actually implement the application in code."

The provided flowchart outlines three main user actions:

1. **User Rolls Dice:**
    - Generate a random dice roll.
    - Display the corresponding dice image.
    - Check if the roll is a 1.
        - **If NO:** Add the roll value to the current score and display the new current score.
        - **If YES:** The current score is lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. **User Holds Score:**
    - Add the current score to the active player's total score.
    - Check if the player's total score is now 100 or more.
        - **If YES:** The current player wins the game.
        - **If NO:** Switch to the next player.
3. **User Resets Game (New Game):**
    - Set all scores (current and total for both players) to 0.
    - Set Player 1 as the starting active player.

### 4. Implementing the Starting Conditions

The goal is to set both players' scores to 0 and hide the dice image when the page first loads.

a. Selecting DOM Elements for Manipulation

As a best practice, we first select all the necessary DOM elements and store them in variables at the top of our script. "We just defined them once at the top of our file instead of having to select the same elements over and over again."

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In script-pig.js
'use strict';

// Selecting elements
const score0El = document.querySelector('#score--0');
const score1El = document.getElementById('score--1'); // Another way to select by ID

const diceEl = document.querySelector('.dice');
// ... other element selections for buttons etc.
```

Note on Selecting by ID:

The transcript introduces two ways to select an element by its ID:

1. **`document.querySelector('#idName')`:** Uses a CSS selector syntax, requiring the `#` symbol.
2. **`document.getElementById('idName')`:** A more specific method that only works for IDs and does _not_ require the `#`. The transcript mentions this method "is supposed to be a little bit faster than query selector," but the difference is often negligible.

A naming convention like `score0El` (for element) is used to make it "really clear that this is a dom element" and not just the score value itself.

b. Setting the Initial Visual State

With the elements selected, we can now manipulate them.

Setting Scores to Zero:

We use the .textContent property to change the displayed scores to 0.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In script-pig.js
// Starting conditions
score0El.textContent = 0;
score1El.textContent = 0;
```

The transcript notes that even though we are assigning a number (`0`), "JavaScript will then automatically convert them to strings to actually display them on the page."

Hiding the Dice:

The strategy to hide the dice is the same one used in the modal window project: add a CSS class that sets display: none;.

First, ensure this class exists in style.css:

CSS

```JavaScript
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

Then, in the JavaScript, we add this class to the dice element on page load.

JavaScript

```
// In script-pig.js, with other starting conditions
diceEl.classList.add('hidden');
```

After implementing these lines of code, when the page is loaded, the scores for both players will correctly show `0`, and the dice image will be hidden, establishing the correct starting state for the game. The next step will be to implement the "Roll dice" functionality.
