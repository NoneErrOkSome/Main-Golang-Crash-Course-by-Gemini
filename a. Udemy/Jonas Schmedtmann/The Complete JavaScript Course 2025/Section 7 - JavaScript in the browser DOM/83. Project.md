## In-Depth Guide: Project Setup and Element Selection for a Modal Window

This document details the initial setup and DOM element selection process for building an interactive modal window component in JavaScript. It follows the explanations from the provided transcript and references the "Modal window" project files.

### 1. Introduction to the Modal Window Project

This project focuses on building a common UI component: a modal window.

The modal window is a pop-up dialog that appears on top of the main page content, often accompanied by an overlay that dims the background.

**Functionality to Implement:**

- Clicking one of several "Show modal" buttons will display the modal and the overlay.
- The modal can be closed by:
    - Clicking a specific "close" button within the modal.
    - Clicking on the semi-transparent overlay area outside the modal.
    - Pressing the 'Escape' (Esc) key on the keyboard.

A key learning objective for this project, as highlighted in the transcript, is "to learn how to work with classes. And that's super important, because manipulating classes is actually the main way in which we manipulate webpages."

### 2. Initial Project Setup and File Overview

Before writing JavaScript, it's essential to understand the existing HTML structure and CSS styling.

a. HTML Structure (modal - index.html):

The HTML file contains:

- Three buttons, each with the class `show-modal`, used to trigger the modal.
- A `div` element with the class `modal`. This is the modal window itself and contains a close button (class `close-modal`) and content.
- A `div` element with the class `overlay`. This will be the background dimming layer.
- Both the `.modal` and `.overlay` elements initially have the class `hidden`.

b. CSS Styling (modal - style.css):

The CSS file styles all the elements. Crucially, it defines the .hidden class:

CSS

```CSS
/* From modal - style.css */
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

This CSS rule is responsible for initially hiding the modal and overlay. The core mechanism for showing and hiding the modal will involve adding and removing this `hidden` class using JavaScript. "In this project, we will work with Classes. And so, this hidden class is the main class that we will be concerned with."

c. JavaScript Setup (modal - script.js):

The script starts with 'use strict'; to enable strict mode.

### 3. Selecting Necessary DOM Elements

A good practice when starting a project like this is to select all the DOM elements that will be interacted with and store them in variables at the top of the script. "We select the elements that we need, and then we store the selections into variables... nicely organized here at the top of the file, each in its own variable. So that's way better than selecting the same elements over and over again".

a. Selecting Single Elements with document.querySelector():

For elements that appear uniquely (or where we only need the first instance), document.querySelector() is used.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
'use strict';

const modal = document.querySelector('.modal');
const overlay = document.querySelector('.overlay');
const btnCloseModal = document.querySelector('.close-modal');
```

- `modal`: Selects the `div` with the class `modal`.
- `overlay`: Selects the `div` with the class `overlay`.
- `btnCloseModal`: Selects the button with the class `close-modal`.

b. Selecting Multiple Elements with document.querySelectorAll():

The "Show modal" functionality is triggered by three separate buttons, all sharing the class show-modal. If we used document.querySelector('.show-modal'), "only the first one will get selected."

To select all elements matching a selector, we use `document.querySelectorAll()`.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
const btnsOpenModal = document.querySelectorAll('.show-modal');
console.log(btnsOpenModal);
```

Understanding NodeList:

document.querySelectorAll() returns a NodeList, not an HTMLCollection or a standard JavaScript array. The transcript notes, "Now, you see that we get something called a Nodelist here... this NodeList here is a little bit like an array... here for now, it works as though it was an array." This means we can iterate over it, for example, using a for loop or array-like methods in modern browsers.

---

### 4. Working with the `NodeList` (Example: Looping)

Since `querySelectorAll` gives us a list of elements (the three "Show modal" buttons), we often need to iterate through this list to attach event listeners or perform other actions on each button. A `for` loop can be used for this.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// In modal - script.js
console.log("--- Looping through 'Show Modal' buttons ---");
for (let i = 0; i < btnsOpenModal.length; i++) {
  // btnsOpenModal[i] gives us the individual button element at each iteration
  console.log(btnsOpenModal[i].textContent);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Show modal 1
Show modal 2
Show modal 3
```

The transcript mentions a detail about loop syntax: "just like an if else statement, if there is only one line of code that I want to execute, I actually don't have to create this block [curly braces] okay, I can just write one line after the for loop." While true, using curly braces is generally recommended for clarity and to prevent errors if more lines are added later.

With these elements selected and stored in variables, the foundation is set to implement the interactive functionality of the modal window, which will involve adding and removing the `.hidden` class in response to user events.
