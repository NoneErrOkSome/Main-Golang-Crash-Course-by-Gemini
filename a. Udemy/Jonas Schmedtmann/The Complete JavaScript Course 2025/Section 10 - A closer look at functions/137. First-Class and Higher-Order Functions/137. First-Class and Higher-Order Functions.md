### **Study Guide: First-Class and Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript**

This guide explores the fundamental concept of first-class functions in JavaScript and how this feature enables the use of a powerful programming pattern known as higher-order functions.

### **1. First-Class Functions: Functions Are Just Values**

In JavaScript, functions are not a special, locked-away entity; they are treated just like any other value, such as a number, a string, or an object. This principle is what we call **first-class functions** (or "first-class citizens").

The core reason for this is that, behind the scenes, **functions in JavaScript are a special type of object**. Since objects are values, functions are values too.

This "function as a value" concept unlocks several powerful capabilities:

- **Store functions in variables or properties:** You can assign a function to a variable or place it inside an object as a method.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Storing a function in a variable (Function Expression)
    const greet = function() {
      console.log('Hello!');
    };
    
    // Storing a function in an object property (Method)
    const user = {
      name: 'Jonas',
      sayHi: function() { console.log('Hi there!'); }
    };
    ```
    
- **Pass functions as arguments to other functions:** You can pass a function into another function, just like you would pass a number or a string.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    const handleClose = () => console.log('Modal closed!');
    // Here, 'handleClose' is a function passed as an argument
    closeButton.addEventListener('click', handleClose);
    ```
    
- **Return a function from another function:** A function can be the return value of another function. This allows for creating advanced patterns and flexible code.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    function createGreeter() {
      // This function returns another function
      return () => console.log('Hello from the returned function!');
    }
    const myGreeter = createGreeter();
    myGreeter(); // Executes the returned function
    ```
    
- **Call methods on functions:** Since functions are objects, they can have their own methods. A common example is the `.bind()` method.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```JavaScript
    // We will explore .bind() in detail later in the course.
    ```

### **2. Higher-Order Functions: The Practical Application**

The fact that JavaScript has first-class functions makes it possible to write and use **higher-order functions**.

A **higher-order function** is defined by one of two characteristics:

1. It is a function that **receives another function as an argument**.
2. It is a function that **returns a new function**.

Let's look at both types.

#### **Type 1: Functions that Receive Other Functions**

This is the most common type of higher-order function you will encounter. The function that is passed in as an argument is called a **callback function**.

- **The Higher-Order Function:** The function that takes another function as input (e.g., `addEventListener`).
- **The Callback Function:** The function that is passed in (e.g., `greet`). It is "called back" later by the higher-order function at the appropriate time.

Example:

In the code button.addEventListener('click', greet),

- `addEventListener` is the **higher-order function** because it accepts the `greet` function as an argument.
- `greet` is the **callback function**. It's not executed immediately. Instead, `addEventListener` holds onto it and "calls it back" only when the `'click'` event occurs.

#### **Type 2: Functions that Return Other Functions**

This pattern is also common in JavaScript, especially in functional programming. The higher-order function acts like a "factory" that produces other functions.

**Example:**

JavaScript

```JavaScript
// 'createMultiplier' is a higher-order function because it returns a function.
function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
  // It returns a new function that "remembers" the multiplier.
  return function(number) {
    return number * multiplier;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2); // 'double' is now a function: number => number * 2
const triple = createMultiplier(3); // 'triple' is now a function: number => number * 3

console.log(double(10)); // 20
console.log(triple(10)); // 30
```

### **3. The Distinction: First-Class vs. Higher-Order**

It's important to understand the difference between these two related terms.

- **First-Class Function:** This is a **feature of a language**. It's a rule stating that functions are values. It is a fundamental concept, not something you write or implement in practice.
- **Higher-Order Function:** This is a **practical implementation** or a programming pattern that is **made possible by** the existence of first-class functions. You write higher-order functions in your code.

In short: **Because JavaScript has first-class functions, we are able to write and use higher-order functions.**
