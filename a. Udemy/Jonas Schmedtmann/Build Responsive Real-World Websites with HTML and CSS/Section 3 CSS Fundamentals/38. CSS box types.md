✅ Based **only on the transcript**, here are the **key rules and concepts** you need to remember about **CSS box types** (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`) — and other related rules that were explicitly mentioned.

---

## 🧱 1. `block`

**Rules to remember:**

- Takes up **100% width** of the parent (unless constrained)
    
- Always **starts on a new line**
    
- Can stack vertically
    
- **Box model (width, height, margin, padding)** works fully
    
- Examples: `h1`, `p`, `div`, `article`, `section`
    

---

## 🪶 2. `inline`

**Rules to remember:**

- Only takes up **the space it needs**
    
- Can sit **side-by-side** (in the same line)
    
- Does **not** start on a new line
    
- **Box model is limited:**
    
    - `width` and `height` → ❌ _no effect_
        
    - `margin` and `padding` → ✅ only horizontal (left/right), ❌ vertical (top/bottom)
        
- Examples: `strong`, `em`, `a`, `span`
    

---

## 🧱🪶 3. `inline-block` (mix of both)

**Rules to remember:**

- Takes only as much space as needed (**inline**-like)
    
- Can sit side-by-side like `inline`
    
- But allows full **box model** (`width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`) like `block`
    
- Does **not** force a new line
    
- Useful for precise layout control when using small elements side by side (e.g., nav links)
    
- Images (`<img>`) behave like `inline-block` by default

## ✅ Other Rules Explicitly Mentioned in the Transcript

### 🔸 Changing Box Types:

- Use `display: block` to **turn inline → block**
    
- Use `display: inline` to **turn block → inline**
    
- Use `display: inline-block` to **combine benefits**
    

---

### 🔸 Vertical Space Issues:

- `inline` elements:
    
    - ❌ vertical `margin` and `padding` won’t show
        
    - Only horizontal spacing applies
        
- `inline-block` or `block` solves this
    

---

### 🔸 Fixed Height Warning:

- Avoid using `height: 80px` on containers like headers  
    → content might **overflow or get cut off**
    

✅ Better to let the content define the height naturally

---

### 🔸 Default Box Behaviors:

- Most HTML elements are `block` by default
    
- Some (like `a`, `strong`, `em`, `img`) are `inline` or `inline-block`
    
- Usually, it's **best to leave them as-is** unless your layout needs change
    

---

### 🔸 Box Overlay in DevTools:

- Use **browser dev tools** to inspect:
    
    - padding (green)
        
    - margin (orange)
        
    - content area (blue)
        
- Helpful to visualize how boxes behave when styles change
    

---

### 🔸 Combining Pseudo-Classes:

```css
nav a:link:last-child {
  margin-right: 0;
}
```

✅ You can **chain multiple pseudo-classes**  
✅ Useful for edge-case spacing like “remove last margin”

## ✅ Summary Table

|Type|Line Break|Sizing Control|Box Model Works|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`block`|✅ Yes|✅ Full|✅ Full|Layout sections, headings|
|`inline`|❌ No|❌ No|❌ Top/bottom|Text-level elements|
|`inline-block`|❌ No|✅ Full|✅ Full|Side-by-side elements with box styling|
|`img`|❌ No|✅ Full|✅ Full|Behaves like `inline-block`|
