Instructor: In order to be able to effectively implement

the responsive web design ingredients

that we learned about in the last lecture,

we now need to quickly learn about how the rem unit

and how the max-width property work.

And let's actually start with the max-width property.

So here in our html, let's quickly create a div element

with the class of test,

and then let's select that.

And to start, I will simply define the width property

as 1,000 pixels, so just to see what happens.

Also, we should give it some background color

of red, let's say,

and also to see it a bit better,

a padding of 100 pixels,

okay?

So that's 1,000 pixel wide.

But now watch what happens when I decrease the screen.

So the element stays the same,

which we can see by this vertical scroll bars

that we have now.

So we can now basically scroll vertically here

because of course this element here still has 1,000 pixels.

And so therefore, the browser then needs to create

additional space here basically in the view port.

And so that's why we can scroll vertically like this, okay.

However, let's say that we don't want that to happen

and instead the behavior that we want to see

is that when there's no more additional space

to fit these thousand pixels here,

then the element should simply have the width

of the parent container.

And so that's exactly what we can use

the max-width property for.

So let's comment this one out and now say max-width.

So again, I'm using 1,000 pixels here,

and nevermind about using still pixels,

even though I said we shouldn't use them for a fluid layout

because here we are simply working with this property

and learning how it works.

Okay, let's start again with the big view port.

So now everything looks the same.

We can even inspect this here.

And so we see that it is still 1,000 pixels wide.

But now watch what happens

as we approach basically the end of the element.

So now we don't see anything happen.

But if we try to scroll vertically,

you see that it doesn't work.

And if we hover now,

we see that the element only has 912 pixels.

And if we go even more narrow, then it becomes even smaller.

So here we see that now it is only 455.

Oh, that's actually not the actual width.

So it is now 655 pixels, right?

So basically that's the width of the parent container,

which in this case is simply the body.

So the body has the same width now

as this element, all right?

And so this basically immediately makes this element here,

this test element flexible,

because now it very simply adapts

to the view port width, right?

Now you might have thought

that maybe we could have used percentages for this as well,

but actually that would not have the effect

that we were looking for.

So a percentage would not have worked

because up until 1,000 pixels, So like this,

we actually want the element

to be exactly 1,000 pixels wide.

So not any percentage of the view port.

Only once we reach a width here

that is less than the actual width of the element,

so only in that situation,

we actually want this width here

to adapt to the parent element.

So basically occupying 100%

of the width of the parent element, all right?

And so that is how max-width works.

And compressed into just one sentence,

we can say that if the container width is larger

than the specified max-width,

then the width of the element is equal

the value that was specified for max-width.

However, if the container width is less

than the specified max-width,

then the width of the element will be 100%

of the container element width, okay?

So take note of that summary,

and then hopefully you will never again forget

this important property here.

So take note of what I just said

and then hopefully you will never again forget

this very important property here now, okay?

But anyway, let's now move on to the rem unit.

Now, what does rem mean or what does it stand for?

Well, rem is the root element font size.

So that sounds quite strange indeed

but actually it is quite straightforward.

So the root of the document is the HTML element.

So basically the parent element of all the others, right?

Now, if we don't define any font size on this HTML element,

so which is again the root element,

then one rem is simply equal

to the default browser font size, which is always 16 pixels

unless the user does actually change it.

So let me actually demonstrate that to you here,

and again using the same example.

So I'm gonna use max-width again.

So let's say 500 rem, okay?

So what do you think the width here will be?

Well, remember that by default one rem

is equal to 16 pixel, right?

And again, that's because we did not specify any font size

on the HTML element.

And so therefore, the default font size of 16 is taken.

So one rem equals 16 pixels.

And so therefore, here this 500 rem will be,

well, let's do the calculation.

So 16 times 500.

So 8,000.

Oh, and actually I just wanted 50 rem.

So 50 rem would be 800 pixels, right?

So let's give it a save and then let's go check it out.

And so here we can immediately see right here

that it has a width of exactly 800 pixels, right?

And so that works.

Now, you might find it strange that we define length

in our design based on some font size, right?

But actually that is exactly

where the strength of the rem unit lies,

because then we can simply change the font size

on the HTML element

and that will then automatically change all the length

that are defined anywhere in our CSS

with the rem unit, right?

So let me give you some more example here.

So let's just give this here some white color

and give it a font size.

So let's say 10 rem or well, maybe just two rem actually.

So two rem would be 32 pixels, right?

So let's check out, and indeed that's right.

Also here we have another unit.

Let's move that down.

And this one we can also specify in rem.

Here let's say four rem.

And so four rem would be 64 pixels, right?

So let's confirm all that.

So indeed, we have 64 pixels here of padding,

then the width is again, as we see, 800 pixels,

and then as for the font size,

here it is specified of course in rem,

but I showed you before

that we can come here to the compute tab.

And if we then change for font size here,

it'll actually be the real one in pixels.

So as it is displayed on the screen.

So here it's already converted to pixels, right?

Because in the end, before elements can be displayed

on the page, all the relative units such as percentages

or rems needs to be converted back to pixels, okay?

And so here we see that it is indeed 32, okay?

But now let's say that on the HTML element right here,

we set the font size to just 10 pixels.

And so then one rem will no longer be 16 pixels

but it will instead be 10 pixels.

And so these 500 rem

that used to be 800 pixels, remember that?

So that's what we had before, but now not anymore

because now one rem will be 10 pixels.

And so 50 rem will be 500 pixels,

and the same will happen here.

So this will now be only 40 pixels

and a font size only 20 pixels.

And so if we take a look at this now,

then you see that basically the entire design,

which in this case is really small

but still the entire design here

shrink down basically by a factor of 62.5%.

And that's because 10 divided by 16 is 62.5%.

But that percentage doesn't really matter here.

What matters is that by changing the font size,

we can completely change the entire layout.

So if we try to double it,

then of course everything will get really big, right?

So now this element is 1,000 pixels

or at least it should be,

yes, it is,

and the text should be exactly 40 pixels

because two times 20 is 40, and the same for the padding.

So now it is 80 pixels, right?

And so maybe you can start to see

why this will be really, really handy

when we build responsive layouts.

Because for example, when we have a smaller screen,

then we want all the length to be a little bit smaller.

And then instead of having to change

all of these values here using media queries,

we can simply change the font size up here in the html

and that will then shrink everything down a little bit.

Okay, great.

Now, one useful trick as I mentioned in the last lecture

is to set the font size here to 10 pixels,

because then it is very easy to do the calculations.

So then we know immediately that this one here will be 500,

this is 40, and this is 20, right?

And so this is the way to go.

Setting the front size here to 10 pixels, okay?

Because again, then one rem will be exactly 10 pixels,

which is very easy to do calculations with.

However, this is still not perfect

because by doing it like this,

we will not respect the user's of the browser font size.

So let's say that the user changes the default

from 16 pixels to 20, then of course they would expect

that the font size on our page would increase, right?

But with this setup right here

that would actually not happen.

So no matter what the user would set the font size to now,

we would always have our default font size,

or root font size here at 10 pixels, right?

And so this would create huge usability problems for users

who for some reason have to increase

or even to decrease the font size of their browsers, okay?

And so in order to avoid that, we will not set the font size

to a fixed value like this,

but instead to a percentage of the default font size

of the browser.

So let's comment this one out,

and instead we will set the font size to 62.5 percentage.

And so let me explain you where that value comes from.

So we want our font size to be 10 pixels, right?

However, the default is 16 pixel.

And so we can simply divide 10 by those 16 pixels,

which will be 0.625, which is 62.5%.

And so that's exactly this value here, right?

So this percentage here is a percentage,

let me write it here also,

percentage of user's browser font size setting, all right?

And so again, if it is set to the default of 16,

then you see that 16 times 0.625,

this needs to be a comma in my case,

so that is then exactly 10, all right?

However, if for some reason

the user needs to change it to 18,

well then the font size increases to 11.28, right?

And so by using this technique,

we did actually respect the user's font size setting, okay?

And the same way,

if they set it like to 12 for some reason,

then our default font size on our page,

so one rem will then be 7.5, which in turn will make it

so that the entire layout is scaled down a little bit,

right?

So I hope that made sense.

And in fact, many, many, many web designers

and CSS developers use exactly this trick.

So it wasn't just me who came up

with his strange-looking technique,

but indeed it is something that is used widely

in the CSS developer community, okay?

And indeed, just to show you that it works,

here our font size is still at 20 pixels,

and the padding at 40, and the width at 500, all right?

And all of that dynamically,

because we are again respecting

the browser's font size setting

that the user chose for their particular case, okay?

And so now we know how the max-width property works

and how rem works.

And so from now on, we will no longer use pixels,

but we will always use rems,

and we will simply use that trick

where one rem is 10 pixels.

And so that is then very, very easy to do calculations with.

Nice, so hopefully all of that made sense to you

because it is important that you understand this

before moving on.

So make sure that you do understand it

and then let's go to the next lecture

where we will actually and finally start building

the Omnifood project.

So I can't wait to see you there.

so entire transcript, from start to the end come down to only one most single important for developer is that just to set html to font-size: 62.5%? How many part do you need to cover all the details? each part no more than 1000 characters


The transcript covers the concepts of max-width and rem units in CSS, emphasizing their importance in responsive web design. To summarize the key points into separate parts, we can break it down as follows:

**Part 1: Understanding Max-Width**  
explain here not more than 1000characters.

**Part 1: Understanding Max-Width**  
The `max-width` property in CSS is crucial for creating responsive web designs. It allows an element to adapt its size based on the container's width. When the container's width is larger than the specified `max-width`, the element maintains the defined `max-width`. However, if the container's width is smaller, the element adjusts to occupy 100% of the container's width. This behavior prevents horizontal scrolling and ensures that elements remain flexible across different screen sizes. By using `max-width`, developers can maintain a consistent design without resorting to fixed pixel values, making layouts more adaptive to varying viewport dimensions.


**Part 2: Introduction to REM Units**  
explain here not more than 1000characters.


**Part 2: Introduction to REM Units**  
REM (Root EM) units are a flexible and scalable way to define sizes in CSS, particularly useful for responsive design. A REM unit is based on the font size of the root HTML element. By default, 1 REM equals the browser's default font size, usually 16 pixels, unless altered by the user. This means that if you set an element's size using REM units, it will scale relative to the root font size. This gives developers control over scaling entire layouts by simply adjusting the root font size. For consistency and ease of calculation, many developers set the HTML element's font size to 62.5%, making 1 REM equal to 10 pixels. This approach respects user settings and allows for straightforward scaling across different devices, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness without directly relying on pixel values.

**Part 3: Setting Font Size with REM**  
explain here not more than 1000characters.


**Part 3: Setting Font Size with REM**  
Setting the font size using REM units provides a scalable approach to design that respects user preferences and enhances accessibility. By default, the browser's font size is 16 pixels, making 1 REM equal to this value unless changed by the user. To simplify calculations and maintain consistency, developers often set the HTML element's font size to 62.5%. This makes 1 REM equivalent to 10 pixels, allowing for easy conversion between REM and pixel values. This method ensures that all elements sized with REM units scale proportionally when the root font size is adjusted. It enables designs to adapt dynamically across different screen sizes and user settings without requiring complex media queries or manual adjustments for each element. This technique supports responsive web design by allowing global changes in layout dimensions through a single adjustment of the root font size.

**Part 4: Respecting User Preferences**  
explain here not more than 1000characters.


**Part 4: Respecting User Preferences**  
Incorporating user preferences in web design is vital for accessibility and user experience. By using REM units and setting the HTML font size to a percentage, developers ensure that designs respect the default browser settings that users may adjust for better readability or personal comfort. For instance, setting the HTML font size to 62.5% of the default (usually 16 pixels) allows 1 REM to equal 10 pixels, simplifying calculations while accommodating user changes. If a user increases their default font size for readability, elements sized with REM will scale accordingly, maintaining proportionality and usability. This approach prevents overriding individual user settings, which is crucial for users with visual impairments or other accessibility needs. Adopting this method ensures that web designs are flexible, adaptive, and inclusive, promoting a more universally accessible web experience without sacrificing design integrity or functionality.

what is the rem unit? no more than 1000 characters.


The `rem` unit in CSS stands for "root element font size." It is a relative unit that bases its measurement on the font size of the root element, typically the `<html>` element. By default, if no specific font size is set on the `<html>` element, one `rem` equals 16 pixels, which is the default browser font size.

The strength of using `rem` units lies in their ability to scale designs dynamically. When you define lengths using `rem`, adjusting the root font size will proportionally change all dimensions using `rem` throughout your CSS. This makes it easier to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and user preferences.

For instance, setting the root font size to a percentage like 62.5% can make calculations straightforward: 1 rem = 10 pixels (when default is 16 pixels). This approach respects user settings for browser font sizes, enhancing accessibility by allowing users to control text scaling without breaking layout proportions.

1rem is 10px or 14px?


The size of 1 `rem` is determined by the font size of the root element, typically the `<html>` element. By default, most browsers set this root font size to 16 pixels. However, you can adjust this size by explicitly setting a font size on the `<html>` element.

For example, if you set the root font size to 62.5% of the default (16 pixels), then:

- 62.5% of 16 pixels = 10 pixels
- Therefore, in this scenario, 1 `rem` would equal 10 pixels.

If no adjustments are made and the default browser settings are used, then:

- 1 `rem` would equal 16 pixels.

So, whether 1 `rem` is equal to 10px or any other value depends on how you've defined the root font size in your CSS.

does rem based on html?


Yes, the `rem` unit in CSS is based on the font size of the root element, which is typically the `<html>` element. The `rem` stands for "root em," and it allows you to define sizes relative to the root font size rather than the parent element's font size, which is what traditional `em` units do.

By default, if no specific font size is set on the `<html>` element, most browsers use a default root font size of 16 pixels. Therefore, 1 `rem` would equal 16 pixels unless this default is changed. You can modify this by setting a different font size on the `<html>` element in your CSS. For instance, setting it to 62.5% of the default makes calculations easier because it changes 1 `rem` to equal 10 pixels (62.5% of 16px = 10px). This flexibility makes `rem` units particularly useful for creating scalable and responsive designs.

where does 62.5% come from?


The 62.5% value is a common technique used by web developers to simplify calculations when using `rem` units in CSS. Here's the rationale behind it:

By default, most web browsers set the root font size (the font size of the `<html>` element) to 16 pixels. When you set the font size of the `<html>` element to 62.5% of its default size, you effectively change this font size to 10 pixels:

- \( 16 \text{px} \times 0.625 = 10 \text{px} \)

With this setup, 1 `rem` equals 10 pixels, making it easier to calculate sizes and dimensions in your CSS. For example, if you want an element to be 20 pixels wide, you can simply set its width to 2 `rem`. This approach simplifies mental math and makes it more intuitive for developers who prefer working with base-10 calculations.

However, it's important to note that while this technique can simplify development, it may not respect user preferences for browser font sizes if they've been adjusted for accessibility reasons.


do you mean user's font-size * 0.625 = x size for user? this is all about user side correct? no more than 1000 characters


Yes, the 62.5% technique adjusts the root font size relative to the user's default browser setting. If the user's default font size is 16 pixels (common in most browsers), setting the `<html>` font size to 62.5% changes it to 10 pixels:

- \( \text{User's Font Size} \times 0.625 = 10 \text{px} \) (if default is 16px).

This makes `rem` calculations straightforward, as 1 `rem` becomes 10 pixels. However, this method primarily benefits developers by simplifying calculations. It does not automatically adapt if users change their browser's default font size for accessibility reasons, potentially impacting user experience if not handled carefully. Therefore, while useful for development, it's important to consider accessibility and user preferences when deciding whether to use this approach in your design.

( \text{User's Font Size} \times 0.625 = 10 \text{px} )
