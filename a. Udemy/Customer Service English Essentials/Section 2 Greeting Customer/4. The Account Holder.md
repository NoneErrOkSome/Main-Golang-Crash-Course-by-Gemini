### **A Guide to Confirming Customer Information**

This guide covers essential techniques for politely confirming a customer's identity and handling situations where a third party is calling on their behalf. Following these steps ensures you maintain account security while building trust and rapport with the caller.

---

#### **1. Verifying You Are Speaking with the Account Holder**

For security and privacy, your first step is often to confirm you are speaking with the registered owner of the account. It's crucial to do this politely.

##### **The Polite Way to Ask**

Instead of a blunt question like "Are you the account holder?", a more professional and polite phrasing is recommended.

> **"Am I speaking with the account holder?"**

This phrasing feels more respectful and less like an interrogation.

**Examples:**

- "Thank you for providing that. First, could you confirm for me, **am I speaking with the account holder?**"
- "To proceed, I'll need to verify a few details. **Am I speaking with the owner of the account?**"

#### **2. Managing Third-Party Callers: A Step-by-Step Guide**

It's common for a friend or family member to call on behalf of the account holder, perhaps due to a language barrier or other reasons. Follow this process to handle the situation securely.

**Scenario:** The account holder is present but has asked her friend, Steve, to speak for her.

##### **Step 1: Identify that the caller is not the account holder.**

After you ask, "Am I speaking with the account holder?", the caller may respond:

> _"No, actually, I'm her friend. My name is Steve. She's right here but asked me to help explain the issue."_

##### **Step 2: Politely ask to speak with the account holder for authorization.**

You must get the account holder's direct permission to proceed.

> **"Could you put her on the phone for a moment?"**

**Variations & Examples:**

- "I understand, thank you for letting me know. To continue, **could you put her on the phone for a moment?** I just need to get her approval."
- "No problem at all. **Could you just put her on the line for a moment?** I need to confirm she's there."
- "I'm happy to speak with you, Steve. First, I'll need to get a quick verbal confirmation from the account holder. **Could you put her on for me, please?**"

##### **Step 3: Confirm identity and get permission from the account holder.**

Once the account holder is on the line, repeat your verification and ask for consent.

**Example Dialogue:**

> **You:** "Hello, am I speaking with the account holder?"
> 
> **Account Holder:** "Yes, this is she."
> 
> **You:** "Great, thank you. **Is it okay if I talk with your friend, Steve, about the reason you're calling today?**"
> 
> **Account Holder:** "Yes, that's fine."

##### **Step 4: Ask for the third party to return to the call.**

Once you have permission, you can invite the original caller back. The word "back" is used because they were on the line previously.

> **"Thank you. You can put him back on the line now."**

**Variations & Examples:**

- "Perfect, thank you for confirming. **You can put him back on the phone now.**"
- "I appreciate that. Please feel free to **put him back on.**"

#### **3. Handling and Confirming Names**

Correctly using a customer's name is a sign of respect. These techniques help when you are unsure of a name.

##### **When a Name is Difficult to Pronounce**

If you see a name on the account that you are unsure how to pronounce (e.g., Enrique), it is polite to ask for guidance.

> **"What can I call you?"**

This open-ended question allows the person to say their name in their own voice, which you can then try to emulate. It's also polite to show you're trying.

**Example Dialogue:**

> **You:** "I see the name on the account is... **is it Enrique? Am I saying that correctly?**"
> 
> **Caller:** "It's actually En-REE-kay, but it's a bit difficult. You can just call me Rick."
> 
> **You:** "Okay, Rick, thank you for that. Now, how can I help?"

##### **When You Don't Know the Caller's Name**

In the third-party scenario, you need to ask for the caller's name (Steve). A very common and natural way to transition to this new question in customer service is by starting with "And."

> **"And what is your name?"**

Using "And" here doesn't function in the traditional grammatical sense; instead, it acts as a soft conversational bridge to a new topic or request.

**Examples:**

- (After getting permission from the account holder) "Okay, thank you. **And what is your name?**"

> _"My name is Steve Robinson."_

- (After verifying an account number) "Perfect, that's all verified. **And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?**"
- (After confirming you can help) "I can certainly look into that for you. **And what name can I call you by?**"

> _"You can call me Steve."_
> 
> **You:** "Okay, thank you, Steve. Now, please tell me about the issue."
