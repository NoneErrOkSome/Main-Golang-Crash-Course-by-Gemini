Of course. Here is an in-depth guide based on the transcript, refined into a structured document with extensive examples to illustrate how to ask for more information, specifically about time.

### **A Guide to Asking for More Information: Focusing on Time**

This guide focuses on techniques for gathering more information from a customer, specifically concerning the timeline of events. Understanding _when_ an issue occurred or _how long_ it has been happening is often critical to resolving it effectively.

#### **Introduction: The Case Study**

To frame these expressions, consider this scenario:

- **Your Company:** You work for a service that prepares and reviews documents for visa applications to ensure they are complete and error-free.
- **The Situation:** A customer who used your service has just informed you that their visa application was **declined** (refused).
- **Your Goal:** You need to gather more information about the timeline to understand what might have gone wrong.

#### **1. Asking About Duration and Elapsed Time ("How long...?")**

This question form is essential for understanding the length of a situation or the time that has passed since a key event.

##### **A. For Ongoing Situations**

Use this when an issue began in the past and is still continuing. This often uses the present perfect tense.

> "How long have you been having this issue?"
> 
> "How long has this issue been going on?"

**Examples:**

- (For a technical problem) "I understand your internet is slow. **How long have you been having this issue?**"
- (For a billing dispute) "You mentioned a recurring incorrect charge. **How long has this been going on?**"
- (For a product defect) "Okay, the device isn't turning on. **How long have you been experiencing this?**"

##### **B. Since a Specific Past Event**

Use this to measure the time that has passed from a specific point until now.

> **"How long has it been since...?"**

**Examples from the case study:**

- The customer's application was declined, and they likely received a **notice** (an official notification). You need to know when.
    
    > "I'm very sorry to hear that. **How long has it been since you received the notice** that the application was declined?"
    
- This is crucial because if they received it two months ago, the resolution might be different than if it happened yesterday.

**Other Examples:**

- "**How long has it been since** you last successfully logged into your account?"
- "**How long has it been since** you placed the order?"

#### **2. Asking About Specific Points in Time ("When...?")**

Use "When" to ask about a single, specific moment in timeâ€”the start, end, or occurrence of an event.

> **"When did you...?"**

**Examples from the case study:**

- It's important to know when the customer sent the application _after_ your company's review, as rules could have changed in the interim.
    
    > "I see. **When did you actually send the application** to the visa agency?"
    
- You might need to know when the customer first became aware of the problem. Here, "notice" is used as a verb (to become aware of).
    
    > "**When did you first notice the issue** with the document?"
    

**Other Examples:**

- "**When did this charge first appear** on your statement?"
- "**When did the error message start** appearing?"
- "**When were you expecting the delivery** to arrive?"

#### **3. Adding Focus with the Word "Actually"**

While not required, adding the word "actually" to your question provides focus and emphasizes the specific action you're asking about. It strengthens the question without changing its meaning.

It can be used with many question words: **When, Where, Why, Who, How.**

**Examples with "When":**

- "**When did you _actually_ send the application?**" (Emphasizes the action of sending).
- "I know you called last week, but **when did you _actually_ speak to a technician?**"

**Examples with other question words:**

- **Where:** "The delivery was left at the front door, but **where did you _actually_ find the package?**"
- **Who:** "The email says it was approved by a manager, but **who did you _actually_ speak with?**"
- **How:** "You tried to restart it, but **how did you _actually_ perform the reset?**"
- **Why:** "The system flagged it for review, but **why did you _actually_ think it was an error?**"

Using "actually" helps ensure the customer understands precisely what you're asking, leading to a clearer, more accurate answer.
