### **A Guide to Politely Confirming Customer Information**

This guide focuses on the crucial skill of verifying information you have on file. Before you proceed with a customer's request, you must ensure your records are accurate. These techniques will help you confirm details in a way that is polite, professional, and reassuring for the customer.

#### **1. The Two-Step Confirmation Method**

This is a clear and structured formula for verifying a piece of information. It involves stating what you believe to be true and then politely asking for confirmation.

##### **Step 1: State What Your Records Show**

Begin by referencing your information source. Using a neutral term like "my records" is preferable to "your profile," which can sometimes make customers feel uncomfortable.

> **"My records say..."** or **"My records show..."**

**Examples:**

- "**My records show** that you sent the application on October 5th."
- "**My records say** the email address we have on file is example@email.com."
- "**My records indicate** that your current service plan is the 'Premium' package."

##### **Step 2: Ask for Polite Confirmation**

After stating the information, ask a simple, positive question to confirm its accuracy.

|**Recommended Phrases**|**Phrases to Avoid**|
|**"Is that correct?"**|**"Is that true?"** (This can sound accusatory, as if you suspect they are lying.)|
|**"Is that right?"**||

**Putting It All Together (Full Examples):**

- "**My records show that you sent the application on October 5th. Is that correct?**"
- "**My records say the delivery address is 123 Main Street. Is that right?**"

##### **Optional: Adding a Polite Preamble**

To make the exchange even more comfortable, you can add a soft introduction before you begin the two-step process.

> **"I just want to make sure..."**

**Examples with the Preamble:**

- "**I just want to make sure I have the right date.** My records show you sent the application on October 5th. Is that correct?"
- "**I just want to make sure we're sending this to the right place.** My records show the shipping address is 123 Main Street. Is that right?"

#### **2. The All-in-One Confirmation Method**

For a simpler, more streamlined approach, you can combine the statement and the question into a single, elegant phrase. This is a very common and friendly way to confirm details.

> **"Could I just confirm that...?"**

This phrase is highly effective because it's inherently polite and gets straight to the point without feeling abrupt.

**Key Points:**

- The word **"just"** is very common, especially in American customer service. It softens the question and adds a feeling of friendliness.
- This formula works for almost any piece of information you need to verify.

**Examples:**

- (From the case study) "**Could I just confirm that** you applied for a spousal visa?"
- (Confirming an action) "**Could I just confirm that** you've already tried restarting your router?"
- (Confirming a detail) "**Could I just confirm that** the name on the account is spelled S-M-I-T-H?"
- (Confirming a transaction) "**Could I just confirm that** the last payment you made was on June 10th?"
- (Confirming contact info) "**Could I just confirm that** the best phone number to reach you at is the one you're calling from now?"

Both the two-step method and the all-in-one method are excellent tools. Choose the one that feels most natural for you and the situation. The ultimate goal is to work with accurate information while ensuring the customer feels respected and well-cared-for.
