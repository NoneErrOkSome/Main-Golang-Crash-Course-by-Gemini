### **A Guide to Getting Specific Details from Customers**

This guide provides essential techniques for requesting precise information—such as numbers, codes, or specific wording—from a customer. The core principle is that to _get_ specific answers, you must _ask_ specific questions, all while ensuring the customer feels guided and not confused.

#### **1. The Core Principle: Prevent Customer Frustration with Clarity**

Remember, while you handle these situations daily, it may be the customer's first time. They are not experts in your procedures and can easily become frustrated if they don't understand what you're asking for.

- **Your Goal:** Be as specific as possible in your questions to guide the customer directly to the information you need. This clarity prevents confusion and builds their confidence.

#### **2. Techniques for Asking for Detailed Information**

Here are key phrases and strategies to elicit precise details.

##### **A. Getting Verbatim Information from a Document**

When you need a customer to read something exactly as it's written, use the continuous tense ("are you seeing") to subconsciously encourage them to perform the action of reading in that moment.

> **"What are you seeing on the notice itself?"**

**Examples:**

- "Okay, please pick up the letter from the agency. **What are you seeing on the notice itself?** I need the exact wording."
- "When the error message appears, **what exactly are you seeing on your screen?**"
- "I understand the application was declined. **What reason are you seeing listed** in the first paragraph?"

##### **B. Pinpointing a Specific Source or Location**

Avoid vague questions like "Where did you get it from?" which could lead to unhelpful answers like "the mailbox." Use "Which" to ask for a specific choice from a set of possibilities.

> "Specifically, which office did you receive the notice from?"
> 
> "Which specific office did you get the notice from?"

**Key Points:**

- **"Which" vs. "Where":** "Which" narrows the focus to a specific item or location.
- **"Receive" vs. "Get":** "Receive" feels more polite and respectful, while "get" can sound sharp or too casual.
- **Adding "Specific/Specifically":** Use these words to further emphasize that you need a precise answer.

**Examples:**

- "There are several departments that handle these requests. **Which specific department** sent the email?"
- "To identify the product, I need the model number. **Which number** are you seeing on the back of the device?"
- "**Specifically, which error code** is displayed on the screen?"

##### **C. The Universal Polite Request: "Could you tell me...?"**

This is perhaps the most versatile and polite phrase for requesting almost any piece of information. It is soft, respectful, and can be adapted to nearly any situation.

> **"Could you tell me...?"**

**Examples:**

- (Requesting a number) "**Could you tell me the reference number** on the top left corner of the form?"
- (Requesting a username) "**Could you tell me your username, please?**"
- (Requesting a model number) "**Could you tell me the model number** printed on the sticker on the bottom of the laptop?"
- (Requesting specific text) "**Could you tell me what the notice says** in the section marked 'Reason for Decision'?"

#### **3. Guiding the Customer with Clear Instructions**

Your responsibility is to be the expert guide. When asking for information from a complex document or device, provide clear directional cues.

**Best Practices:**

- Use location words: **top left corner, bottom right, in the middle, on the back, under the barcode.**
- Refer to landmarks: **next to the logo, in the section with the bold heading.**

##### **Clarity in Action: Good vs. Better Questions**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Good (but could be confusing)**|**Better (Specific and Clear)**|
|"Could you tell me the number on the form?"|"**Could you tell me the case number located in the top left corner of the form?**"|
|"What's the model number?"|"**Could you tell me the model number? It's usually on a small white sticker on the back of the device.**"|
|"Tell me the error code."|"**What error code are you seeing? It should start with the letter E, followed by four numbers.**"|

By being precise in your own language, you empower the customer to find the right information quickly, making the entire interaction smoother and more positive.
