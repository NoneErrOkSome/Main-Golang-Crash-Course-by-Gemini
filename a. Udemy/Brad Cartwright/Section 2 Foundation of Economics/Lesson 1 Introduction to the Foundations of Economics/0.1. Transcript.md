Alright, class, let's dive into this first video, the foundations of economics. And right out of the gate, I want to make this super clear for you. What exactly _is_ the study of economics? You hear everybody talking about it, economics, economics, but what _is_ it?

Okay, it's actually a **philosophy**. Remember this for the rest of your life. The first economist, the one who really laid the groundwork that the Western world accepted, Adam Smith, with his book "The Wealth of Nations" in 1776 – he was a philosopher. He was studying **human behavior**, okay? He looked around, saw the Industrial Revolution happening in England, and made a philosophical statement about what he observed.

So, what did he do? He looked at how _you_ behave, how _I_ behave. He collected data on people. And he looked at the resources on Earth and realized, "Man, there's not enough of everything people want." So, logically, people have to pay for things. And the price? Well, that depends on decisions people make.

Ultimately, economics is the study of **you**. It's how you behave when you go into a store, when you want to buy something. It's also how you behave if you're the one producing something. And who's involved? Consumers (that's you and me when we're buying), producers (the folks making the stuff), and yes, the government is a third party involved. But at its heart, it's a philosophy of **how we behave**.

Now, let's look at the big picture. Economics is a **social science**. It's about how people interact. Key concept here: we _think_. We're not robots, right? So, individual behavior isn't always totally predictable. But here's the cool part – large group behavior? Actually quite predictable, and therefore, quote, "study-able." Yeah, we all like to think we're super unique, and on an individual level, sure. But put enough of us together, especially in an economic sense, and we act pretty similarly. That's what Adam Smith figured out, and it formed the philosophical backbone for studying our economic behavior.

So, here's the core logic, the solid truth of it:

1. Earth has **limited resources**.
2. These resources are used to produce goods and services.
3. People have **infinite wants and needs**.
4. Therefore, there's a fundamental conflict between those finite resources and our infinite desires.
5. Since we can't have everything we want – nope, we can't! – resources **must be rationed** somehow.

And drum roll please... that's where economics comes in! It's the study of **how scarce resources are allocated to fulfill what?** Wait for it... **infinite wants and needs** of you and me. Because, let's be honest, a primary thing we do in this life is walk around, buy stuff, make decisions to buy.

Now, you absolutely _must_ know these core economic terms. Get your pen out, write these down, or access the notes provided. This is like learning a new language, folks. You've got to know the definitions because in economics, words don't always mean what you _think_ they might mean. Be careful! You gotta quiz yourself, go crazy, make sure you know these for any assessment.

Here are the five really, really important ones we'll talk about constantly:

1. **Goods:** Physical objects you can touch. Like this Mate I'm drinking – beautiful, delicious T from South America. I can pick it up, drink it. That's a good.
2. **Services:** Intangible things you cannot touch. Motorcycle repairs, a haircut, insurance, or hey, this online course right here! Education is a service. You can't pick this up and carry it around, right?
3. **Wants:** Things we'd like, but aren't necessary for immediate physical survival. iPhones, televisions. Let's face it, we don't _need_ that stuff. Most of what we consume are actually wants, not needs.
4. **Needs:** Things you absolutely need to survive – food, shelter, clothing.
5. **Resources:** Goods used to produce other goods. We'll get into this soon, but think land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship – those are the factors of production. Everything needed to make _anything_, whether it's this course, an app, or a wooden table.

So there it is. Those are the main things you need for your studies in microeconomics: what economics is generally, and those five key terms. Know what they mean, be able to precisely regurgitate those definitions.

Keep going! Economics provides such an understanding of how the world operates. You got this.
