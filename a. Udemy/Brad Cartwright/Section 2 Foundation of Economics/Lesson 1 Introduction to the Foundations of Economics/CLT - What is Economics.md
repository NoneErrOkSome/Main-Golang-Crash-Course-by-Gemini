Welcome to your first lesson on the foundations of economics. The goal of this lesson is to introduce the core concepts of this field in a way that manages its inherent difficulty, keeps the explanations simple and clear, and encourages deep thinking to help you build a strong mental model of how economics works.

### **1. Managing the Core Idea: What is Economics?**

To begin, let's use a simple analogy. Think of an economist as a detective of human behavior1. The first great economics detective was a Scottish philosopher named Adam Smith2. In 1776, while observing the massive changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in England, he acted like a detective3. He observed people, collected data on how they behaved when they produced and bought things, and looked for patterns4. This investigation led to his book,

_The Wealth of Nations_, and formed the foundation of modern microeconomics5.

From this, we get our first key concept, broken down into two parts:

- **Economics is a Philosophy**: At its heart, it is the study of human behavior6. It asks questions about why we make the choices we do7.
    
- **Economics is a Social Science**: It specifically studies how people interact with each other8. While it's impossible to predict what one single person will do, economists have found that the behavior of large groups of people is actually very predictable and can be studied effectively9.

#### **Active Processing:**

Think about a store you visited recently. What did you buy? What did you consider buying but decide against? Your decision-making process—what you chose to buy and what you chose to leave behind—is exactly the kind of human behavior that economics seeks to understand10.

### **2. Minimizing Complexity: The Central Problem of Economics**

The fundamental logic of economics is built on a conflict. To make this easy to understand, we can break it down into a clear, sequential flow.

- **Fact 1: Limited Resources**
    
    - The Earth has a finite, or limited, amount of resources11. These resources are what we use to produce everything around us12.
        
- **Fact 2: Unlimited Wants**
    
    - People, on the other hand, have infinite wants and needs13. We almost always desire more than we currently have14.
        
- **The Conflict: Scarcity**
    
    - Because there is a limited amount of "stuff" to fulfill an unlimited amount of desire, we have a problem15. We simply cannot have everything we want16.
        
- **The Solution: Rationing**
    
    - Because of this scarcity, resources must be divided up or rationed in some way17.
        

This leads us to the formal definition of economics:

**Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated to fulfill the infinite wants and needs of people**18.

#### **Active Processing:**

Imagine you have two hours of free time tonight. You _want_ to watch a movie (which takes two hours) and also _want_ to finish a chapter in a book (which takes one hour). You have a scarce resource (time) and multiple wants. How do you allocate your time? You are making an economic decision.

### **3. Maximizing Understanding: The Basic Vocabulary**

To study economics, you must learn its language19. The terms used often have very precise meanings that can be different from how we use them in daily life20. Here are five core concepts you must know.

- **Goods**
    
    - **Definition:** These are physical, tangible objects that can be touched21.
        
    - **Example:** A table, a pen, or a cup of tea are all goods22.
        
- **Services**
    
    - **Definition:** These are intangible things that cannot be touched23. You receive a benefit, but you cannot physically hold the thing you paid for.
        
    - **Examples:** A haircut, a motorcycle repair, an insurance policy, or this online course are all services24.
        
- **Wants**
    
    - **Definition:** These are things we would like to have but are not necessary for our immediate physical survival25.
        
    - **Examples:** iPhones and televisions. Most things we consume on a daily basis are wants, not needs26.
        
- **Needs**
    
    - **Definition:** These are things that are essential for survival27.
        
    - **Examples:** Food, shelter, and clothing28.
        
- **Resources**
    
    - **Definition:** These are the goods and services used to produce _other_ goods and services29. They are often called the
        
        **factors of production**30.
        
    - **Examples:** The four main factors of production are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. These four categories encompass everything needed to produce any good or service in the world31.

#### **Active Processing:**

1. Look around the room you are in. Identify three distinct **goods**.
    
2. Think about your day so far. Identify two **services** you have used or benefited from.
    
3. Compare your smartphone (a **want**) with the food you ate for breakfast (a **need**). Why does economics make this distinction?
    

Knowing these five terms is the first step to mastering the language of economics and understanding the world in a new, powerful way32.
