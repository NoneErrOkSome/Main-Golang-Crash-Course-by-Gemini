### 🎓 **You're Learning a New Language**

Economics isn’t just facts and figures — it’s a **new way of thinking**.

> Just like learning French, Japanese, or coding, economics has its own vocabulary, structure, and logic.

✅ That’s why terms like **goods**, **services**, **wants**, **needs**, and **resources** matter.  
They don’t always mean what you think — so you have to **relearn** familiar words in an **economic context**.

### 📚 **Study Tips**

To master economics:

- **Memorize key terms** – precision matters!
    
- **Quiz yourself regularly** – repetition builds fluency.
    
- **Think logically** – follow the reasoning, not just definitions.
    
- **Apply concepts to real life** – economics is everywhere: when you shop, work, save, or choose.
