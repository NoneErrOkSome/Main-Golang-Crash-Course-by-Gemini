2. Analyze how the predictability of large group behavior, despite the unpredictability of individual behavior, allows economists to study and understand economic systems.
3. Explain the significance of differentiating between goods and services, and wants and needs, within the study of economics.
4. Describe the role of the factors of production in the creation of goods and services and how their scarcity impacts economic decision-making.

**Answer Key (Quiz)**

1. Economics is a social science because it studies how people interact with each other, focusing on their behavior and decision-making.
2. While individuals think and their specific actions can vary, large groups of people exhibit more predictable patterns of behavior that economists can analyze.
3. The fundamental conflict in economics is the clash between the earth's limited resources and people's seemingly infinite wants and needs.
4. Because people cannot have everything they want due to limited resources, scarcity requires that resources be divided or distributed through some method of rationing.
5. A good is a tangible physical object, such as a vegetable or a motorcar, that can be touched and used.
6. A service is an intangible action or activity that cannot be touched, such as a haircut or insurance coverage.
7. Wants are things people desire but are not essential for survival, while needs are things people must have to survive, like food and shelter.
8. The four main factors of production are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship (or management).
9. Economics attempts to address the basic economic problem of how to allocate scarce resources to satisfy infinite wants in the face of this fundamental conflict.
10. The primary focus of economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated to fulfill the infinite wants of consumers.
