## 📚 **Part 1 – Foundations of Economics**

---

### 🔍 **What is Economics?**

Economics is not just about money, charts, and government budgets. It **originates from philosophy** — it is the **study of human behavior** in relation to how we **deal with scarcity** and make **choices**.

The key idea:

> **Economics is the study of how individuals and societies use limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants and needs.**

### 📜 **Historical Roots: Adam Smith – The Philosopher**

- The **first recognized Western economist** is **Adam Smith**, a **Scottish philosopher**.
    
- In **1776**, he published a foundational book titled:
    
    > **"The Wealth of Nations"**  
    > This is considered the birth of modern **Microeconomics**.
    

Adam Smith didn’t call himself an economist — that word barely existed in this context.  
He was simply a **philosopher** observing the world, especially the **Industrial Revolution** in England.

He noticed patterns in how people behave with money, resources, and production.  
He asked big questions like:

- “Who decides what gets produced?”
    
- “Why do people pay for things?”
    
- “What determines the price?”
    

Instead of offering personal opinions, he made **logical observations** based on **real human behavior**.

### 🧭 **Economics as Philosophy of Behavior**

Smith saw economics as a **philosophical framework** to explain:

- Why people produce
    
- Why people consume
    
- How decisions are made in a society
    

This is why economics is classified as a **social science** — it analyzes how humans interact with each other, make decisions, and respond to incentives.

### 🧪 **From Philosophy to Data**

Adam Smith and other early economists began with ideas, but they **backed them up with data**:

- Observing people like **you and me**
    
- Noting the patterns in behavior across **societies**
    
- Comparing needs with available **resources on Earth**
    

This transition from philosophy to analysis is what made economics a modern discipline.

### 🔄 **Key Takeaway**

> Economics = The philosophy + logic + behavior + observation of how we deal with scarcity.

It’s not just about numbers — it’s about **you**, **me**, and how we **interact with the world** when we **buy**, **sell**, or **produce** anything.
