## 📝 **Part 5 – Core Economic Terms: Goods, Services, Wants, Needs, and Resources**

---

These **five core terms** form the foundation of economic vocabulary. Understanding them is like learning the **alphabet of economics** — you’ll use them constantly.

---

### 📦 **1. Goods**

> **Goods** are **physical**, **tangible** items that can be **touched, held, or stored**.

Examples:

- A table
    
- A bottle of water
    
- A mobile phone
    
- A bag of rice
    

Goods are **produced**, **traded**, and **consumed**. You can literally pick them up and take them with you.

🧉 _Example from the video_: “Mate” (a popular tea in South America) — it’s a **good** because you can pick it up and drink it.

---

### 🛠 **2. Services**

> **Services** are **intangible** activities provided by others to satisfy needs or wants.

You **can’t touch** a service, but you **experience** it.

Examples:

- Haircut 💇‍♂️
    
- Car repair 🔧
    
- Insurance policy 📄
    
- Online course 💻 (like this economics video!)
    

Education is a service — it has value, but it doesn’t physically exist in your hands.

---

### 💭 **3. Wants**

> **Wants** are things we **desire** but **don’t need** to survive.

Examples:

- iPhones
    
- Netflix
    
- Designer clothing
    
- Video games
    

Most things people buy fall under **wants**. They improve comfort or fun, but aren’t required to live.

---

### 🧊 **4. Needs**

> **Needs** are things that are **essential for survival**.

Examples:

- Food 🍞
    
- Water 💧
    
- Shelter 🏠
    
- Clothing 👕
    

Without these, we cannot live. Economists clearly separate **wants** (optional) from **needs** (essential).

---

### 🏗 **5. Resources**

> **Resources** are the **inputs** used to produce goods and services.  
> They are also called **Factors of Production** and fall into four categories:

|Resource Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Land**|Natural resources (soil, water, minerals)|
|**Labor**|Human effort (workers, skills)|
|**Capital**|Tools, machines, buildings (not money itself)|
|**Entrepreneurship**|The creativity and risk-taking to organize production|

Resources are **limited**, and that's why economics is needed — to decide how to use them best.

---

### 📚 **Term Comparison Chart**

|Term|Tangible?|Needed to Survive?|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Goods|✅ Yes|❌ Not always|Chair, iPhone|
|Services|❌ No|❌ Not always|Education, repair|
|Wants|❓ Maybe|❌ No|Vacation, game|
|Needs|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|Water, shelter|
|Resources|✅/❌ Mix|✅ For production|Land, labor|

### 🧠 **Final Thoughts**

Mastering these terms gives you the **language of economics**. You’ll use these definitions constantly, so **memorize them clearly and precisely**.

> Think of it as learning the **grammar** of how the economic world works.
