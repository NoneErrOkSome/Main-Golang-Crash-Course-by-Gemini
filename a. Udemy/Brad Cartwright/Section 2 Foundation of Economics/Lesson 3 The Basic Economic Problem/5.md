## 🏛️ Part 5: Free Market vs Planned Economy

> Now that we’ve seen how individuals make economic decisions, we zoom out and ask: **Who makes these decisions in a larger system?**

This brings us to the **two main types of economic systems**.

---

### ⚖️ 1. **Free Market Economy**

> 📌 In a free market, **individuals** and **businesses** decide:

|Economic Question|Who Decides?|
|---|---|
|**What to produce?**|Producers (businesses/people)|
|**How to produce it?**|Producers|
|**For whom to produce?**|The market (based on demand)|

---

#### ✅ Characteristics:

- **Decentralized decision-making**
    
- Driven by **supply and demand**
    
- **Prices** guide production choices
    
- People **freely choose** what to buy and sell
    

#### 💡 Real-life Example:

> The **Cornershop** example is a free market case —  
> they built a business based on what they thought people wanted, using the tools they chose.

### 🏢 2. **Planned (Command) Economy**

> 📌 In a planned economy, the **government or central authority** decides:

|Economic Question|Who Decides?|
|---|---|
|**What to produce?**|Government planners|
|**How to produce it?**|Government instructions|
|**For whom to produce?**|Often based on equality or need|

---

#### 🛠️ Characteristics:

- **Centralized planning**
    
- Government allocates **resources**
    
- Often found in **communist or socialist systems**
    
- Individuals have **less economic freedom**

### 📊 Comparing the Two:

|Feature|Free Market|Planned Economy|
|---|---|---|
|Decision Makers|Individuals / Businesses|Government / Central Planners|
|Flexibility|High — responds to demand|Low — slow to adapt|
|Innovation|High — competition fuels it|Lower — less incentive to innovate|
|Example from Transcript|Cornershop grocery service|None given, but implied contrast|

### 🧠 Why It Matters:

> Understanding **who controls the economic process** is central to economics.  
> Whether **you** decide or the **government** decides changes everything about how resources are used.

### 🔑 Final Thought from This Part:

> “How and who makes these decisions, though, is key to economic study.”

Economics isn’t just about money — it’s about **decision-making** systems.
