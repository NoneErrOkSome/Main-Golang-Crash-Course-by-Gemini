Okay, let's take those foundational concepts of scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and utility and see how they apply to anyone who wants to create or make something â€“ a producer.

Think about it from the perspective of anyone starting a business, from a huge car company like Ford to someone just selling lemonade. They all face the same fundamental set of questions that economists call the **basic economic problem**. It's less of a "problem" and more of a core process they have to figure out to make smart decisions.

These questions are pretty straightforward:

1. **What to produce?** The first thing you have to decide is, well, what are you going to make or offer? Are you going to make cars, provide a grocery delivery service, or sell lemonade? You have to choose what product or service you're going to bring into the world.
    
2. **How to produce?** Once you know what you want to make, you need to figure out the best way to actually make it. What resources will you use? What methods or technology? Will you need a factory, an app, or just lemons, sugar, and water? This is about the production process itself.
    
3. **For whom to produce?** Finally, you need to decide who your customers will be. Who are you making this for? Who wants or needs this product or service? Are you targeting people who want convenience, people walking by on a hot day, or a specific group of consumers?
    

Every producer, big or small, has to answer these three questions. It might seem simple, but these decisions are crucial for success.

The transcript also touched on an important point: _who_ answers these questions depends on the type of economic system. In a **free market**, individuals and businesses make these decisions based on demand and supply. In a **planned economy**, the government makes the decisions about what will be produced, how it will be produced, and who will receive it.

So, the basic economic problem boils down to these essential questions that producers must answer to decide what to make, how to make it, and who they are making it for, all within the reality of scarce resources and unlimited wants.
