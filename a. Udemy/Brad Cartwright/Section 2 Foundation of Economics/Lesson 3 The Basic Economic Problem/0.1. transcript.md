Alright, so we've got scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and utility built into our vocabulary now. Excellent.

Now we're gonna apply it to this very simple yet foundational understanding of what producers have to process – the process any producer _must_ go through to produce _anything_. And economists have taken the kind of "conundrum" – though I think that's a poor name for it because it's not a problem, it's a _process_ – for anybody who wants to go into business. Whether you're Henry Ford making cars or you just want to have a lemonade stand in front of your house, you actually go through the exact same process.

It's called the **basic economic problem**, though I prefer to think of it as the basic economic _process_ through which a producer must go to make good decisions about what to produce.

Okay, so here's what it is. And it's actually quite simple, right? If you're going to make something, you gotta figure out:

1. **What should I make?**
2. Then you're like, "Okay, so **how am I going to make that?**"
3. And then it's like, "Okay, well, **for whom might want to buy it?**"

There you get it! Is that hard? No, not really. But it's actually so simple that you might not even realize that it's occurring, right?

A great example is Cornershop here in Santiago. What did they do? They decided:

1. **What** to produce? A service – a grocery shopping service.
2. **How?** Through an app on a phone or computer.
3. **For whom?** People like me! Man, if I buy the same things over and over at the grocery store, maybe I don't have to go there every time. (Though I actually like going sometimes!). For people like me, who it changed my life, right? I am the "for whom."

They figured out how to get that service to me using an app, and the "what" is the shopping service itself. Pretty amazing.

If I wanted to sell lemonade outside my house here in Santiago, what would I do?

1. **What** would I make? Lemonade.
2. **How?** Get some lemons, sugar, water.
3. **For whom?** Anybody coming by! If they're going for a hike in the hills, maybe they want some lemonade. I can stand by my house and call out, "Hey, hey, do you want to buy some lemonade?"

So, the basic economic problem – you intuitively get this! And you'll see as we go through microeconomics, you'll intuitively understand this stuff. The difficult part is actually taking it, graphing it, and then writing about it.

Okay, so that's the basic economic problem. And how and who makes these decisions is key to economic study. Because what I was just explaining with Cornershop or the lemonade stand? That's **free markets**.

There are two theoretical economic systems:

- **Free market:** Where we, as individuals, can decide _what_ to produce, _how_ to produce, and _for whom_.
- Then there are also **planned economies**. In a planned economy, there's some sort of government agency that is making these decisions – _what_ to produce, _how_ to produce, and _for whom_ to produce.

Okay? Again, look at that – more foundational information going into your head for you to continue to grow your understanding of economics.

Alright, here we go, onto the next!
