Alright, now we're moving into another way economists think, and this video and the next are very much related. This video is all about the idea that **economists build models**. Why do they do this? Because, let's be honest, it's impossible to grasp all the information going on in an economy at any given time. It's just too abstract and there are too many things to count up.

So, model building is a fundamental thing economists do to take really abstract concepts and bring them down to a reasonable size. A model can be a graph, like our supply and demand graph we'll get to – that's a model of what would happen. We're going to use something called the **Circular Flow Model** in the next video, which will give us kind of an aerial view of how an economy works, and that perfectly illustrates this point: economists are model builders.

Economists tend to build these theoretical models specifically to **test and illustrate their theories**. Now, one of the absolutely crucial things they must do when building these models is something called **ceteris paribus**. You need to repeat this over and over: **Ceteris paribus! Ceteris paribus! Ceteris paribus!** It's going to come up in a lot of definitions.

What does it mean? **Ceteris paribus is Latin for "all other things being equal"**. Remember how I said economists often take snapshots of the economy to study? That's because it's impossible to change or move two variables at a time. To really understand the effect of one thing on another, economists need to **isolate the effect of that one variable** by assuming that _everything else_ stays exactly the same. This is a key concept.

Economists are really famous for making assumptions, and it's always important to be aware of them. For example, if we're looking at consumers or producers, and there's a change in price, we're only going to look at that one change. We won't simultaneously consider consumers doing one thing _and_ producers doing another at the exact same time. If the government imposes a tax, we're going to take a snapshot of the impact on producers, boom, move that supply curve, and then study just that isolated effect.

A big example we'll get into is the **Circular Flow of Income Model**. Imagine we're looking down at the map of a country, watching all the economic activity – people, trucks, trains, planes, building. We take all that complex activity and build a model, the circular flow, to make sense of it.

This simple model, which we'll detail, illustrates how **Households** (the groups of individuals) are both the consumers of goods and services _and_ the owners/providers of the factors of production (land, labor, capital, management). And **Firms** are the productive units that take those factors of production and turn them into goods and services. Goods are tangible products, like cars (durable) or ice cream (non-durable). Services are intangible, like a haircut or insurance.

Now, this _simple_ circular flow model initially ignores two absolutely important sectors: the **government** and **international trade**. The government has many roles – law and order, national defense, adjusting the economy, and even providing certain goods and services directly. The state-owned part of the economy that provides these is called the **public sector**. We'll add these complexities later to get a fuller picture.

So, make sure you understand this concept of model building. And here's the fascinating part, in my opinion, what makes economics so cool: these models are inherently flawed because they're based on assumptions. But it's precisely this fact – that you're making assumptions about humanity that are inherently flawed – that leads to so much understanding and such rich conversations and a wide variety of thoughts.

Alright, so next, we'll really dig into the Circular Flow of Income Model!
