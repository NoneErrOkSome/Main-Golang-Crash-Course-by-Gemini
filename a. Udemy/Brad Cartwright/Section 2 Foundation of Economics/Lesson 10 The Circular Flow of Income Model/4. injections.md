In the circular flow model, **injections** are the opposite of leakages; they are ways that money is added or "injected" back into the circular flow of income within an economy. As the instructor puts it, if leakages are money breaking out of a pipe, injections are "you would inject water into the pipe" â€“ or in this case, "money into the system".

The instructor details three main ways money is injected back into the system:

1. Investment (from the Banking Sector):
    
    When households save money by depositing it in banks (a leakage), that money doesn't simply disappear from the economy. Banks, being "in business to sell money," take these savings. They then "take those savings and they take a certain percentage of it... and they do what they offer out loans to businesses." These loans to businesses are considered an injection into the circular flow model, meaning "some of that 20 dollars goes back in," and "now it's floating around". This represents firms borrowing money for capital expenditure, which re-enters the spending stream.
    
2. Government Spending (from the Government Sector):
    
    The money collected by the government through taxes (a leakage) is used for "government spending" on "public goods." The instructor provides several examples of how this money is injected back into the economy: building "this most beautiful skate park," paying "teachers," providing "health care," funding "militaries," and covering costs for "streetlights, national parks, airports." All the money the government spends on these public goods and services is an injection back into the economy. As he explains, "my 20 dollars left the system, but now it's being injected back in," for instance, "my taxes are being used to help the public good by maybe paying for national health care system".
    
3. Exports (from the Foreign Sector):
    
    Money is also injected into the domestic circular flow when goods and services produced domestically are sold to individuals or entities outside the country. The instructor gives the example of a "Chilena" living in New York City who buys Chilean wine. Even though she earned her money in the United States, when she spends "$20 dollars of her money... she buys the wine... where does that money that she spent on the Chilean wine actually go right back into... the circular flow model of what country? Chile." He clarifies, "exports are injections because the wine while the wine went to the United States, what came back? US dollars change in the pesos. And that was an injection into the Chilean economy". This highlights the crucial point that when tracking injections (and leakages), the focus is always on the flow of money into or out of the specific country's economy, not the movement of the goods themselves.
