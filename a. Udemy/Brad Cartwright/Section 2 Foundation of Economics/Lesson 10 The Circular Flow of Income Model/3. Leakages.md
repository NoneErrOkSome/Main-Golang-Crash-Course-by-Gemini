In the circular flow model, **leakages** refer to the money that "leaks out" or exits the immediate circular flow between households and firms. As the instructor explains, these are instances where money "broke out" of the pipe, meaning it's no longer directly circulating for expenditure on domestically produced goods and services.

The instructor illustrates these leakages using his $100 daily pay:

1. Savings (to the Banking Sector):
    
    After earning his $100, the instructor "stop[s] by the bank and... leave[s] twenty dollars in the bank." This act of saving means that the $20 "broke out" of the circular flow. He emphasizes, "There's a leak in the pipe," and this money is no longer in his pocket to spend immediately. If he were to go to the grocery store, he would only have $80 because he "left it in the bank on the way home". Savings represent money households choose not to spend, diverting it to financial institutions instead of directly into the product market.
    
2. Taxes (to the Government Sector):
    
    From his $100 earnings, the instructor also has to pay taxes, estimating a "twenty percent taxes," which amounts to another "twenty dollars." This money "leaked out of the circular flow" and "went to the government," such as the Chilean government in his example. He points out that "all the red arrows on here [the model] leakages out of the circular flow." While he focuses on household taxes, he also briefly mentions that "firms are also charged taxes," which would similarly be a leakage from their revenues to the government.
    
3. Imports (to the Foreign Sector):
    
    Money also leaves the domestic circular flow when spent on goods or services produced outside the country. The instructor recounts wanting a new book and buying it from Amazon, noting that "Amazon is actually located... outside of Chile," in the United States. His $20 spent on the book "is it staying in Chile? No, it's leaking out of the circular flow of Chile and it's going there to the United States. It's gone. It's in the US now." He clarifies that "imports are leakages" because "the book comes here, but the money went to the United States and stayed there," emphasizing that in the circular flow of income, one must "track the money, money, money, money, money".
    

In total, from his $100, the instructor accounted for $20 in savings, $20 in taxes, and $20 for an imported book, meaning "$20, 40, 60 dollars that has leaked out of the circular flow model". These leakages represent money that is not immediately re-spent within the domestic economy on goods and services, potentially reducing the overall flow of income.
