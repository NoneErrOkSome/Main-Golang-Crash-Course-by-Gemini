Alright, let's dive into the **Circular Flow of Income Model**, as explained by the instructor, which is "a pretty complicated look at a macro economy" but essential for understanding how an economy works.

The instructor suggests we pretend we're "looking down at a country" – perhaps South Africa, Somalia, Thailand, the United States, or the United Kingdom – seeing "all this economic activity" like people buying, producers producing, and ships arriving and departing. The goal of this model is to "take that and put it into a model that's manageable for our brains".

This particular model, credited to Jason Walker, is described as "the most sophisticated circular flow model" you'll encounter, providing a foundational understanding for both micro and macroeconomics.

### The Basic Circular Flow: Households and Firms

The simplest version of the model begins with two main participants: **Households** and **Firms**. As the instructor says, "every economic story begins in a household" because "that's where we wake up every morning".

Let's follow the instructor's example:

1. **From Household to Firm (Factors of Production):** The instructor, representing a household, "gets up" and goes to his job as an ABC economics teacher in Santiago. He takes his "labor" – one of the "factors of production" (which also include land, capital, and entrepreneurship) – and provides it to his school (a firm).
2. **From Firm to Household (Income):** After a day of work, the school (firm) pays him $100. This payment for his labor is called "wages," which is his "income". This money flows from the firm back to the household.
3. **From Household to Firm (Expenditure):** The instructor then takes his earned $100 home. Feeling hungry, he gets back in his van and drives to a grocery store chain called Jumbo (a firm). There, he buys "the makings for his salad" – goods like tomatoes, feta cheese, olives, capers, olive oil, and vinegar. This spending is "expenditure," and that money flows from the household to the firm.
4. **From Firm to Household (Goods and Services):** In return for his money, the grocery store (firm) provides him with "output," which are the goods (salad makings in this case). This output flows from the firm back to the household. The money he spent becomes "revenues for that firm".

This continuous cycle, where money flows from households to firms for goods and services, and from firms back to households as income for factors of production, forms the basic "circular flow of money going around in economy".

### Leakages: Money Exiting the Flow (Red Arrows)

However, the real economy is more complex. Not all money circulates perfectly between households and firms. Some money "leaks out" of this immediate flow. The instructor calls these "leakages" – money that "comes out of the circular flow model".

There are three main types of leakages:

1. **Savings (to the Banking Sector):** When the instructor earns his $100, he doesn't spend it all. He "stops by the bank" and "leaves twenty dollars in the bank". This $20 "broke out" of the circular flow; it's a "leak" in the pipe, meaning he doesn't have it to spend on goods and services immediately.
2. **Taxes (to the Government Sector):** Another portion of his income goes to the government. From his $100, he pays "twenty percent taxes," so "twenty dollars again...leaked out of the circular flow" and "went to the government" (e.g., the Chilean government in his example). Firms are also charged taxes, creating another leakage from their revenues.
3. **Imports (to the Foreign Sector):** Money also leaks out when individuals or firms within the country buy goods or services from outside the country. The instructor wanted a new book and bought it from Amazon, noting that Amazon is located "outside of Chile" (in the United States). His $20 for the book "is it staying in Chile? No, it's leaking out of the circular flow of Chile and it's going there to the United States. It's gone". The instructor emphasizes that "imports are leakages" because "the money went to the United States and stayed there".

So, from his original $100, $20 went to the bank, $20 to the government, and $20 to the US, totaling $60 that "leaked out of the circular flow model".

### Injections: Money Entering the Flow (Green Arrows)

Fortunately, money also "gets injected back into the economy". These "injections" counteract the leakages, representing money flowing _into_ the circular flow from external sources.

There are three main types of injections:

1. **Investment (from the Banking Sector):** Banks don't just "keep" the money they receive as savings. They are "in business to sell money". They take those savings (like the instructor's $20, plus other people's savings) and "offer out loans to businesses". This lending by banks to businesses is considered an "injection into the circular flow model," putting that money "back in" so "now it's floating around".
2. **Government Spending (from the Government Sector):** The money the government collects from taxes isn't just held; it's spent to "produce public goods." The instructor gives examples like a new skate park, paying teachers, healthcare, militaries, streetlights, national parks, and airports. All this government spending is "injected back into the economy" in the form of these public goods and services. His "taxes are being used to help the public good".
3. **Exports (from the Foreign Sector):** Money enters the economy when goods or services are sold to other countries. The instructor provides an example of a Chilena living in New York City who wants to buy Chilean wine to "feel like she's at home". She buys a $20 bottle of Chilean wine with money earned in the US, and that money "goes right back into, you guessed it, the circular flow model of what country? Chile". The instructor stresses that "exports are injections" because "while the wine went to the United States, what came back? US dollars change in the pesos. And that was an injection into the Chilean economy".

The key takeaway is to "track the money, money, money, money, money" in the circular flow of income.

### Conclusion

The circular flow model, despite its inherent "flaws" due to assumptions, provides a "really cool" "aerial view" that makes a "really complex economy into a model". Understanding this macroeconomic concept from the beginning is vital because it shows "how a macro economy works," which then helps in understanding the "small" microeconomic activities. It helps you grasp "the big picture how money flows around" and realize that your everyday actions, like going to work or buying something at the store, are part of this large, interconnected diagram.
