The basic circular flow model simplifies the economy to focus on the fundamental interaction between two key sectors: **Households** and **Firms**.

As the instructor explains, "every economic story begins in a household" because "that's where we wake up every morning".

### Households

Households represent the groups of individuals in the economy and perform two crucial functions:

1. **Consumers of Goods and Services:** Households purchase the "output" produced by firms. For example, when the instructor, representing a household, goes to the grocery store chain Jumbo and buys "the makings for his salad" (tomatoes, feta cheese, olives, etc.), he is acting as a consumer, expending money on goods.
2. **Owners and Providers of Factors of Production:** Households own and supply the resources that firms need to produce goods and services. These resources are known as "factors of production," which include:
    - **Labor:** The human effort, skills, and knowledge used in production. The instructor provides his "labor" as an ABC economics teacher to his school.
    - **Land:** Natural resources used in production.
    - **Capital:** Manufactured resources used to produce other goods and services (e.g., machinery, buildings).
    - **Entrepreneurship:** The ability to organize and combine the other factors of production to create new businesses or products.

### Firms

Firms represent the "productive units in the economy that turn the factors of production into goods and services". This sector is1 "owned by private individuals".

- **Goods** are tangible products (e.g., the salad makings from Jumbo, cars, washing machines, ice cream).
- **Services** are intangible products (e.g., a haircut, insurance).

### The Basic Circular Flow of Money and Resources

The instructor illustrates this basic flow with his daily routine:

1. **Households supply Factors of Production to Firms:** The instructor (household) "takes my labor and I'm going to go over to my school" (firm). This flow represents the factors of production moving from households to firms.
2. **Firms pay Income to Households:** At the end of the day, the school (firm) hands the instructor (household) "$100. That's my pay for the day." This payment for labor is called "wages," which is "money earned by selling your labor" and represents income flowing from firms to households.
3. **Households make Expenditures on Goods and Services from Firms:** The instructor then takes his "money that I earned from my school... brought back to my household. Then I took it in my pocket and I went all the way to Jumbo... I left some money there". This spending is "expenditure," and it represents money flowing from households to firms.
4. **Firms provide Goods and Services to Households:** In exchange for the money, the grocery store (firm) provides "the output," which are the "goods, the salad makings". This represents goods and services flowing from firms back to households. The money received by the firm from the household's spending becomes "revenues for that firm".

This continuous cycle means that "my income flowed where into the income, the revenue of the firm and I went back home with goods and services." The instructor notes that if he spent all his money, he would then "have no money" and would need to "get back up in the morning. I got to work again, and then I go back home. And then I go to the store and on and on and on". This creates a "flow," as if it "were like a pipe with water flowing in it... the water flowing in the pipe is money, certain circular flow of income. It's a circular flow of money going around in economy".

This initial model, however, is a simplification and "ignores two important sectors of the economy: the government and international trade".
