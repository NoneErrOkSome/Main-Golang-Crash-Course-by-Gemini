Okay, let's break down the concepts of **positive economics** and **normative economics** using some real-world examples, keeping the instructor's insights in mind.

The instructor wants us to understand these two terms because as future economists, we'll need to know the difference and how to move between them. It’s about taking facts and using them to form informed opinions for policy.

### Positive Economics: What Is (The Facts)

A **positive economic statement** is one that can be proven to be right or wrong by looking at actual data and facts. It’s an analysis of "what is". Think of it as a statement that's objective and verifiable.

**Real-world examples:**

- **Unemployment Rates:** The statement, "The unemployment rate in my country is currently 6.5%" is a positive economic statement. We can check government statistics, labor force surveys, and other data to verify if that percentage is accurate.
    
- **Price of a Good:** "The average price of a gallon of gasoline in London last week was £1.50." This is a factual statement. You could look up gas prices from that time to confirm its accuracy.
- **Economic Growth:** "Last quarter, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Japan grew by 0.5%." This is a measurable fact from economic reports and can be verified.
- **Trade Balance:** "Vietnam had a trade surplus of $5 billion last year." This can be confirmed by looking at the country's international trade statistics.

### Normative Economics: What Ought to Be (The Opinions)

A **normative economic statement** is a matter of opinion or a value judgment. It cannot be conclusively proven to be right or wrong because it involves subjective beliefs about what _should_ or _ought_ to happen.

**Real-world examples:**

- **Government Policy on Unemployment:** Following our positive statement above, a normative statement would be, "The government _should_ implement new job training programs to reduce the unemployment rate." This is an opinion about what action _ought_ to be taken, and whether it's "right" or "wrong" depends on one's values or goals.
    
- **Minimum Wage:** "The national minimum wage _ought to be_ raised to $15 per hour to ensure a living wage for all workers." This is a judgment about what a fair wage is, which is subjective.
- **Environmental Regulation:** "Countries _should_ impose higher taxes on companies that pollute to protect the environment." This is a prescriptive statement based on a value judgment about environmental protection.
- **Healthcare Spending:** "More government funds _should be allocated_ to public healthcare services, even if it means higher taxes." This reflects an opinion on priorities for public spending.

### Why This Matters for an Economist:

The instructor highlights the crucial role you'll play as an economist: you take the **positive economic facts** (the "what is" – like the unemployment rate or the price of a good) and then use your economic knowledge and analysis to form a **normative economic opinion** (the "what ought to be" – what the government _should_ do about it). Politicians, for example, will look to economists for these informed judgments to help shape government policy. It's about taking raw data and turning it into actionable, evaluated advice.
