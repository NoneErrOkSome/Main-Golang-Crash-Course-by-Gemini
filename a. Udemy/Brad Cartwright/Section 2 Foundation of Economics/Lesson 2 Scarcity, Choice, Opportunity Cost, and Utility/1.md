### 🟠 **Part 1: Scarcity**

_“Scarcity is a very simple concept… You just have to, like, tune into them a little bit.”_

---

#### 📘 **Definition of Scarcity**

> **Scarcity** means that **there is not enough of something** to satisfy **everyone who wants it**.  
> Because of this, we **have to make decisions** about how those limited things are distributed.

#### 🧾 **Why Scarcity Implies Price**

> “If something costs money, that’s proof that it’s scarce.”

- Example: Water used to be a **free good**, but **fresh water** is now **sold in bottles**, so it’s now an **economic good**.
    
- The act of **putting a price on something** is a way of **rationing** it — of deciding **who gets it**.

#### 🧑‍🏫 **What Is Rationing in Economics?**

- **Rationing** = deciding **who gets how much** of a limited item.
    
- Example: If a teacher only has 10 papers for 20 students, the papers are **rationed** — maybe only some students get them, or they have to **share**.

#### 🌬️ **Example: Air vs. Water**

- Breathing air doesn’t prevent someone else from breathing → **not scarce**, hence a **free good**.
    
- Buying water means someone else can’t drink it for free → **scarce**, hence an **economic good**.

#### 🧠 **Key Insight**

> If it’s **scarce**, it will have a **price** and be called an **economic good**.  
> If it’s **not scarce**, it will be **free** and called a **free good**.
