### 🟣 **Part 3: Opportunity Cost**

_“Opportunity cost is the opportunity lost — the thing you couldn’t have because you chose something else.”_

---

#### 💡 **Definition of Opportunity Cost**

> **Opportunity cost** is the **value of the next best alternative** you give up when you make a decision.

It’s **not just about money** — it’s about **what you sacrifice**.

---

#### 🔁 **How It Connects to Scarcity and Choice**

- **Scarcity** forces you to **choose**
    
- **Choosing** one thing means **giving up** another
    
- The thing you gave up = **opportunity cost**

#### 🛒 **Real-Life Examples**

1. **Buying This Economics Course**
    
    - You paid $50.
        
    - You could’ve used that $50 to buy new shoes.
        
    - **Opportunity Cost = The shoes**
        
2. **Choosing to Work Overtime**
    
    - You earn extra money 💵
        
    - But you miss your friend’s birthday 🎉
        
    - **Opportunity Cost = The time with your friend**
        
3. **Buying an Empanada in South America**
    
    - Empanada = 😋
        
    - You could’ve had a chicken wrap
        
    - **Opportunity Cost = Chicken wrap**

#### 🧮 **Quick Formula (Conceptual)**

> **Opportunity Cost** = **Next Best Alternative You Sacrifice**

---

#### 🚫 **When There’s No Opportunity Cost**

If a good is **free** and **not scarce**, you’re not giving anything up to consume it.

Example:

- Breathing air ≠ opportunity cost
    
- There’s no limit → nothing is sacrificed → **no trade-off**
    

---

#### 🧠 **Why It Matters in Economics**

Understanding opportunity cost helps individuals, businesses, and governments make **better decisions**.

Instead of asking:

> “Can I afford it?”

Ask:

> “What am I **giving up** by choosing this?”

---

#### 🔄 **Summary Cycle**

```
Scarcity → Choice → Opportunity Cost
```

You're constantly making decisions, and every decision comes with a **hidden cost** — the **next best thing you didn’t choose**.

—

Next, we’ll bring in **how people measure the value of their choices** through **happiness or satisfaction**.
