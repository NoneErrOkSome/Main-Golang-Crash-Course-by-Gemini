### 🔵 **Part 2: Choice**

_“Since people do not have infinite incomes, they make choices…”_

#### 🧩 **What Is Choice in Economics?**

> **Choice** is the decision we make when we face **limited resources** and **multiple alternatives**.

You can't have everything — so you must **choose** what to get and what to give up.

---

#### 🔗 **How Scarcity Leads to Choice**

|Scarcity|→|Limited Resources|
|---|---|---|
|Limited Resources|→|Must Choose|
|Must Choose|→|Trade-Offs|

- You **can’t** buy or do **everything** because:
    
    - **Money** is limited
        
    - **Time** is limited
        
    - **Resources** are limited
        

So, **every time** you pick one thing, you’re also **not picking something else**.

#### 🧍 **Real-Life Example**

You have **$100**.

| Option A: Buy this Microeconomics Course |  
| Option B: Buy a new pair of shoes |

If you **choose** the course, you **give up** the shoes.  
If you choose the shoes, you give up the course.

➡️ **That’s choice.**

#### 🧠 **Why Choice Is Essential in Economics**

Economics is the study of **how people make choices** when **resources are scarce**.  
Every economic decision — buying, saving, producing, hiring — involves **choosing between alternatives**.
