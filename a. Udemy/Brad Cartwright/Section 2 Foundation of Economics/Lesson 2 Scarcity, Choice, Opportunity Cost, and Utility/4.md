Great! Let’s break down:

### 🟢 **Part 4: Utility**

_“Utility is a measure of happiness… the pleasure you get when you consume a product.”_

---

#### 🎯 **What Is Utility?**

> **Utility** is the **satisfaction**, **usefulness**, or **pleasure** a person gets from consuming a good or service.

In economics, **utility = happiness** from your decision.

#### 🍦 **Real-Life Example: The Ice Cream Cone**

Imagine it’s a **hot summer day** ☀️

- You buy an **ice cream cone** for $1.50
    
- You take a lick — **pure joy** 😋
    
- That **feeling of happiness** = **utility**
    

You loved it so much, you get a second one…

- Still good, but **not as exciting**
    
- That’s **less marginal utility**
    

By the **third or fourth**, you're feeling sick 🤢

#### 📏 **Two Types of Utility**

|Type|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Total Utility**|The **total satisfaction** you get from all units consumed (1st + 2nd + …)|
|**Marginal Utility**|The **extra satisfaction** from **one more** unit consumed|

---

#### ➖ **Diminishing Marginal Utility**

> The **more** you consume, the **less extra happiness** you get from each additional unit.

|Ice Cream Cone #|Total Utility|Marginal Utility (Extra Happiness)|
|---|---|---|
|1st|10|+10|
|2nd|17|+7|
|3rd|21|+4|
|4th|22|+1|
|5th|21|**-1** (now you're sick 🤮)|

#### 🧠 **Why Utility Matters**

Utility helps explain **why we make choices**:

- You buy things that **give you the most happiness per dollar**
    
- You stop buying when **marginal utility falls below the cost**
    
- Businesses and governments use this concept to **predict behavior**

#### 🔄 **Where We Are So Far**

```
Scarcity → forces Choice → creates Opportunity Cost → measured by Utility
```

This forms the **foundation** of how we study economic behavior.
