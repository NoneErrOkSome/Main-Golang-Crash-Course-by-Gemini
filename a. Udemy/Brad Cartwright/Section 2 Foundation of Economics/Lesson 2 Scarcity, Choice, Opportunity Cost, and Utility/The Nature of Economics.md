Based on the video transcript, here is a summary of the foundational principles of economics.

### The Nature of Economics

Economics is described as both a philosophy and a social science1. It is the study of human behavior, focusing on how people act when buying and producing and how they interact with one another2. A key concept is that while an individual's behavior may not always be predictable, the behavior of large groups is, which makes it possible to study3. The speaker identifies their main source for the course material as an IB economics textbook by Joscelyn Blink and Ian Dordogne4.

### Origins and Key Figures

The origins of Western microeconomics are attributed to Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher5. His 1776 book,

_The Wealth of Nations_, is considered the beginning of the formal study of the subject6. Smith's work was based on observing human behavior and collecting data during the industrial revolution in England7.

### The Fundamental Economic Problem

The central issue in economics is the conflict between the planet's finite resources and people's infinite wants and needs8. This imbalance leads to scarcity, which means that people cannot have everything they want, and therefore, resources must be rationed in some way9. From this problem, economics is defined as "the study of how scarce resources are allocated to fulfill... infinite wants and needs"10.

### Core Economic Terms

The speaker stresses that learning economics is like learning a new language and that students must know the precise definitions of key terms11. Five main concepts are introduced:

- **Goods**: Physical, tangible objects that can be touched, like a table12.
    
- **Services**: Intangible things that cannot be touched, such as insurance, haircuts, or education13.
    
- **Wants**: Things people would like to have but are not necessary for immediate survival, such as televisions or iPhones14.
    
- **Needs**: Items that are necessary for survival, including food, clothing, and shelter15.
    
- **Resources**: Goods that are used to produce other goods16. These are also referred to as the "factors of production," which include land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship17.
