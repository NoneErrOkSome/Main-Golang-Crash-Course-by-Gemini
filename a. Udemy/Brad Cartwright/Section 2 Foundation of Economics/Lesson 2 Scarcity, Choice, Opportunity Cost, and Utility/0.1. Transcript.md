Alright, now that we've got that basic understanding of what economics is in general, let's look at four really key terms that _never_ go away, okay? We actually touched on these in the overall intro. And those things are **scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and this notion of happiness, which economists call it utility.**

Say 'em with me: scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, utility. Scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, utility. Make sure you are _really_ comfortable with these ideas, alright?

They build on one another, by the way. And actually, as we're gonna see, they build on one another, and then it's pretty cool, we get to our first diagram in economics, the Production Possibilities Curve, which is an expression of all three of these things... four of these. Okay, so here we go:

**Scarcity**. Scarcity is a very simple concept. You're gonna get this. Like many things in economics, they're not that complicated, you just have to, like, tune into them a little bit. Okay, scarcity simply means that there's **not enough of something to satisfy everyone who wants it.** And therefore – here's the economic point of it – **we have to pay for it!** You got that? Things are scarce, and therefore they have a price. Any item that costs something is scarce.

Once you pay a price for it, that item becomes – key term! – an **economic good**. An economic good is defined as **any good or service that has a price and is thus being rationed.** Rationing is just a fancy way of being handed out. Like a teacher handing out papers – they're rationing them because they only have so many. If there are 20 students and only 10 papers, only 10 students get them, or maybe you have to share. That's what ration means.

Okay, so, if things are _not_ scarce, then that good would be a **free good**. You could have as much as you want without paying for it. Think about this: pretty much everything in this world is scarce, okay? With a few exceptions. Therefore, pretty much everything you buy is an economic good. Except for things like air.

Let's talk about a free good. It's something I can consume, and it doesn't take anything away from you. It's not scarce. A good example is air. If I breathe, you can still breathe. I'm not taking something away from you. There seems to be an infinite amount of air. Now, with climate change and pollution, especially in big cities, maybe someday – jeez – we're gonna have to buy our air. Wouldn't that be something? But fresh water? Used to seem infinite, but now we buy it, or we have to buy it.

But that's the notion of scarcity. **Scarcity creates an economic good** because there's not enough, and something has to decide who gets it. Basically, what decides who gets it is the people that can buy it. If they can afford the price, that's how it's decided. Okay? So, that's scarcity.

Secondly, this is easy: **Choice**. This actually translates really well into regular life. You didn't _have_ to buy this bundle, right? You could have bought something else. You made a choice. Understanding that people make choices is key to understanding and studying economics. Since people don't have infinite incomes, they make choices whenever they purchase goods and services. They have to decide how to allocate their limited financial resources. So they always need to choose between alternatives.

And when they do that – when they spend their money on one thing – the impact is they don't have that money in their pocket to buy the _other_ thing. And that other thing becomes the **Opportunity Cost**.

Opportunity cost is the opportunity lost, the opportunity you _can't_ have because you bought this. Think about the money you paid for this microeconomics course. Boom! Money went to the course. Now, money from your income can't be spent on something else. The opportunity cost of purchasing this course is that you can't buy something else. It's the _other_ thing. Maybe you bought this course, and therefore you can't buy a new pair of shoes. The opportunity cost of this course _are_ the shoes.

Okay, so opportunity cost is created by scarcity and choice. You have scarcity, which forces choice, and then you have opportunity cost.

Opportunity cost, as I said even before I got to the slide, is simply **what you give up in order to buy something else.** Simple example from South America: If you buy an empanada instead of a chicken wrap, the opportunity cost of the empanada is the chicken wrap. Just like buying the bundle, the opportunity cost of the bundle is the new pair of shoes.

Other idea: if a good or service has an opportunity cost, it must be relatively scarce, so it will have a price to be classified as an economic good. That makes sense, right? Free goods like air do not have an opportunity cost because they're not scarce. So they have no price, and so they're free. Makes sense. Alright, excellent!

So, scarcity, choice, opportunity cost – that's a big circle that keeps going around and around and around. Huge conceptual, intellectual, cognitive basis of economics.

And then the fourth thing is your **happiness, Utility**. Utility, utility, utility. I'll show you this slide in a second, but you understand this intuitively. Picture a hot summer day. You want an ice cream cone. It costs a dollar fifty. You buy it, take the first lick, and holy moly, are you happy! Do you feel pleasure? Of course!

So, **utility is a measure of usefulness or pleasure a consumer receives when they consume a product.** It's your happiness from that ice cream cone.

And utility is actually broken down into two subsections: **Total Utility** and **Marginal Utility**. This notion of "marginal" – you have got to get this in your head right now. It _always_ means the same thing. Kids get confused on this term, marginal, and you shouldn't! Marginal just means it's the **difference between having one and then two**. This difference from one to two. Or the difference between having one _more_, which is the difference between two and three, or three and four. There's a marginal difference between one and two, then a _new_ marginal difference between two and three, then a _new_ marginal difference between three and four.

And guess what happens if you add up all of the marginal utility? You get total utility!

Okay, back to the ice cream. I buy the first cone, and check it out, man, I am happy! But then I think, "You know what? I have another dollar fifty. It's still hot. I want another ice cream cone." I buy the second one. You _all_ know the second ice cream cone does not taste as good as the first one! You are not equally happy. In fact, your happiness diminishes with the purchase of the second cone – it **marginally diminishes**.

Then, if for some crazy reason you get a third cone? Hoo! You are no longer happy, you're feeling sick. And if you buy the fourth, you're gonna never want ice cream in your life!

So, Total Utility is all of that happiness combined. But Marginal Utility? What happened to the utility from that _extra_ cone? The marginal utility from the fourth cone was way less than the first. So, **marginal utility tends to diminish the more we buy of the same product.**

Take a look at the slide – I just said this stuff.

- Total Utility: Total satisfaction gained from consuming a certain quantity of a product (like four ice cream cones, or maybe just the total from one if that's all you bought).
- Marginal Utility: The _actual utility gained from consuming one more unit of a product_.
- And it's believed, in most cases, as I just showed you with the ice cream (or you understand intuitively from buying too many), that the marginal utility gained from extra units of a product **falls as consumption increases.** If you need a new pair of running shoes, BAM, you love those! But if you get two, or three, or four? You don't love them all equally.

So, guess what? You understand intuitively marginal utility. Okay?

We're rollin now, rollin, rollin, rollin! Scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and utility – forming the philosophical background in your brain, the meaning for your entire study of economics. Alright, on to the next one!
