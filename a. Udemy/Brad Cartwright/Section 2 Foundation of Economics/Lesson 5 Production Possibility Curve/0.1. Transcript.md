Alright, folks, this is the moment you've been waiting for! This is when you are going to draw your first diagram in microeconomics. Now, don't let that simplicity in drawing make you think this diagram isn't important, or that it's not useful. That's better! Because the **Production Possibilities Curve** – or the **Production Possibilities Frontier**, same thing, don't get discouraged if you hear it called the frontier – this is _really, really fundamental_ to your understanding.

Why? Because it takes those four main concepts we hammered on in the beginning – scarcity, choice, opportunity cost – and also what we just covered, the factors of production, and it puts them together. It's our first chance to take something really abstract – scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, factors of production – and put them into something concrete, sequential, which is a diagram.

And let me take a second to tell you this: Economics asks your brain to do _a lot_. If you're studying history, you swim in one side of your mind – it's abstract, human stories, emotions, the beauty of life. Math? You swim in the other side – concrete, sequential, rational thought. Economics, my goodness, you have to take human stories and make them _flat_. Dude, that's hard! Because now you're working both the left and right sides of your brain. And especially if you're in the IB program, or any university level, you have to take that abstract stuff, put it on a flat diagram, and then float back over to the abstract part of your mind and write an essay. It's hard!

Therefore, there are multiple steps. It's going to take you one, two – I always tell my students here in Santiago, it takes _three_ trips through your mind for economics to really come clean. But the thing is, once it goes clean, **boom!** You got it. And it never really goes away. That's exciting as a teacher when you see that "ohh!" because they got it, clarity came, and they never forget.

So, let's take the production possibilities curve, because we're gonna show how that abstract stuff – scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and the factors of production – work in a diagram.

First, the fundamental definition. The **Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)** or **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)** shows the **maximum combinations of goods and services that can be produced by an economy in a given time period, if all resources in the economy are being used fully and efficiently, and the state of technology is fixed.**

Okay, you got that? That's the classic econ definition with all those necessary assumptions. Let's break it down. It shows the _maximum possible_ combinations, like a snapshot, not a video. You can't study economics like a video; there are too many variables. You have to freeze it in time – a _given period of time_, where _all resources_ (our factors of production: land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) are being used _fully and efficiently_, and the _technology_ isn't changing. Only then can you draw this diagram.

So, how do we construct it?

First, you have two goods. One on the vertical axis, one on the horizontal. Can be anything. The old-school macro example is guns and butter (military vs. civilian goods for a country). But for this, you can use any two products, assuming your economy only produces those two. Let's use iPhones on the vertical axis and mountain bikes on the horizontal axis for our economy, our country.

Now, let's make some simple assumptions, like the instructor did. Assume there are only 20 people in our country. And, fantasy land version one: assume all 20 people are _equally good_ at making iPhones _and_ mountain bikes. And let's say, just make believe, it takes one day for one person to make either one iPhone or one mountain bike.

- If all 20 people make iPhones: How many iPhones? 20. How many mountain bikes? 0. Plot that point: (0 Mountain Bikes, 20 iPhones).
- If all 20 people make mountain bikes: How many mountain bikes? 20. How many iPhones? 0. Plot that point: (20 Mountain Bikes, 0 iPhones).

Now, if they're equally good, you can imagine a straight line connecting those points. What if we want 1 mountain bike? Well, one person makes a bike, the other 19 make iPhones. We get 1 mountain bike and 19 iPhones. Plot (1, 19). What about 10 and 10? Ten people make bikes, ten make iPhones. Plot (10, 10). What about 19 mountain bikes and 1 iPhone? (19, 1).

If you plot these, you get a straight line from 20 iPhones down to 20 mountain bikes. What does this straight line show us? **Opportunity cost!** You see, because resources (our 20 people/labor) are **scarce**, and we have to make a **choice** about how to allocate them, every time we choose to make one more mountain bike, we give up the opportunity to make one iPhone (in this fantasy straight-line world). The opportunity cost of one mountain bike is one iPhone, and vice-versa. We can make any combination along that line, but we _can't_ operate _outside_ it – like making 11 iPhones and 11 mountain bikes. That's 22 total goods! We only have 20 people! So, points outside the curve are **impossible** with our current resources and technology.

Now, that straight line is fantasy land. Why? Because in the real world, people aren't equally good at making iPhones and mountain bikes! Let's face it, the skills are different. In reality, we have specialization – experts in mountain bikes and experts in iPhones.

So, imagine we have 10 iPhone experts and 10 mountain bike experts. If we have the 10 iPhone experts make iPhones and the 10 mountain bike experts make mountain bikes, maybe we can indeed get 10 iPhones and 10 mountain bikes – a point right in the middle (10, 10). But what happens if we want more iPhones? We have to take a mountain bike expert and try to make them make iPhones. Guess what? They're not as good! They can't make a whole iPhone in a day like the expert. Maybe they can only make half an iPhone. So, as we shift _more and more_ resources (people) from where they're specialized (bikes) to where they're not (iPhones), we get _fewer and fewer_ additional iPhones for each mountain bike we give up compared to the straight-line fantasy. The opportunity cost of getting more iPhones _increases_ as we make more of them because we're pulling less and less suitable labor onto the task.

This is why the Production Possibilities Curve is actually **curved inward** towards the origin. At the ends, where you're trying to make almost all of one product, you're forcing highly specialized resources into a task they aren't good at. The iPhone experts trying to make bikes, or the bike experts trying to make iPhones. As you go closer to making everybody make just one product, you don't end up with 20 of that product because of specialization. The curve "tucks in" at the sides.

The PPC/PPF shows the _maximum potential_ output if everything is perfect. But, as the instructor pointed out, that's fantasy too. In reality, it's impossible for a country to operate _on_ its Production Possibilities Curve. Why? Because factors of production are never _fully and efficiently_ employed all the time. Someone is always sick, a machine breaks down, a factory isn't at full capacity, someone isn't trying their hardest. So, real economies always operate _inside_ the curve (like points X or Y on a diagram). Operating on the curve (like point Z) is impossible in reality.

What about operating _outside_ the curve, like point A? Also impossible _with our current resources and technology_. The _only_ way to operate beyond the current curve is if the entire **Production Possibilities Curve shifts outwards**.

How does that outward shift happen? Only by improving the **quantity or quality of the factors of production: Land, Labor, Capital, and Entrepreneurship!** This is how an economy experiences economic growth – increasing its _potential_ to produce more goods and services.

- **Land:** You could increase the _quantity_ by, say, taking over a neighbor's land (like the Argentina example). Or improve the _quality_ of existing land through better farming techniques.
- **Labor:** Increase the _quantity_ with more people (like immigration, which the instructor highlights is good for an economy's potential). Improve the _quality_ through better education and healthcare, making the workforce more skilled and productive (human capital).
- **Capital:** Increase the _quantity_ by building more factories or acquiring more machinery. Improve the _quality_ by investing in better technology or building better infrastructure like roads, ports, and railways (as seen in the comparison between Chile's roads and Nicaragua's port). Better infrastructure reduces transportation costs and increases efficiency.
- **Entrepreneurship:** Improve the _quality_ through more innovation, better management practices, and creating an environment where new businesses can thrive.

So, an outward shift of the entire PPC/PPF represents this economic growth, allowing the economy to potentially produce combinations of goods and services that were previously impossible.

Alright, that one might feel a little overwhelming with the layering, but it's important to get these ideas in your mind now. They _will_ come back later. And remember, you can do this! Take your time, work through these diagrams, make sure you can draw them, define the terms, and know that once you get it, man, you never forget!

There you go. The Production Possibilities Curve. Onward to the next!
