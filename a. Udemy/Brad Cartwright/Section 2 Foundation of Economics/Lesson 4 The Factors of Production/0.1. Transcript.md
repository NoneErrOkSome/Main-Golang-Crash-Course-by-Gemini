Alright, now that we've got scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and utility in our vocabulary, we're gonna look a little more detail at what it is exactly the producers would _need_ in order to produce anything, right? We just looked at the basic economic problem – What, How, For Whom – but that doesn't necessarily tell us what you actually _need_.

Very much like the basic economic problem, the **factors of production** are the things needed to make a car, the things needed to make a shirt, the things needed to make a microeconomics online course.1 Okay? And actually – this is so cool, I think – it doesn't matter what we're talking about! We could be talking about the largest mining company on the planet, or just some dude who wants to sell hot dogs on the corner. Same process. Every producer needs these four things right here.

Factors of production are the four resources that allow an economy to produce its output.2 They are:

Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship.

Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship. Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship.

Do you need to know them in that order? No, doesn't matter. But I'm telling you what, I remember 'em in that order. Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship. I know the slide also says "Management" – you can say management, entrepreneurship, management, interchangeable. I like saying entrepreneurship. Say whichever one you want.

Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship. But be careful! Fair warning in economics – whether it's micro, macro, international, development economics – sometimes you think you know the definition of a word because it's used in real life. But you are getting tricked! Because in economics, oftentimes the words have either a broader meaning or a completely different meaning than in regular life. A good example is land and capital in this topic of factors of production.

Let's look at each one specifically:

**Land:** This is one you need to open your mind on. It needs more than just the earth. Land is defined as **all raw and cultivated natural resources.** Did you get that? It includes _everything_ that grows on the land or is found under it. What grows on land? Trees, cotton, corn, coffee, cocoa – you name it. Anything grown on land. It also includes all natural resources like oil, copper, iron ore, coal – that's all considered land. It also – and this will throw you – includes everything found in or under the **sea**. So the ocean is considered land! What does that mean? Salmon farmers in Chile, farming in the ocean – that's considered land. Fish are natural resources, very much like coffee beans, considered under the category of land. It includes our basic raw materials – gold, coal, oil, natural gas, diamonds, everything that comes from the earth. And things like wheat, rice, apples, corn, oranges (or "porta potty" here in Chile for avocado!). Anything grown. Excellent. That's land.

**Labor:** This one's easy. It's **you**. If you go cut someone's grass, or get a job, you are labor. I'm an economics teacher here, and guess what? I am that school's labor. It refers to the **human resources used in the production of goods and services.**3 As I make these videos, I'm my own labor! Even if you have your own business, you are your own labor. You can _never_ find a situation where something is produced without labor. Labor is the human work, both physical and intellectual, that contributes to production. It's the human factor. We often think of labor as someone picking strawberries – yes, physical labor. But the person who planned the field layout, making sure irrigation flows correctly based on physics – that's not physical, that's intellectual labor. I'm a teacher; I sit at a table and talk. That's not physical labor, but it _is_ intellectual labor. Labor includes both the intellectual and physical sides of work.4

**Capital:** Land, Labor, Capital. Land, Labor, Capital. Land, Labor, Capital. I always say them in that order so you don't forget, because this stuff is with you always. These four factors _never_ go away in economics. Capital refers to the **tools and technologies that are used to produce the goods and services we desire.**5 Good definition, write that down. **Physical capital** is the stock of manufactured resources like factories, machinery, roads, and tools used in the economy.6 If you imagine a huge mining operation – factories, machines, roads, tools – everything involved is considered capital. It's _not_ just the money! Students think capital is money because it means that in some contexts, but here, capital is all the things a business could sell if everything went bad and still have money – like my setup here, the iPad, the camera. That's capital needed for these courses. For a school, capital is the buildings, the infrastructure. **Human capital** is the value of the workforce, affected by investment in education and healthcare.7 Businesses pay for training because an educated workforce is more valuable. Lastly, capital is also **infrastructure** – large-scale public systems like roads, railways, schools, hospitals, ports, airports, electricity plants.8 Like in Chile, the roads are fantastic capital investment! Goods and services move faster, costing less. In Nicaragua, I saw the opposite – no deep sea port meant ships couldn't offload directly, costing more to transport goods overland. Capital is crucial.

**Entrepreneurship:** Pretty straightforward. Refers to the **innovation and creativity applied in the production of goods and services.** Also known as management. You need someone to organize the factors of production – land, labor, capital – to produce goods and services. They use their own money or investor money to buy those factors, produce, and hopefully make a profit. Someone with a good idea invests their money, opens a restaurant, maybe it becomes popular, they make a living, maybe they get investors for franchises. That's entrepreneurship.

So there they are, the factors of production. Fundamentally important stuff that's never going to go away as long as you study economics, because producers are always there. Remember consumers and producers? The four factors a producer needs are Land, Labor, Capital, and Entrepreneurship.9

Alright, cool. Here we go in the foundations of microeconomics and onto the next video!
