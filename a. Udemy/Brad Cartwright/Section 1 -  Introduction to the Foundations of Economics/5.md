### 📒 **Part 5 – Unit 4: Government Intervention**

---

In this unit, you’ll learn how **governments act like "parents"** in the economy — stepping in when they believe the market isn’t working properly or fairly.

Let’s explore the key ideas:

---

## 🏛️ 1. **The Government as the "Parent" of the Economy**

- Imagine the economy is a **household**, and the **government is the parent**.
    
- Just like parents:
    
    - Governments may **let kids (markets) figure things out** on their own.
        
    - But they also **intervene** to protect, correct, or guide behavior — even if the kids don’t always notice.
        

📌 Example:

> The instructor lives in Santiago, Chile — and even if he doesn’t feel it daily, the Chilean government is constantly influencing the economy he lives in.

---

## 🎯 2. **Why Governments Intervene in Markets**

Even though economists often **start with the assumption** that **free markets work best**, governments still step in when needed.

### ✋ 3 Main Tools of Intervention:

---

### 📍 A. **Taxes**

- Governments **raise the price** of goods.
    
- Often used to discourage consumption (e.g., **cigarettes**, **alcohol**).
    
- Or to raise revenue for public services.
    

---

### 🪙 B. **Subsidies**

- Governments **give money to producers** to help lower costs and encourage more production.
    
- Often applied to **important industries** like:
    
    - **Green energy**
        
    - **Electric vehicles**
        
    - **Education**
        

➡️ The goal is to **make these goods cheaper and more available**.

---

### 🧾 C. **Price Controls**

Governments may set:

- **Price ceilings**: maximum prices to protect consumers  
    (e.g., rent control)
    
- **Price floors**: minimum prices to protect producers  
    (e.g., minimum wage)
    

These **override** what would have happened in a **pure market**, to try and **protect certain groups**.

---

## 🗳️ 3. **Politics and Economics Are Connected**

- Economics gives **birth** to politics — because **citizens want to decide how involved the government should be**.
    

📌 Think of this like a **teenager and their parents**:

- As people grow (get richer, older, more independent), they **want different levels of government involvement** — just like teens want different levels of parental control.
    

### 🗳️ In a democracy:

- You can **vote** to change the level of government involvement.
    
- Your economic situation often shapes **your political views**.

## 🔁 Recap:

|Government Action|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Tax**|Discourage use or raise revenue|Cigarettes, sugar tax|
|**Subsidy**|Encourage production, lower prices|Solar energy, EV cars|
|**Price Control**|Protect consumers/producers from market risks|Rent control, minimum wage|

---

## 🧠 Why This Unit Matters:

> “Even when you don’t see it, the government is **always influencing the economy** — sometimes subtly, sometimes directly.”

This unit builds a bridge between **pure economic models** and **real-world policy**.
