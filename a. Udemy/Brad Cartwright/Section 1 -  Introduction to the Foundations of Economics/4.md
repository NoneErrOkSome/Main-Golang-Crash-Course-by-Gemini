### 📕 **Part 4 – Unit 3: Elasticities**

---

This is where microeconomics gets **really interesting** — you learn how **responsive people are** to changes in economic forces like price or income.

Let’s break it down:

---

## 🧵 1. **What Does Elasticity Mean?**

### 📖 Definition:

> Elasticity is a measure of **responsiveness** — how much **quantity demanded** or **quantity supplied** changes when an economic factor changes.

---

### 🎯 Analogy:

Think of a **rubber band**:

- **Elastic**: stretches easily → **big response** to a force.
    
- **Inelastic**: barely stretches → **small or no response**.
    

In economics:

- Big change in buying behavior = **elastic**
    
- Little or no change in behavior = **inelastic**
    

---

## 💸 2. **Forces That Affect Demand Elasticity**

These are the **main "forces"** that stretch or restrict your decision to buy:

---

### 🔻 A. **Price**

- **Most common factor.**
    
- If the price goes up:
    
    - Do people still buy it? (Inelastic)
        
    - Or stop buying it? (Elastic)
        

#### 📌 Example:

- You love a t-shirt → but if the price doubles, you might say no thanks.
    
- You need insulin → even if price rises, you still buy it.
    

---

### 💰 B. **Income**

- Your **purchasing power** affects how you respond to prices.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- If you’re rich, an $80,000 Mercedes is affordable.
    
- If you’re earning $40,000/year, that car is way out of reach.
    

➡️ **Higher income = more likely to buy expensive goods**

---

### 👟 C. **Price of Other Goods**

- When **two goods compete**, a price drop in one affects the other.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- Nike vs Adidas shoes.
    
- If Nike goes on sale → you’ll probably buy those instead of Adidas.
    

➡️ These are **substitute goods** — change in one affects demand for the other.

---

## 🏭 3. **Elasticity of Supply**

Producers are also affected by **price** — just like consumers.

- If prices go **up** and profits look good → producers **supply more**.
    
- If prices fall → they may **supply less** or switch products.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- If the **World Cup** is coming and you make soccer balls:
    
    - You produce more ahead of time (expecting higher demand and price).
        
- After the event, you switch to basketballs for NBA season.

## 📌 Summary of Elasticities:

|Force|Affects|Elastic or Inelastic? (Depends on...)|
|---|---|---|
|Price|Demand & Supply|Necessity vs luxury, availability of substitutes|
|Income|Demand|Level of income, type of product|
|Price of other goods|Demand|Substitute or complementary product|
|Price (again)|Supply|Profit potential, time to react, flexibility in production|

---

## 🧠 Why This Unit Is Powerful:

Most students say:

> “Wow — I didn’t even realize I was reacting to all these things!”

Elasticities explain **why people buy or don’t buy**, and **why producers change behavior**, all in response to simple economic pressures.
