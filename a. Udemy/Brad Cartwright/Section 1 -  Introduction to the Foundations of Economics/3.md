### 📙 **Part 3 – Unit 2: Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium**

---

This is one of the most **recognizable topics** in microeconomics. Most people have some intuition about it — **you live this every day** when you buy and sell things.

Let’s break it into three parts:

---

## 🛒 1. **Demand**

### 🧍 Who?

- **Consumers** — that means **you and me**.
    

### 📖 Definition:

> Demand is what consumers are **willing and able** to buy at every price point.

- **Willing**: You **want** the product.
    
- **Able**: You **have the money** to buy it.
    

✅ Both are required for demand to exist.

---

### 📌 Example:

If a ring is priced at $20:

- If you want it (willing), but only have $10 (not able), then **no demand**.
    
- If you can afford it but don’t want it, **still no demand**.
    

Only when you **want it and can pay for it** do you count as part of demand.

## 🏭 2. **Supply**

### 🧑‍🔧 Who?

- **Producers** — people who make or sell goods/services.
    

### 📖 Definition:

> Supply is what producers are **willing and able** to produce at every price point.

- **Willing**: They think it’s worth selling at that price.
    
- **Able**: They have the tools/resources to produce it.
    

---

### 📌 Example:

A jeweler sees you looking at a ring:

- They think: “I could probably sell this for $10.”
    
- That is **their willingness and ability to supply** the ring.
    

---

## ⚖️ 3. **Market Equilibrium**

### 📖 Definition:

> The point where **demand and supply meet**.

This is where:

- The consumer’s **willingness and ability to buy**
    
- Meets the producer’s **willingness and ability to sell**
    

And they **agree on a price**.

---

### 🤝 Real-life example:

You’re at a market:

- You see a silver ring.
    
- You think: “I’ll pay $20.”
    
- The seller says: “I want $10.”
    
- You offer $10 → seller counters with $15 → you **shake hands**.
    

✅ That handshake = **market equilibrium price**  
✔️ Both sides are happy.  
✔️ Deal is made.

---

### 🔁 Why It’s Cool:

You do this **every day**, often without realizing it:

- Bargaining at markets
    
- Deciding to buy something based on how much you value it vs how much it costs
    

Economics turns this into **predictable models** using graphs and theory.
