#### 🧱 **Foundational Economic Concepts**

This unit lays the **core building blocks** for all of economics — not just micro, but macro, international, and development economics as well.

You’ll encounter these ideas throughout the course and even in real-life thinking.

### 🟠 1. **Scarcity**

- **Definition:** There is **not an infinite amount of anything**.
    
- **Key point:** Scarcity means **limited resources** — we can’t have everything we want.
    
- ❗Because of scarcity, we have to **make choices**.

### 🟡 2. **Choice**

- Since we **can’t have it all**, we have to **choose** between alternatives.
    
- Example: Apple vs Orange — choosing one means you can’t have the other.

### 🔵 3. **Opportunity Cost**

- **Definition:** The **value of the next best alternative** that you give up when you make a choice.
    
- Example:
    
    - Buy an iPhone → Can’t go on vacation.
        
    - The **vacation** is your opportunity cost.
        
- Applies to **every decision**.

### 🟣 4. **Utility**

- **Definition:** A measure of **satisfaction** or **happiness**.
    
- Think of utility as:
    
    - The **pleasure** you get from buying something.
        
    - The **usefulness** of a product or service.
        
- Example: The excitement from a **new phone**, the comfort from **a good meal**.

### 🧩 5. **The Basic Economic Problem**

- Every producer must answer **three essential questions** before making something:
    
    1. **What** should I produce?
        
    2. **How** should I produce it?
        
    3. **For whom** am I producing?
        

✅ This applies to:

- Big businesses (like Ford Motor Company)
    
- Small setups (like a **lemonade stand**)
    

It’s the **starting point for decision-making** in any economy.

### ⚙️ 6. **Factors of Production**

These are the **resources** used to produce goods and services:

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|**Land**|Natural resources like land, water, minerals|
|**Labor**|Human effort — physical or mental|
|**Capital**|Tools, machines, buildings used in production|
|**Entrepreneurship / Management**|The person or idea that organizes the others|

You **need all four** to create any product.

### 💡 Learning Tip:

Don’t try to memorize everything in your first pass.

> The instructor says:  
> _“It takes three trips through your brain before this stuff makes total sense.”_

Just absorb the **concepts** for now — definitions and diagrams will come later.
