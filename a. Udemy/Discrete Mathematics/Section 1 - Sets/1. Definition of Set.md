1. **Inline Math Format**: Use single dollar signs `$...$` to encapsulate inline mathematical expressions. This ensures that the expression is seamlessly integrated within a line of text. For example, to display an equation like \(E = mc^2\) within a sentence, format it as `$E = mc^2$`.

2. **Block Math Format**: Use double dollar signs `$$...$$` to encapsulate mathematical expressions that should appear on a new line or as standalone blocks. This is useful for larger equations that require emphasis or more space. For instance, to display a standalone equation:
   $$
   E = mc^2
   $$

3. **Avoid Backslashes for Delimiting Math Expressions**: Do not use backslashes such as `\(...\)` or `\[...\]` for opening and closing math expressions. Stick to using dollar signs as specified above.

**Definition of Set**

A set is defined as a collection of things or objects, which are referred to as the elements of the set. For example, if you have a collection of books in a library, or symbols like the letter A, a dollar sign, an exclamation mark, a smiley face, and a car, these constitute a set. Regardless of whether these are numbers, symbols, or other objects, they form a set when grouped together.

The objects within a set are called elements. For instance, in our example: A is an element of the set; the dollar sign is an element; and so on. However, we don't randomly group things together without proper representation. There is a mathematical notation for sets.

To represent a set mathematically:

1. Write the name of the set followed by an equal sign.
2. Use curly braces `{}` to enclose and list the elements separated by commas.

For example:
- Let $A = \{\text{A}, \$, !, \text{smiley face}, \text{car}\}$.

This notation includes:
- The name of the set (e.g., $A$)
- Curly braces `{}` known as braces or set brackets
- Elements separated by commas

Sets are typically named using capital letters (e.g., $A$, $B$, $C$), while elements inside are represented by lowercase letters if they are alphabetic characters.

If you want to indicate that there are infinitely many elements in a set:
- Use ellipses `...` at the end before closing with braces.
  
Example:
- $A = \{a,\$,!,...\}$

These three dots `...` (ellipsis) mean "and so on."

**Symbol for Element Membership**

To denote that an object is an element of a set:
- Use the symbol $\in$.

For instance:
- If you have $A = \{B, 1, 0, \text{sad face}\}$:
  - To say "1 is an element of $A$", write: $1 \in A$.
  - To say "B is in $A$", write: $B \in A$.

To indicate that something is not an element of a set:
- Use the symbol with a line through it: $\notin$.

For instance:
- If C is not in this set: $C \notin A$.
- If 7 is not in this set: $7 \notin A$.

This concludes our discussion on sets and their notation. Let's proceed to study related topics in subsequent lectures.
