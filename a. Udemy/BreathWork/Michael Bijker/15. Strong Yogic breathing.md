### **A Comprehensive Guide to a Three-Round Yogic Breathing Practice for Energy and Awareness**

This document outlines a powerful, seated yogic breathing practice designed to enhance physical health, open energetic pathways, and prepare the practitioner for deeper states of meditation.

#### **1. Core Philosophy and Purpose**

This practice is more than a simple breathing exercise; it is a foundational step towards working with the subtler layers of the self. The core philosophy rests on a few key principles:

- **Preparation for Deeper States:** These strong breathing rounds act as a preparation for calmer, slower practices that facilitate deep meditation and a connection to your true, higher nature. The initial intensity helps clear the physical and energetic "noise," allowing for more profound stillness later.
    
- **The Reality of Energy (Prana):** The practice works directly with the body's energy, or _prana_. This energy is not an abstract concept but the very force that enables movement, speech, heartbeat, nerve signals, and cellular metabolism (e.g., glucose combustion). This practice teaches you to first feel, and eventually influence, these life-force energies.
    
- **Unity (Yoga):** The ultimate goal is to move towards a state of "Yoga," which means unity. By the end of the practice, the aim is to rewire the brain to feel states of completeness, gratitude, and thankfulness, fostering a sense of inner wholeness.
    

#### **2. The Physical and Energetic Benefits**

This technique has a profound impact on both the body and mind.

**Physical Benefits:**

- **Resets the Respiratory System:** Strong, conscious breathing opens up the entire respiratory system, correcting shallow or blocked breathing patterns that may have developed due to stress and tension. This helps ensure proper breathing even during daily life and sleep.
    
- **Optimizes Gas Exchange:** It floods the body with oxygen, ensuring cells can function and produce energy properly. Simultaneously, it expels excess carbon dioxide.
    
- **Alkalizes the Body:** High levels of carbon dioxide create an acidic internal environment, which is conducive to disease and ailments. By purging CO2, this practice helps to alkalize the blood and body, resulting in more energy, vitality, and overall health.
    

**Energetic & Mental Benefits:**

- **Opens Energy Channels:** The practice is designed to unblock and open all the subtle energy channels (_nadis_) in the body.
    
- **Clears Energetic Barriers:** The force of the breath can help you push through mental and energetic barriers, releasing stored tension and emotional blockages.
    
- **Creates Space for Consciousness:** By cleansing the system, you create more "space" for consciousness to flow freely, allowing you to become more fully aware of your complete self.
    

#### **3. Preparation and Posture**

Proper preparation is key to receiving the full benefits of the practice.

1. **Sitting Position:** Assume a comfortable but upright sitting position with a straight, open spine. Refer to proper sitting posture guides if needed.
    
2. **Hand Position (Mudra):** Your hands can either rest open on your knees (palms up, to receive energy) or be held in _Jnana Mudra_ (the tip of the index finger touching the tip of the thumb).
    
3. **Initial Relaxation:** Before beginning, take a few calm, slow breaths.
    
    - Disconnect from your current mental and physical state.
        
    - Consciously relax your facial muscles and shoulders.
        
    - Feel your connection to the ground beneath you.

### **4. The Breathing Technique: A Step-by-Step Guide**

The practice consists of three rounds of active breathing, each followed by a period of breath retention.

#### **The Three Rounds of Active Breathing**

Each breath should be a full, powerful cycle: inhale from the belly, expanding into the heart, and finally into the upper chest for a complete, expansive inhalation, followed by a full, releasing exhalation.

- **Round 1:** 15 Breaths
    
- **Round 2:** 21 Breaths
    
- **Round 3:** 34 Breaths
    

Maintain a continuous, connected rhythm. Imagine you are climbing a mountain and need to push through with effort to reach the top. Try to leave the thinking mind behind and focus solely on the action of breathing.

#### **Phase 1: Exhale Breath Retention (Kumbhaka)**

1. At the end of the final breath in the last round, take one last **full inhalation**.
    
2. **Exhale only halfway out**.
    
3. **Hold the breath still** (suspend the breath).
    
4. During this hold:
    
    - Remain relaxed. There should be no need to breathe.
        
    - Keep the facial muscles soft.
        
    - Maintain your inner awareness. Observe the sensations in your body—tingling, energy, stillness. Let it all happen without judgment.
        
    - You can gently focus your awareness between the eyebrows (the "third eye" area).
        
    - Hold for as long as you feel comfortable, without any strain.
        

#### **Phase 2: Inhale Breath Retention with Bandhas (Energy Locks)**

1. When you feel the need to breathe again, take **one full, deep inhalation**.
    
2. **Hold the breath in**.
    
3. Apply the **Bandhas** (energy locks) for 10-15 seconds:
    
    - **Mula Bandha:** Gently constrict the muscles around the perineum/genitals.
        
    - **Uddiyana Bandha:** Gently pull the lower belly in and up.
        
    - **Jalandhara Bandha:** Bring the chin down towards the chest.
        
4. Feel the sense of expansion and contained energy within the torso.
    
5. **Release the locks** and exhale slowly.
    

#### **Phase 3: Recovery Between Rounds**

After each full cycle (active breathing and both retentions), take a few moments to relax. Catch your breath and allow it to become very calm and soft before proceeding to the next round.

#### **5. Post-Practice Integration and Closing Ritual**

After completing all three rounds, do not rush. The integration period is one of the most important parts of the practice.

1. **Settle into Stillness:** Allow everything to calm down. Feel the spaciousness you have created—an "ocean of consciousness" within you. Float in this state of pure being for as long as you wish.
    
2. **Slow, Calm Breathing:** Let your breath be natural, slow, and serene.
    
3. **Closing Sequence:** When you are ready to finish the session:
    
    - Bring your hands together in front of your forehead.
        
    - Gently place your warm palms over your closed eyes, allowing them to relax.
        
    - Give your body a little massage (face, neck, shoulders) as a gesture of self-care.
        
    - **Generate a Positive State:** Intentionally cultivate a feeling of **completeness, gratitude, and thankfulness**. This final step is crucial for rewiring your brain towards positivity and embodying the principle of Yoga (unity).
        

#### **6. Important Considerations and Safety**

- **Listen to Your Body:** This is a powerful practice. It is important not to push yourself into a state of severe discomfort.
    
- **Discomfort vs. Pain:** A small amount of discomfort can be a sign that you are pushing through an energetic barrier; you can continue with awareness. However, if you feel genuine pain, dizziness, or significant distress, **stop immediately**. Relax, breathe normally, and attempt the practice with less intensity next time.
    
- **Modifying the Intensity:** If you feel that a round is too intense (especially the final round of 34 breaths), feel free to do fewer breaths or breathe with less force. Your safety and well-being are paramount.
