# 🧩 Topic 5: IP Fragmentation — Full and Clear Rewrite

---

## 📦 What Is IP Fragmentation?

**IP Fragmentation** happens when a packet is **too large** to travel through a network segment (or link) that has a **smaller Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)**.

Instead of dropping the oversized packet, the IP layer **breaks it into smaller pieces (fragments)**, sends them across the network, and then the **destination host reassembles** the original packet.

> 🧠 Think of it like sending a big box through several tunnels — if the box won’t fit through one of the tunnels, you unpack it, send each smaller part separately, and reassemble it on the other side.

---

## 📏 What’s MTU?

The **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** is the largest amount of data that can be transmitted in a single frame on a given link layer.

- On Ethernet, the default MTU is typically **1500 bytes**.
    
- If you try to send a packet **larger than the MTU**, it must be **fragmented** (unless Path MTU Discovery prevents this).
    

> ✨ MTU applies to the **payload of the frame** — so IP must ensure that its entire packet (IP header + data) fits within this size.

---

## 🔧 When and Where Fragmentation Happens

Fragmentation is handled at the **IP layer**, not at the TCP or application level.

Here’s how it works:

1. **The original sender** (or an intermediate router) checks if the packet is **too large** for the outgoing link.
    
2. If yes, and if fragmentation is allowed, the packet is **split into fragments**.
    
3. These fragments are sent individually, each with its **own IP header**.
    
4. The **final destination host** puts the fragments back together in the correct order.
    

> 📌 Only the **destination** host reassembles fragments — routers never do.

## 🧱 IP Header Fields for Fragmentation

Several key fields in the IP header help with fragmentation:

|Field|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Identification**|A unique ID to group all fragments of the same original packet|
|**Flags**|Includes the "More Fragments" (MF) bit and "Don't Fragment" (DF) bit|
|**Fragment Offset**|Indicates the position of the fragment's data in the original packet|

### Example:

If a 3000-byte packet is fragmented:

- **Fragment 1:** Offset = 0, MF = 1, Data = bytes 0–1479
    
- **Fragment 2:** Offset = 185, MF = 1, Data = bytes 1480–2959
    
- **Fragment 3:** Offset = 370, MF = 0, Data = bytes 2960–2999
    

(Note: Offset is in **units of 8 bytes**)

## 🚨 Don't Fragment (DF) Bit and Path MTU Discovery

There’s a special bit in the IP header called **Don't Fragment (DF)**.

- If DF is set, and the packet is too big to pass through a network, **it will be dropped**.
    
- The router then sends back an **ICMP "Fragmentation Needed"** error to the sender.
    

This mechanism is used by **Path MTU Discovery**, where the sender learns the **smallest MTU** along the path and adjusts the packet size to avoid fragmentation altogether.

> 🛡 Modern networks prefer **avoiding fragmentation** because it's fragile and inefficient.

## 📤 Fragmentation in Action — Real Scenario

Let’s say:

- You’re sending a packet from your laptop to a server.
    
- The packet is 4000 bytes.
    
- One of the routers in the middle has an MTU of 1500 bytes.
    

Here’s what happens:

1. The router sees that 4000 > 1500 → fragmentation is needed.
    
2. The router **splits** the packet:
    
    - 1st fragment: bytes 0–1479
        
    - 2nd fragment: bytes 1480–2959
        
    - 3rd fragment: bytes 2960–3999
        
3. All fragments are forwarded independently.
    
4. The destination host waits until **all fragments arrive**, then **reassembles** them based on their Identification number and Offset.
    

---

## 🧨 What Can Go Wrong?

1. **If one fragment is lost**, the whole original packet is **discarded**. Reassembly fails.
    
2. Fragmentation adds **overhead** — each fragment carries its **own IP header**.
    
3. Intermediate routers can't reassemble — so large paths with variable MTUs are fragile.
    

That’s why most systems today use **Path MTU Discovery** to avoid fragmentation entirely by **sending smaller packets** that fit through every link in the path.

---

## 🚫 Fragmentation in IPv6

In **IPv6**, fragmentation is **not done by routers** at all.

- Only the **source host** is allowed to fragment.
    
- Routers will **drop** oversized packets and return an ICMPv6 “Packet Too Big” error.
    

This forces all systems to use **Path MTU Discovery** as the default behavior.

---

## 🧠 Summary

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Fragmentation**|Splitting large IP packets into smaller parts to fit MTU limits|
|**MTU**|Maximum size of a packet that can pass through a network link|
|**Only at Destination**|Reassembly happens only at the destination, never in between|
|**IP Header Fields**|Identification, More Fragments (MF), Don't Fragment (DF), Fragment Offset|
|**DF Bit + ICMP**|Enables Path MTU Discovery to avoid fragmentation|
|**IPv6**|Does not allow routers to fragment — only source hosts can do it|
