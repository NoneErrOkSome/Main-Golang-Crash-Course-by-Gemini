Could you please rewrite the entire transcript in your own words, staying true to the original scope and intent of the lecture? I found the way the concept  was explained extremely confusing, and I’d like a much clearer version.

Please also correct any inaccuracies or unclear points from the original explanation. Feel free to take as much space as needed—I'm looking for a thorough, detailed rewrite that improves clarity while staying faithful to the topic.
