To **fully explain** everything from this monologue in an organized, structured, and educational way, here's how I recommend **breaking it down**:

---

## ðŸ”§ **Client-Server Architecture â€” Breakdown Plan**

### **Part 1: The Origin of Client-Server Architecture**

- Why it was a _revolution_.
    
- Moving away from mainframes.
    
- The concept of cheap client machines vs beefy servers.
    
- Core motivation: separate workload for scalability and cost.
    

---

### **Part 2: The Purpose of Separation**

- What does it mean to separate an application into components?
    
- Monoliths vs components.
    
- The concept of _heavy_ tasks: CPU, RAM, latency, etc.
    
- Benefits of moving expensive tasks to the server.
    

---

### **Part 3: Microservices Connection**

- How client-server inspired microservices.
    
- Breaking down monoliths â†’ microservices.
    
- Pros & cons briefly (including the speakerâ€™s critique of overuse).
    

---

### **Part 4: Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**

- What is an RPC?
    
- Early RPCs: no standards, just communication.
    
- Evolution to standard RPC protocols like gRPC.
    
- gRPC as a modern application of client-server calls.
    

---

### **Part 5: Benefits of Client-Server Architecture**

- Centralized server logic.
    
- Lightweight clients â†’ faster, smaller binaries.
    
- Resource separation (e.g., drivers, databases only on server).
    

---

### **Part 6: Rise of Edge Computing**

- What is edge computing?
    
- Lightweight computation on client/IoT devices.
    
- Trend of moving _some_ compute back to the edge.
    

---

### **Part 7: The Role of Dependencies**

- What are dependencies in a monolith?
    
- How client-server reduces dependency spread.
    
- Example: DB drivers needed only on server side.
    

---

### **Part 8: Three-Tier Architecture**

- What is the three-tier model?
    
- How it relates to client-server.
    
- View as a specialization of client-server.
    

---

### **Part 9: The Need for Standards**

- Communication without standards = chaos.
    
- Importance of defining how bits travel.
    
- Leads to protocols, networking models.
