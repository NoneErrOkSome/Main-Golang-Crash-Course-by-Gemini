Absolutely. Let's dive into **Part 4**, where Hussein walks us through one of the most **tangible, real-world walkthroughs** in networking: the **end-to-end life of a POST request**. He shows how a request travels **from a client**, through each OSI layer **down to the physical medium**, then **across the network**, and finally **up the stack on the server**, all while interacting with hardware and protocols in between.

This is not a summary — it’s a meticulous unpacking of every step using the structure and logic Hussein laid out.

## 📘 PART 4 — _How a POST Request Travels Through the OSI Model (Client to Server)_

---

### 🎯 Let’s Start With a POST Request

Imagine you're building a typical web application — maybe a Node.js app or a Python backend — and on the client side, you're using **Axios** or `fetch()` to send a `POST` request to `https://api.example.com`.

Let’s break down what _actually_ happens, layer by layer.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Layer 7 – Application (Client)

Your app calls `fetch("/api/todo", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({task: "write OSI notes"}) })`.

This is layer 7:

- The **HTTP method** is `POST`.
    
- The **body** is a JSON payload.
    
- The target is a secure endpoint: `https://`.
    

At this point, all you see is a high-level API. You don’t see TLS handshakes. You don’t see retries. You don’t see framing, segmentation, routing, nothing.

But that’s about to change, because **this high-level command is about to descend the OSI stack.**

---

### 📦 Layer 6 – Presentation (Encoding and Serialization)

Before the data can be transmitted, the JSON object is:

- **Serialized** to a string.
    
- **Encoded** in UTF-8 (or whatever the default encoding is).
    
- Prepared for encryption if TLS is enabled.
    

So now your `{task: "write OSI notes"}` becomes:

```json
{"task":"write OSI notes"}
```

→ then encoded as bytes (like ASCII or UTF-8) → then handed down to the session layer.

This layer ensures the data is **language-agnostic**, **platform-agnostic**, and **ready for encryption**.

---

### 🔐 Layer 5 – Session (Connection Setup & TLS)

Now your browser or HTTP client says: “Do I already have a **TLS session** with this server?”

If not:

- It initiates a **TLS handshake**.
    
- Exchanges **certificates**.
    
- Establishes a **shared symmetric key**.
    
- Possibly does **session resumption** if you’ve connected before.
    

This is layer 5 — the logic that manages:

- Secure connection state.
    
- TLS handshake and session caching.
    
- Negotiation of cipher suites.
    

If it’s an HTTPS request, the session layer also says:

> “We need to establish a TCP connection before I can encrypt anything.”

So it pauses the HTTP request and drops the task down to layer 4.

---

### 📨 Layer 4 – Transport (Connection & Port Awareness)

The client now begins the famous **TCP 3-way handshake**:

1. Sends a **SYN** to the server's IP address on **port 443**.
    
2. Server replies with **SYN-ACK**.
    
3. Client replies with **ACK**.
    

Only **after this handshake** can we say: “The connection exists.”

No app data is sent during this handshake. Once it’s done, the client gets the green light from session layer: “Alright, connection is established, go ahead.”

Then:

- The full encrypted payload (serialized JSON + HTTP headers) is chunked into **TCP segments**.
    
- These segments are wrapped with **source port**, **destination port**, **sequence numbers**, and **checksums**.
    

These segments are now passed down to the network layer.

---

### 🌐 Layer 3 – Network (IP Addresses and Routing)

Each TCP segment is:

- Wrapped inside an **IP packet**.
    
- Assigned a **source IP** (your computer) and **destination IP** (the server).
    

If you didn’t already know the server’s IP, this is where a **DNS query** was triggered beforehand (also its own OSI sequence).

The IP packet includes fields like:

- **TTL (Time to Live)**.
    
- **Protocol (TCP = 6)**.
    
- **Packet length**.
    

The full TCP segment (with port data) is just seen as “data” here — the network layer only cares about **getting it to the destination**.

Now the packet is handed to the data link layer for local delivery.

---

### 🧷 Layer 2 – Data Link (Frames and MAC Addresses)

Before we can actually send this packet on the wire, we need to:

- Wrap it in an **Ethernet frame**.
    
- Add a **source MAC** (your network card).
    
- Add a **destination MAC** (either the gateway or the next hop).
    

To find the destination MAC address (e.g. your router's), your system might perform an **ARP lookup**:

- “Who has IP 192.168.1.1? Tell me your MAC.”
    
- “Here I am: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff.”
    

This frame also includes:

- **Frame length.**
    
- **CRC checksum.**
    
- **Type (IPv4, IPv6).**
    

Now we’re finally ready for the physical layer.

---

### ⚡ Layer 1 – Physical (Sending the Bits)

The full Ethernet frame is:

- Translated into **electrical signals** (Ethernet),
    
- Or **light pulses** (fiber),
    
- Or **radio waves** (Wi-Fi or LTE).
    

Your NIC (network interface card) takes the 1s and 0s and **converts them to signals** appropriate for the hardware medium.

This is what’s literally **sent across the wire** (or through the air).

---

## 🔄 On the Server Side: From Bits to Express Route

Let’s reverse the process.

### 📥 Physical → Data Link

- Server receives electrical, light, or radio signals.
    
- NIC reconstructs the **frame**.
    
- CRC is verified.
    
- MAC address is inspected.
    
    - “Is this frame addressed to me?”
        
    - If yes → pass to IP.
        

### 📦 Network Layer

- Extract the **IP packet**.
    
- Check **destination IP**.
    
    - “Is this IP mine?”
        
- If yes → extract TCP segment.
    

### 📨 Transport Layer

- Reconstruct the **TCP stream** from all received segments.
    
- Validate **sequence numbers**, **ACKs**, **window size**.
    
- Decrypt TLS (done just above).
    
- Reassemble full HTTP message.
    

### 🔐 Session & Presentation

- TLS session is resumed or validated.
    
- HTTP headers are decrypted.
    
- JSON payload is decrypted.
    
- Encoded bytes are deserialized into an object.
    

### 🧑‍🍳 Application Layer

- The server (Express, Flask, etc.) receives the POST route.
    
- Triggers your `app.post("/api/todo")` handler.
    
- You process the request, hit a DB, and return a response.
    

That response travels **back down the stack**, is re-encoded, re-encrypted, re-segmented, repackaged, reframed, re-sent — all the way back to the client.
