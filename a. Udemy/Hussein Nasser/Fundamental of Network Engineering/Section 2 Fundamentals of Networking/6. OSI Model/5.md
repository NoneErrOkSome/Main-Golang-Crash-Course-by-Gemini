Absolutely. In **Part 5**, Hussein walks us through what happens **in the middle of the network** — the infrastructure between the client and the server. This is where switches, routers, firewalls, proxies, and content delivery networks (CDNs) step in. They _inspect_, _forward_, _drop_, or even _rewrite_ your traffic — and they all operate at **different OSI layers**.

This is where we shift from just "sending and receiving" to understanding **how data is handled, shaped, redirected, and filtered in flight**.

## 📘 PART 5 — _The OSI Model in Transit: Switches, Routers, Proxies, and Firewalls_

---

### 🧭 What Happens Between the Client and Server?

Let’s assume you're a client sending a POST request to a server. You’ve already gone down the OSI layers, through the physical medium — but that data doesn’t just teleport to the server.

It passes through **devices in the middle**:

- Switches
    
- Routers
    
- Firewalls
    
- Load balancers
    
- Reverse proxies
    
- Transparent proxies
    
- CDNs
    

Each of these devices inspects the traffic **at a different OSI layer**. Knowing this helps you:

- Understand what a device can “see.”
    
- Know where to troubleshoot or monitor.
    
- Optimize for performance or security.
    

Let’s walk through each of these layers in transit.

---

### 🔹 First Stop: Switch (Layer 2)

A **switch** is the first thing your frame might encounter inside your local network (LAN).

It inspects **only the Data Link layer (Layer 2)**:

- It doesn’t care about IPs.
    
- It doesn’t care about ports.
    
- It doesn’t care about TLS or HTTP.
    

It just looks at:

- **Destination MAC address**.
    
- **Source MAC address**.
    
- Updates its internal **MAC address table**.
    

It uses this table to decide:

- Which physical port should this frame be sent out of?
    
- Should I broadcast this frame?
    
- Or drop it?
    

Switches _don’t go up_ the stack. They **never touch layers 3, 4, or above** — unless it's a "Layer 3 switch," which behaves like a router.

So if a switch receives a frame where the destination MAC address is known, it forwards it on that port and moves on. It’s very fast.

---

### 🔹 Next Hop: Router (Layer 3)

The frame now hits a **router**.

The router operates at the **Network layer (Layer 3)**:

- It extracts the **IP packet** from the Ethernet frame.
    
- It checks the **destination IP address**.
    
- It consults its **routing table** to figure out:
    
    - “Which next-hop should I forward this packet to?”
        

Routers may have:

- **Static routes**
    
- **Dynamic routing protocols** (like OSPF, BGP)
    

But here's the key: the router _never_ looks at:

- TCP or UDP ports (Layer 4)
    
- Application content (Layer 7)
    

It only sees IP headers.

Routers are also responsible for:

- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** — mapping private IPs to public IPs.
    
- **TTL decrementing** — and dropping packets if TTL hits zero.
    
- **ICMP messages** (e.g. Destination Unreachable, TTL Exceeded)
    

Routers go **up to Layer 3** and then back **down to Layer 1** as they forward traffic.

---

### 🔹 Middleboxes That Go Higher: Firewalls & Proxies

Now we’re getting into devices that **go up the OSI stack**.

#### 🔒 Firewalls (Layer 3, 4 — sometimes 7)

Most basic firewalls inspect:

- **Source and destination IP (Layer 3)**
    
- **Source and destination port (Layer 4)**
    
- **Protocol (TCP/UDP)**
    

They apply **rules**:

- “Block all inbound traffic to port 22.”
    
- “Drop packets from this suspicious IP.”
    
- “Allow only traffic to port 443.”
    

These are **Layer 3/4 firewalls**.

Some advanced firewalls also inspect **application data**, like:

- URLs in HTTP requests.
    
- Hostnames in SNI (Server Name Indication).
    
- Payload contents.
    

These are **Layer 7 firewalls** — they decrypt traffic and **understand the app protocol**. They are **slower** and require **TLS termination**.

---

### 🔁 Transparent Proxies (Layer 4)

Transparent proxies are placed **invisibly** between the client and server.

They:

- **Do not modify requests**.
    
- **Do not terminate TLS**.
    
- Only see:
    
    - IP address
        
    - Port
        
    - Maybe SNI field in TLS handshake
        

Transparent proxies and firewalls are **called “transparent”** because:

- The client doesn’t know they’re there.
    
- They don’t change the path or payload.
    
- They silently inspect or block traffic.
    

ISPs and governments **often use these** to block traffic based on destination IP or port.

> They work because IP and port information is **always unencrypted** — it must be visible to route the packet.

---

### 🔁 Layer 4 Proxy (NAT, Port Rewriting)

A **Layer 4 proxy** goes further than just inspecting traffic. It **rewrites packets** based on port numbers.

For example:

- Client sends traffic to port **80**.
    
- Layer 4 proxy intercepts and changes destination to port **8080** on an internal server.
    
- Rewrites **source port** too, so the response flows back correctly.
    

These proxies don’t care about:

- Hostnames.
    
- Paths.
    
- Cookies.
    
- JSON.
    

They just handle **raw TCP connections**.

This is **faster**, but limited — you can’t route based on `/api/users`, because that’s only visible at Layer 7.

---

### 🌐 Layer 7 Proxy (Reverse Proxy / CDN)

This is where things get _deep_.

Layer 7 proxies (like **Nginx**, **Envoy**, **CDNs like Fastly**) go **all the way up to the Application layer**.

They:

- **Terminate the TLS session** — they must decrypt the traffic.
    
- **Parse the HTTP protocol**.
    
- **Read the Host, Path, and Headers**.
    
- Can:
    
    - **Cache responses**.
        
    - **Route based on paths**.
        
    - **Rewrite URLs**.
        
    - **Add headers**.
        
    - **Balance load between backends**.
        

But they pay a price:

- **They must fully decrypt and re-encrypt**.
    
- **They create a second TLS session** to the backend.
    
- **They must parse full application content**.
    

In OSI terms:

- They go **from Layer 1 to Layer 7** on the inbound request.
    
- Then rebuild the outbound request from **Layer 7 back down to Layer 1**.
    

That’s why CDNs are so powerful — and also **so intrusive**. They **see everything**. And they become the “real” endpoint for clients.

> “To the client, your CDN _is_ the server. But the CDN is actually a middleman.” — Hussein

### 🔄 The Flow of a Request Through the Network

Let’s walk through an example path again:

1. **Client sends POST request to HTTPS API**.
    
2. **Switch** forwards based on **MAC address**.
    
3. **Router** forwards based on **IP address**.
    
4. **Firewall** inspects **IP + Port**, maybe blocks or allows.
    
5. **Layer 4 proxy** redirects traffic to a new backend port.
    
6. **Layer 7 proxy / CDN** decrypts, inspects headers, rewrites, caches.
    
7. **Server** finally receives the decrypted HTTP request and processes it.
    

Each layer inspects _more_:

- L2: just MAC
    
- L3: IP
    
- L4: TCP port
    
- L7: full application
    

And each step costs more **latency**, **compute**, and **trust**.

---

### 🧠 What Makes a Device “Live” at a Layer?

Hussein makes it clear: it’s not about _what the device is_, but **what it looks at**.

If a proxy:

- Inspects TCP but not HTTP → **Layer 4**
    
- Decrypts and reads HTTP headers → **Layer 7**
    
- Cares only about MAC addresses → **Layer 2**
    

Some devices even **span multiple layers**. For example:

- A firewall that inspects both IP and port lives in **L3/L4**.
    
- A CDN that decrypts traffic and routes by URL lives in **L7**, but must also be aware of **L3 and L4**.
    

The deeper a device goes, the more it **understands**, **modifies**, or **controls** the traffic — and the more **power** (and **responsibility**) it has.
