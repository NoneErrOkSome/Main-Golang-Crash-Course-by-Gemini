Perfect. In **Part 6**, Hussein focuses on the **limitations of the OSI model**, the reasoning behind the simplified **TCP/IP model**, and how engineers deal with the sometimes-blurry lines between layers. He also shares his own personal evolution in how he thinks about OSI over time — from skepticism to appreciation — especially as a backend engineer.

This section goes deep into the philosophy of systems design: how **abstractions are tools**, not rigid rules.

### 🧱 The OSI Model Isn’t Perfect — And That’s Okay

Hussein admits something upfront: the OSI model, while powerful, has **some real shortcomings**. Even though he now finds it deeply useful, there was a time when he thought:

- "Why do we have **seven layers**?"
    
- "Do we really need to separate out **presentation** and **session** from application?"
    
- "This just seems like **academic overhead**."
    

These are common complaints from engineers:

- “It’s too theoretical.”
    
- “Nobody actually uses layer 6 and 5.”
    
- “Just call it the application and be done.”
    

And Hussein sympathizes — but also explains how his opinion **evolved** as he began to understand **real-world use cases** that map to those "ignored" layers.

### 💡 Layers Are Mental Tools — Not Absolute Truths

Here’s the big insight:

> **There is no such thing as a physical "Layer 6" on your machine.**
> 
> It’s just a way for humans to talk about responsibilities.

When engineers say “my app lives in layer 7” or “this proxy operates at layer 4,” they’re not reading a label off the NIC. They're using **a shared mental model** to describe:

- What data the system touches.
    
- What kind of logic it performs.
    
- Where in the network stack that logic sits.
    

So the OSI model is **a language** — not a blueprint. It exists to **help us communicate precisely** as developers, ops engineers, and system architects.

If you keep that in mind, it’s easier to avoid the trap of:

- “This layer is useless.”
    
- “This layer doesn’t make sense.”
    
- “Nobody really implements this.”
    

It’s not about whether your code “imports the session layer.” It’s about **where your code fits in the communication chain**.

### 🧬 The TCP/IP Model: A Simpler View

The **TCP/IP model**, also known as the **Internet Protocol Suite**, is the more **pragmatic, widely adopted model** used by most systems engineers and developers today.

It has **fewer layers**:

|TCP/IP Layer|Corresponding OSI Layers|
|---|---|
|Application|7, 6, 5|
|Transport|4|
|Internet|3|
|Link|2, 1|

Here’s the deal:

- **Application** covers everything you write — HTTP, JSON, TLS, gRPC.
    
- **Transport** is TCP, UDP, QUIC.
    
- **Internet** is IP routing, addressing.
    
- **Link** is Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addressing.
    

This model says: **Let’s not split hairs.** Let’s group everything that app developers care about (serialization, encryption, session) into one big **Application Layer**.

---

### 🧠 But What Do We Lose by Simplifying?

If you merge layers 5–7 into one, you lose **the ability to speak precisely** about things like:

- Who manages **TLS handshakes**?
    
- Who is responsible for **serialization**?
    
- Who controls **connection pooling** or **session state**?
    

If everything is “the app,” then:

- A proxy that **only** manages connections (like Linkerd) becomes hard to describe.
    
- A library that **only** serializes JSON or protobuf becomes invisible.
    

That’s why Hussein still values the full OSI model. Not because it’s perfect, but because it lets you say things like:

- “Envoy is a layer 7 proxy.”
    
- “Linkerd operates at layer 5.”
    
- “This encoding library is purely layer 6.”
    

That **precision in conversation** matters — especially when debugging or designing systems that **span multiple layers**.

---

### 🎯 Personal Preference: Finer Grains Enable Better Thinking

Hussein admits: early on, he was in the “TCP/IP is enough” camp.

But over time, as he:

- Debugged deeper network issues,
    
- Built infrastructure with multiple moving parts,
    
- Worked with proxies, encryption, session-aware load balancers…
    

He realized that the **distinctions between layers 5, 6, and 7** were not just theory — they were **practical engineering domains**.

That’s why he now **prefers the full OSI model**, even if it’s more verbose. It allows him to think:

- “Where should this logic live?”
    
- “What do I have visibility into at this layer?”
    
- “Am I decoding data, managing connections, or routing content?”
    

Each question maps cleanly to a layer:

- **Decoding?** → Layer 6
    
- **Managing sessions?** → Layer 5
    
- **Parsing and routing HTTP?** → Layer 7
    

This level of clarity is valuable when you’re designing or debugging complex distributed systems.

---

### 🧱 Why Numbering Layers Gets Confusing

One of Hussein’s tips is:

> “Avoid using layer numbers unless you **specify the model** you’re referring to.”

For example:

- In **OSI**, Layer 5 is the Session layer.
    
- But in **TCP/IP**, there is **no Layer 5**.
    
- So if someone says, “This is a Layer 5 device,” you have to ask: “OSI or TCP/IP?”
    

To avoid confusion:

- Say **Transport Layer**, not “Layer 4.”
    
- Say **Application Layer**, not “Layer 7.”
    
- Only use numbers if everyone is clear on the model.
    

This helps prevent architectural misunderstandings, especially in global teams where people might be trained in different models.

---

### 🔚 Not Everything Needs a Layer

There’s another subtle point here: not every system **maps cleanly** to all 7 layers.

For example:

- A **switch**? Layer 2.
    
- A **router**? Layer 3.
    
- A **firewall**? Maybe layer 4 or 7.
    
- A **CDN**? Operates across layers 3 to 7, depending on its features.
    

Some apps span multiple layers. Some devices never go above Layer 2. Others jump straight to Layer 7 and terminate the whole connection.

The OSI model doesn’t mean that **everything has to use every layer** — it just offers a lens to describe what any given device or program **does**.

---

### 🧠 Core Takeaway

You don’t have to believe that each layer **exists physically**.

But as a backend engineer:

- You **send JSON** → Layer 6.
    
- You **initiate TLS** → Layer 5.
    
- You **write Express routes** → Layer 7.
    
- You **configure ports** → Layer 4.
    
- You **understand IP headers** → Layer 3.
    

Using the OSI model helps you **pinpoint where your app is operating**, what it depends on, and what problems might arise when things go wrong.
