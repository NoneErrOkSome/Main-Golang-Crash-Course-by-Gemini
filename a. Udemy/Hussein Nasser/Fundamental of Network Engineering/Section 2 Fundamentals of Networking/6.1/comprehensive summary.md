### 📌 **Why We Need a Communication Model**

- To create **agnostic applications** that work across different mediums like **Wi-Fi, Ethernet, LTE, Fiber**, without writing separate code for each.
    
- Without a standard model, your app would need **explicit knowledge of the physical medium**.
    
- Enables **upgrading network hardware** independently (e.g., replacing Ethernet with Fiber without rewriting your app).
    
- Allows **innovation** at each layer independently, such as improving radio transmission without touching the IP or TCP stack.

### 🏗️ **What Is the OSI Model?**

A **7-layer model**, each layer describing a networking role:

|Layer|Name|Responsibilities|
|---|---|---|
|7|Application|HTTP, FTP, gRPC|
|6|Presentation|Encoding, serialization (e.g., JSON)|
|5|Session|Connection setup/teardown, TLS|
|4|Transport|TCP/UDP, ports, segmentation|
|3|Network|IP addressing and routing|
|2|Data Link|MAC addresses, Ethernet frames|
|1|Physical|Electrical, optical, or radio signals|

### 📤 **Sending a POST Request (Sender Side Flow)**

1. **Layer 7 (Application)**: App sends a POST request with JSON body.
    
2. **Layer 6 (Presentation)**: JSON is serialized to a byte stream.
    
3. **Layer 5 (Session)**: TLS is established; TCP session is managed.
    
4. **Layer 4 (Transport)**: Sends TCP SYN to port 443.
    
5. **Layer 3 (Network)**: SYN is encapsulated in IP packet with source/destination IP.
    
6. **Layer 2 (Data Link)**: Packet becomes a frame with source/destination MAC.
    
7. **Layer 1 (Physical)**: Frame is transmitted as bits via electrical/light/radio signal.

### 📥 **Receiving the Request (Receiver Side Flow)**

1. **Layer 1**: Physical bits are received.
    
2. **Layer 2**: Bits reassembled into frames.
    
3. **Layer 3**: Frames reassembled into IP packets.
    
4. **Layer 4**: TCP segments extracted and ordered (congestion, flow control, etc.).
    
5. **Layer 5**: Session identified (TCP handshake).
    
6. **Layer 6**: Bytes are deserialized back into JSON.
    
7. **Layer 7**: App processes the request (e.g., Express.js handles POST).

### 📎 **Key Concepts and Insights**

- Each layer **adds metadata (headers)** to the payload from the layer above.
    
- These layers form a **"Russian Doll" structure**, where outer layers encapsulate the inner ones.
    
- The OSI model allows **layer-specific innovation** (e.g., faster physical mediums or smarter transport protocols).

### 🛠️ **Example Applications at Different Layers**

|Device/Software|Layer(s)|
|---|---|
|Load Balancer (L7)|7|
|Proxy (Transparent)|4 or 3|
|Firewall|3 or 4|
|VPN|3|
|LinkerD, Envoy|5|
|Express.js, Django|7|

### 🧱 **Criticism and Simplification**

- The OSI model is often **too detailed** (especially layers 5 and 6).
    
- Many engineers prefer the **TCP/IP model**, which condenses layers 5-7 into one "Application Layer".
    
- Still, Hussein **prefers the OSI model** for its fine-grained breakdown, especially for **back-end engineers** working with proxies, sessions, or serialized data.

### 🔐 **Why It Matters**

- Understanding where your app “lives” in the OSI model helps you debug, optimize, and design better systems.
    
- Examples:
    
    - A reverse proxy decrypting HTTPS → operates at Layer 7.
        
    - A TCP load balancer → operates at Layer 4.
        
    - A CDN caching images based on path → Layer 7.

### 🔄 **Final Thought**

> “Know where your app lives. Are you looking at MACs, IPs, segments, or serialized JSON? That’s your lens through the OSI model.” — Hussein Nasser
