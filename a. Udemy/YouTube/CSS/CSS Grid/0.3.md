### Responsive Design Techniques

1. **Understanding the Need for Responsiveness**
   - Explain why responsiveness is important in modern web design.
   - Discuss how responsive grids help in maintaining layout consistency across devices.

2. **Using the `minmax()` Function**
   - The `minmax()` function is a powerful tool in CSS Grid that allows you to set a minimum and maximum size for grid tracks (columns or rows).
   - Syntax: `minmax(min, max)`
     - `min`: the smallest size the track can be.
     - `max`: the largest size the track can grow to.
   - Example: Using `minmax(100px, auto)` ensures that a column or row will shrink no smaller than 100px but can grow based on available space.

3. **Creating Responsive Columns with `minmax()`**
   - Demonstrate how to use `minmax()` to make columns adjust as per screen size.
   - Example: `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(100px, 1fr));` creates three columns that won't shrink below 100px but will share available space equally using fractions (`fr`).

4. **Adjusting Rows Responsively**
   - Similar to columns, rows can also be made responsive using `minmax()`.
   - Example: Setting row heights like `grid-template-rows: minmax(200px, auto);` where the row height adjusts according to content but won't go below 200px.

5. **Handling Browser Window Resizing**
   - When users resize their browser windows, responsive grid layouts should automatically adjust.
   - Example Demonstration: Show how decreasing the browser window width shrinks the column until it reaches its minimum defined by `minmax()`.

6. **Practical Examples of Responsive Grids**
   - Provide examples or scenarios where responsive grid techniques are applied:
     - A gallery layout where images resize and rearrange based on screen dimensions.
     - A product listing page where item cards adapt their sizes and number per row according to screen width.

7. **Testing Responsiveness**
   - Encourage testing layouts in various browsers and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Use developer tools (
