Certainly! Part 2, "Defining Columns and Rows," focuses on how to set up the basic structure of a grid in CSS by defining columns and rows. This part is crucial because it lays the foundation for creating a functional grid layout. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what this section would cover:

### 1. **Using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`**

- **Purpose**: These properties are used to define the number of columns and rows in a grid container and their respective sizes.
  
- **Syntax**:
  - `grid-template-columns`: Defines the width of each column.
  - `grid-template-rows`: Defines the height of each row.

### 2. **Working with Pixel Values**

- **Fixed Sizes**: 
  - You can specify fixed sizes using pixel values (e.g., `150px`). This approach gives you precise control over the dimensions, which is useful when you need elements to maintain exact sizes regardless of screen size.

- **Example Code**:
  ```css
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 150px 100px; /* Two columns with fixed widths */
    grid-template-rows: 200px; /* One row with a fixed height */
  }
  ```

### 3. **Using Percentage Values**

- **Flexible Sizes**:
  - Percentage values allow columns or rows to be flexible, adapting to the size of their container. This is beneficial for creating layouts that are responsive to varying screen sizes.

- **Example Code**:
  ```css
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 34%; /* Three columns taking up equal parts */
    grid-template-rows: auto; /* Row height adjusts based on content */
  }
  ```

### Additional Notes

- When using percentages, ensure that they add up appropriately within your layout context (e.g., three columns should sum up to approximately or exactly `100%`).

By understanding how to define columns and rows using these methods, you can create both rigid and flexible layouts tailored to your design needs. This foundational knowledge is essential for building more complex grids as you progress with CSS Grid Layouts.
