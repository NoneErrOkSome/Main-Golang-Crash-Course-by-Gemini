00:00:00.040 the CSS grid layout is a gamechanging
00:00:02.360 tool for creating complex layouts for
00:00:04.680 your websites but what exactly is a grid
00:00:06.960 layout a very basic grid could look like
00:00:09.760 that and a more complex one containing
00:00:12.160 the most important parts of a website
00:00:14.200 could look like this in general grids
00:00:16.640 consists of columns and rows and this is
00:00:19.720 some basic code for creating a grid with
00:00:21.960 CSS to enable the grid layout for a
00:00:24.240 container we have to set the display
00:00:26.439 property to grid and then if we set grid
00:00:29.400 template columns to 3 * 50 pixels we are
00:00:32.719 creating a grid with three columns which
00:00:35.200 are 50 pixels in size and now let's jump
00:00:38.079 into the code and have a look at the
00:00:39.600 details but before we start please make
00:00:41.920 sure to hit a like button and subscribe
00:00:43.960 to the channel so we can help even more
00:00:46.079 people learning about the CSS grid
00:00:47.960 layout okay so let's get started as
00:00:50.520 always I have prepared a simple HTML
00:00:52.640 file for you which only consists of nine
00:00:54.920 different containers and we want to
00:00:56.680 create a grid for the containers now so
00:00:59.160 to enable the grid we have to set the
00:01:01.440 display property to grid okay but as you
00:01:04.799 can see nothing has changed in the
00:01:06.240 browser because we haven't defined any
00:01:08.200 columns or rows yet so let's use the
00:01:10.680 grid template columns property to Define
00:01:13.000 columns we start out with a single
00:01:14.880 column which is 150 pixels wide and as
00:01:17.759 you can see the width of the column
00:01:19.280 changes to 150 pixels let's define a
00:01:22.439 second column which is 100 pixels in
00:01:24.720 size and as you can see in the browser
00:01:26.799 now we have two columns and the
00:01:28.439 containers are placed into the columns
00:01:30.280 automatically let's add the third column
00:01:32.720 and this time it should be 100 pixels
00:01:34.640 again great now have a look at the
00:01:37.000 browser and you will see that our three
00:01:38.680 columns will appear according to our
00:01:40.399 code we have only worked with pixel
00:01:42.799 values so far but we can also use
00:01:44.920 percentage values for defining our
00:01:46.680 columns let's try it out by creating
00:01:48.640 three columns which have a size of 33%
00:01:51.880 each similar to The Grid template
00:01:54.280 columns property the grid template rows
00:01:56.640 property Works to define the sizes of
00:01:59.119 rows check it out we have just set the
00:02:01.360 size of the first row to 200 pixels
00:02:04.119 let's continue and set the second row to
00:02:06.119 100 pixels and the third row to 200
00:02:09.560 pixels the minmax function can help us
00:02:12.440 creating grids which are responsive that
00:02:14.800 means that the size of a column or row
00:02:17.000 adjusts to the available screen size the
00:02:19.239 minmax function takes two arguments the
00:02:21.640 first one defines the minimum size and
00:02:23.879 the second one the maximum size setting
00:02:26.200 the maximum size to Auto will make the
00:02:28.400 column grow infinitively now let's have
00:02:30.760 a look what will happen if we change the
00:02:32.800 size of the browser window we decrease
00:02:34.840 the size of the window and the column
00:02:36.519 will shrink until it reaches the 100
00:02:38.879 pixels minimum size next let's try out
00:02:42.000 the minmax function for the rows and
00:02:43.879 let's set the minimum size of the first
00:02:45.879 row to 200 pixels and the maximum size
00:02:48.519 to Auto again to make that work we have
00:02:51.000 to set the height of the container to
00:02:52.720 100% when we decrease the height of the
00:02:55.000 browser window now we will see that the
00:02:56.959 first row will shrink until it reaches
00:02:59.319 its minimum minimum size of 200
00:03:01.840 pixels the repeat function is another
00:03:04.519 very helpful tool we can use for
00:03:06.599 creating our grids the repeat function
00:03:08.879 also has two arguments the first one
00:03:11.239 defines how many times we want to repeat
00:03:13.280 a row or column and the second argument
00:03:15.799 defines the size in this case we want to
00:03:18.239 create three columns of 150 pixels and
00:03:21.680 three rows of 150 pixels have a look at
00:03:24.360 the browser and you will see that our
00:03:26.040 containers are little squares now so far
00:03:28.959 we have only worked with pixel values
00:03:31.280 and percentage values but grids
00:03:33.159 introduce a whole new unit to CSS the
00:03:36.159 so-called fraction unit using the
00:03:38.280 fraction unit we can also create
00:03:40.159 responsive grids similar to the minmax
00:03:42.400 function you can compare the fraction
00:03:44.439 unit to the flex grow and Shrink
00:03:46.480 properties of the flex layout here we
00:03:48.599 have created three columns the first and
00:03:50.720 second column are one fraction wide and
00:03:52.760 the third column two fractions so we
00:03:54.920 have a total of four fractions so two
00:03:57.560 fractions is equal to 50%
00:04:00.239 and one fraction is equal to 25% and if
00:04:03.760 we change the third value to four
00:04:05.680 fractions we will have a total of seven
00:04:08.040 fractions so one fraction will be
00:04:10.159 approximately 14% And two fractions
00:04:14.360 28% next we're going to learn how to
00:04:16.720 define gaps between the rows and Columns
00:04:18.880 of a grid so I already have removed the
00:04:21.040 margins from the containers so we are
00:04:23.040 ready to define the gaps now to define
00:04:25.400 the gaps between the rows of a grid we
00:04:27.600 have to use the grid row Gap property
00:04:30.680 let's set it to 5050 pixels and to
00:04:33.080 achieve the same thing for the columns
00:04:35.000 we have to use the grid column Gap
00:04:37.400 property and now have a look at the
00:04:39.320 browser and you will see that we have
00:04:41.240 gaps between the columns and the rows of
00:04:43.639 our grid the grid Gap property allows us
00:04:47.120 to create gaps for rows and columns with
00:04:50.000 just a single property the first value
00:04:52.400 defines the gaps between the rows and
00:04:54.479 the second defines the gaps between The
00:04:56.560 Columns of our grid aligning items
00:04:59.840 within our grids work similar to the
00:05:01.919 flex layout we can use the same
00:05:04.000 properties like justify content and
00:05:06.440 align content or align items and giving
00:05:09.560 them values like space around space
00:05:12.120 between or space evenly to distribute
00:05:15.000 our items across the screen and the
00:05:17.639 center value is used for centering our
00:05:20.080 items of course up until now all of our
00:05:23.400 grid items are only taking up a single
00:05:26.039 cell of the grid but the CSS grid layout
00:05:28.639 allows us to span items across multiple
00:05:31.479 cells of the grid let's have a look at
00:05:33.360 how to accomplish that to make an item
00:05:36.199 span multiple Columns of the grid we can
00:05:38.600 use the grid column start property which
00:05:41.400 defines the column where the item should
00:05:43.720 start and the grid column end property
00:05:46.440 which defines where the item should end
00:05:48.880 to make box one span the whole grid we
00:05:51.759 set the grid column start to one and
00:05:54.120 grid column end to four but wait why
00:05:57.400 four and not three our grid only only
00:05:59.840 have three columns the answer to that is
00:06:02.080 very simple the values are not referring
00:06:04.199 to the actual column but to the column
00:06:06.199 lines to the left and right of the
00:06:08.160 columns have a look at the browser and
00:06:10.199 the numbers on top of the grid they are
00:06:12.080 indicating the column lines so now the
00:06:14.400 values 1 and four for grid column start
00:06:17.039 and grid column end makes sense right
00:06:19.639 now we want to repeat that but this time
00:06:21.639 we want to span the item across multiple
00:06:24.039 rows so we set the grid row start
00:06:26.360 property to two and the grid row end
00:06:28.639 property to six have a look at the grid
00:06:31.039 and the row line numbers and you will
00:06:32.800 see that box two spans from row line 2
00:06:35.759 to six defining grid column start and
00:06:38.520 grid column end with just a single
00:06:40.400 property is also possible by using grid
00:06:43.199 column it has two values separated with
00:06:45.400 a slash where the first one is grid
00:06:47.599 column start and the second one is grid
00:06:49.919 column end and of course we can do the
00:06:52.400 same thing with grid row and it works
00:06:55.000 just the same way like grid column two
00:06:56.919 values separated by a slash we can even
00:06:59.800 take it to the next level by combining
00:07:01.879 all four values into a single property
00:07:04.440 the grid Area Property the first two
00:07:06.919 values represent grid row start and grid
00:07:09.759 column start and the last two values
00:07:12.039 represent grid row end and grid column
00:07:14.960 end next let's practice another very
00:07:17.680 cool feature of the CSS grid layout I'm
00:07:20.240 talking about grid template areas I have
00:07:23.240 prepared four different containers for
00:07:25.000 you representing the main layout parts
00:07:27.160 of a typical website header content
00:07:29.759 sidebar and footer and now we are going
00:07:32.280 to learn how to use grid template areas
00:07:35.000 to position the containers in a grid the
00:07:37.759 grid template areas property takes a
00:07:40.280 single string for each row of the grid
00:07:42.680 and inside of the row we Define The
00:07:44.360 Columns which are separated by a space
00:07:47.120 we can give the columns any name we want
00:07:49.479 basically similar to setting an ID to an
00:07:51.639 HTML element we want to create a two
00:07:54.240 column grid and we want the header to
00:07:56.240 span the two columns so we write header
00:07:59.000 space header in the second row we want
00:08:01.639 to display the content to the left and
00:08:03.919 the sidebar to the right so we write
00:08:06.440 content space sidebar and in the third
00:08:09.680 row we want the footer to spend two
00:08:11.560 columns just like the header so we write
00:08:14.120 footer space footer but before our grid
00:08:17.639 template areas will work we have to
00:08:19.680 define the areas to each of the
00:08:21.400 containers let's start with the header
00:08:23.560 and set the grid Area Property to header
00:08:26.919 and repeat the step for Content sidebar
00:08:29.879 and footer and as you can see our grid
00:08:32.399 will take up the shape just as we have
00:08:34.360 defined it with the grid template Area
00:08:36.719 Property header and footer take up two
00:08:39.399 columns whereas content and sidebar
00:08:42.000 share a single row okay we have reached
00:08:44.880 the end of this video thank you for

### Encouragement for Practice

To solidify understanding, it's important to encourage practicing these concepts through real-world examples and exercises.

#### Example Code for Practice

Here's an example code snippet that incorporates several key concepts from CSS Grid Layout:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
            grid-template-rows: auto;
            gap: 10px;
        }

        .header {
            background-color: lightblue;
            grid-column: 1 / span 3; /* Span across all columns */
        }

        .content {
            background-color: lightgreen;
        }

        .sidebar {
            background-color: lightcoral;
        }

        .footer {
            background-color: lightsalmon;
            grid-column: 1 / span 3; /* Span across all columns */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
    <div class="header">Header</div>
    <div class="content">Content</div>
    <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
    <div class="footer">Footer</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

### Practice Recommendations

- **Experiment with Different Layouts**: Try creating different web page structures using CSS Grid.
  
- **Responsive Design Challenges**: Adjust your grids to be responsive by experimenting with viewport sizes.

- **Refactor Existing Code**: Take existing HTML/CSS projects and refactor them using CSS Grid to improve layout efficiency.

By encouraging learners to practice these techniques hands-on, they can better understand how to implement CSS Grid in real-world scenarios effectively.
