Certainly! Let's dive into Part 1: **Introduction to CSS Grid Layout**. In this section, we'll cover the basics and set the foundation for understanding CSS Grid.

### Part 1: Introduction to CSS Grid Layout

#### Overview of CSS Grid
- **What is CSS Grid?**
  - CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool that allows developers to create complex and responsive web layouts.
  - It is a two-dimensional layout system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows simultaneously.
  - The grid layout simplifies the process of designing web pages with various sections that need precise alignment.

- **Why Use CSS Grid?**
  - It offers more control over layout compared to traditional methods like floats or inline-blocks.
  - Enables the creation of more sophisticated and flexible layouts without extensive use of media queries.
  
#### Basic Structure: Columns and Rows
- **Defining Grids**
  - A grid is essentially a series of intersecting horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) lines that divide a page into sections, allowing for easy placement of elements.
  
- **Components of a Grid:**
  - **Columns:** Vertical divisions in the grid. You can have as many columns as needed for your design.
  - **Rows:** Horizontal divisions in the grid. Like columns, rows help structure content vertically.

#### Enabling Grid Layout with `display: grid`
- To start using the grid layout on an HTML element, you need to set its `display` property to `grid`.
  
```css
.container {
    display: grid;
}
```

- This establishes the element as a grid container, making all direct children items become grid items.

#### Practical Example:
1. Assume we have an HTML file with nine different containers.
2. To enable these containers to participate in a grid layout:
   ```html
   <div class="container">
       <div class="item">1</div>
       <div class="item">2</div>
       ...
       <div class="item">9</div>
   </div>
   ```

3. Apply basic styling to make `.container` a grid:
   ```css
   .container {
       display: grid; /* This enables the grid layout */
   }
   ```

4. Result:
   - Initially, setting `display: grid` alone won't change how items appear because no specific column or row sizes are defined yet.
