Based on the transcript you provided, Part 3 could be titled "Main Components/Aspects of Responsive Web Design Techniques." This section would focus on explaining the key techniques and components discussed in the video for achieving better responsive web design without relying on Flexbox or Grid. Below is a detailed explanation of each technique with example HTML/CSS code snippets.

### Part 3: Main Components/Aspects of Responsive Web Design Techniques

1. **Relative Padding**

   The video introduces a method for using relative padding that adapts to different screen sizes by combining fixed and relative units using the `min()` function in CSS.

   ```html
   <div class="container">
       Content goes here...
   </div>
   ```

   ```css
   .container {
       padding: min(5em, 8%);
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `padding` property uses the `min()` function to apply either 5em or 8% of the viewport width, whichever is smaller, ensuring appropriate padding on both desktop and mobile screens.

2. **Responsive Font Sizes**

   Responsive font sizes can be achieved using a combination of viewport width (VW) units and more traditional units like REM. The `clamp()` function ensures font sizes remain within specified bounds.

   ```html
   <h1 class="responsive-heading">Responsive Heading</h1>
   ```

   ```css
   .responsive-heading {
       font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 10vw, 5rem);
       /* Alternative method using calc() */
       /* font-size: calc(7vw + 1rem); */
   }
   ```

   Here, `clamp()` ensures that the font size scales with the viewport width but does not exceed a maximum or fall below a minimum size. This scaling helps maintain readability across devices.

3. **Responsive Images**

   To ensure images are responsive without distortion, set a maximum width and use auto height. Additionally, use `aspect-ratio` and `object-fit` properties to maintain consistent image dimensions while preserving content integrity.

    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Responsive Image" class="responsive-image">
    ```

    ```css
    .responsive-image {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
        aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
        object-fit: cover; /* Or object-fit: contain; depending on design needs */


        background-color: red; /* To visualize empty spaces with object-fit: contain */
    }
    ```

   In this setup, `max-width: 100%` ensures the image does not exceed the container's width, while `height: auto` maintains the image's aspect ratio. The `aspect-ratio` property sets a consistent dimension for images, and `object-fit: cover` or `object-fit: contain` adjusts how the image fits within that space.

### Explanation:

These three techniques aim to improve responsive web design by using CSS features that allow elements to adjust dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a more adaptable and visually appealing layout. By utilizing relative units, functions like `min()`, `clamp()`, and combining them with viewport-based units like VW, developers can create more fluid designs without relying on media queries or complex layout strategies.

- **Relative Padding**: This technique allows developers to specify padding that adjusts based on the screen size by using a combination of fixed and relative units. The CSS function `min()` evaluates given values and applies the smallest one, ensuring padding remains appropriate across different devices.

- **Responsive Font Sizes**: Using viewport units alongside REM for font sizing ensures text scales proportionally with screen width. The `clamp()` function provides further control by setting minimum and maximum font sizes, which is crucial for maintaining readability without excessive line breaks or oversized text on large screens.

- **Responsive Images**: Ensuring images adapt to varying screen sizes involves setting constraints on their dimensions while preserving their aspect ratios using properties like `max-width`, `height`, and `aspect-ratio`. The use of `object-fit` determines whether images should cover the entire space (potentially cropping parts) or be fully contained (possibly leaving empty spaces).

These techniques provide effective strategies for crafting responsive layouts tailored to diverse viewing environments while minimizing reliance on traditional layout tools such as Flexbox or Grid.
