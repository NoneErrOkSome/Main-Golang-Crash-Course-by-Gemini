### Tip 4: Viewport Height Unit (100vh vs dvh)
This part of the transcript addresses a common issue with using the `100vh` unit in CSS for responsive design, particularly on mobile devices.

#### Problem:
- Using `100vh` (100% viewport height) can cause issues on mobile devices because it doesn't account for browser UI elements like the address bar. This may result in content that slightly exceeds the visible screen area, causing unwanted scrolling.

#### Solution:
- The solution is to use the new `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) unit. This unit considers UI elements and adjusts accordingly to fit perfectly within the screen's visible area.

#### Example Code:

Here's an example of how you would set up an element to use both `vh` and `dvh`, ensuring compatibility across different browsers:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Responsive Viewport Height Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
        }

        .full-screen-element {
            /* Use dvh for dynamic viewport height */
            height: 100dvh;
            /* Fallback to vh if dvh is not supported */
            height: 100vh;
            background-color: lightblue;
            box-sizing: border-box;
            border: 5px solid blue; /* To visualize element boundaries */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="full-screen-element">
    This div should cover the full visible screen height.
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:

1. **CSS Styling**:
   - The `.full-screen-element` class is applied with two `height` values:
     - `height: 100dvh;`: The preferred method for modern browsers that support this new unit.
     - `height: 100vh;`: A fallback for older browsers that do not support `dvh`.
   - The element uses a light blue background with a blue border to make

 sure it stands out on the page. The light blue background provides a subtle contrast that draws attention without being overpowering, while the blue border adds definition and clarity to the element. This combination is effective in highlighting important information or calls-to-action, ensuring that they catch the user's eye immediately upon landing on the page. 

In addition to its visual appeal, this use of color can evoke feelings of trust and calmness, which are often associated with shades of blue. This can be particularly beneficial for elements related to security features, customer testimonials, or any content that aims to reassure or build confidence in the user.

Furthermore, when designing web pages or digital interfaces, using consistent color schemes like this across different elements can help maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the site. This not only enhances user experience by providing visual harmony but also reinforces brand identity if these colors align with your brand's palette.

Overall, employing a light blue background with a blue border for specific elements is an effective design strategy to ensure key information is noticed and appreciated by users.
