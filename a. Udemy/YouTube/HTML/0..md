2. **Background/Context**:
   - Offer any necessary background information.
   - Discuss the context in which the topic exists.

3. **Main Components/Aspects**:
   - Identify and explain the key components or aspects.
   - Each component can be a separate section if needed.

4. **Analysis/Discussion**:
   - Dive deeper into each component.
   - Include analysis, comparisons, or discussions as necessary.

5. **Challenges/Issues**:
   - Address any challenges, problems, or controversies related to the topic.

6. **Case Studies/Examples**:
