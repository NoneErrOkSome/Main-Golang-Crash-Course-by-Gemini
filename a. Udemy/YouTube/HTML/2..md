To explain Part 2, which is the "Background/Context" for the topic of responsive web design based on the transcript provided, I will elucidate the relevant concepts and provide some example HTML/CSS code where applicable.

### Background/Context: Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is a critical aspect of modern web development that ensures websites look good and function well across various devices and screen sizes. The background context for responsive web design involves understanding several key concepts and techniques:

1. **Responsive Units**: 
   - These are CSS units that adapt to different screen sizes. Examples include `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw` (viewport width), and `vh` (viewport height).
   - Example: Using `vw` for font sizes allows text to scale with the width of the viewport.

2. **CSS Functions**:
   - Functions like `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` help create flexible layouts by allowing developers to specify conditions under which certain values should apply.
   - Example: The `min()` function can be used to ensure padding doesn't exceed a certain size on smaller screens.

3. **Media Queries**:
   - Although not directly discussed in this transcript, media queries are usually employed in responsive design to apply styles based on device characteristics such as width, height, or orientation.

4. **Flexible Layout Models**:
   - Flexbox and Grid layout models offer powerful ways to create responsive designs without relying solely on media queries.
   
5. **Challenges of Responsive Design**:
   - Handling different screen sizes without creating separate designs for each.
   - Ensuring elements do not overflow or become too small on certain devices.

### Example HTML/CSS Code

Let's look at an example that demonstrates some of these concepts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Responsive Design Example</title>
    <style>
        /* Basic reset */
        * {
            box-sizing: border-box;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        /* Container with relative padding */
        .container {
            padding: min(5em, 8%);
            background-color: lightgray;
        }

        /* Responsive font size using clamp */
        h1 {
            font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 10vw
        

, 5rem);
            text-align: center;
        }

        /* Responsive image */
        img {
            max-width: 100%;
            height: auto;
            aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
            object-fit: cover;
        }

        /* Full viewport height section with dvh */
        .full-height-section {
            height: 100dvh; /* Use dvh for dynamic viewport height */
            background-color: cornflowerblue;
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Responsive Web Design Tips</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="full-height-section">
        <p>This section spans the full height of the viewport.</p>
    </div>

    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Sample Image">

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

- **Responsive Units**:
  - The `min()` function is used for the `.container` padding, ensuring it adjusts based on the smaller value between a fixed unit (`5em`) and a percentage of the parent container (`8%`).
  
- **Responsive Font Sizes**:
  - The `clamp()` function in the `h1` element's font size ensures that it scales with the viewport width, but doesn't go below `1.8rem` or above `5rem`.

- **Responsive Images**:
  - The image has a `max-width` of `100%`, ensuring it resizes to fit its container. It also uses an aspect ratio to maintain consistent dimensions, and `object-fit: cover` ensures it covers the entire space without distortion.

- **Dynamic Viewport Height (dvh)**:
  - The `.full-height-section` utilizes `100dvh`, which dynamically adjusts for mobile UI elements like address bars.

This example illustrates how CSS techniques can be applied to create responsive designs that adjust fluidly across different devices and screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience.
