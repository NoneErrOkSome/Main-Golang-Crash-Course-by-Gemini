Concatenation of arrays or vectors in Rust is quite straightforward. Let's consider you have two vectors `vec1` and `vec2` and you want to concatenate them.

Here is an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec![4, 5, 6];

    let mut result = vec1.clone();
    result.extend(vec2);

    println!("{:?}", result);  // prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In this example, `extend` method is used to append all elements from `vec2` to the end of `vec1`. Please note that `clone` is used because `extend` takes ownership of `vec1`. If you want to keep `vec1` and `vec2` unchanged after the operation, cloning is necessary.

Also, please note that the type of `vec1` and `vec2` should be the same for this operation to work.

If you are dealing with arrays instead of vectors, you would typically convert them into vectors before concatenating, as Rust's built-in arrays do not have a built-in method for concatenation. Here is an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

    let mut vec = arr1.to_vec();
    vec.extend_from_slice(&arr2);

    let result: Vec<i32> = vec;
    
    println!("{:?}", result);  // prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In this example, `to_vec` is used to convert `arr1` to a vector and `extend_from_slice` is used to append `arr2` to the end of this vector.

In a competitive programming context, you'll typically read inputs from stdin, perform some operation (like concatenating arrays), and then print the result. Let's assume the problem is to read two arrays of integers from stdin and print their concatenation.

Here's how you could solve this problem using Rust:

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();

    // Read and parse first array
    let arr1: Vec<i32> = lines
        .next()
        .unwrap()
        .unwrap()
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|num| num.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
        .collect();

    // Read and parse second array
    let arr2: Vec<i32> = lines
        .next()
        .unwrap()
        .unwrap()
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|num| num.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
        .collect();

    // Concatenate arrays
    let mut result = arr1.clone();
    result.extend(arr2);

    // Print result
    for num in result {
        print!("{} ", num);
    }
}
```

This program reads two lines from stdin, each representing an array of integers (with elements separated by spaces). It parses these lines into `Vec<i32>`s, concatenates them using the `extend` method, and then prints the result.

Note that in competitive programming, you often don't worry about error handling or robustness as much as you would in a real-world application. For example, this program assumes that the input is well-formed and doesn't handle any parsing errors. In a real-world application, you would want to handle such errors appropriately.

---
In a real-world context, your Rust code will likely be more modular and robust. The actual operation of concatenating arrays or vectors is similar to the competitive programming example, but you might wrap it in a function that could be reused in different parts of your code.

For instance, you might have a function like this:

```rust
fn concatenate<T: Clone>(arr1: &[T], arr2: &[T]) -> Vec<T> {
    let mut result = arr1.to_vec();
    result.extend_from_slice(arr2);
    result
}
```

This function takes two slices as input and returns a new vector that is the concatenation of the two slices. It uses the `to_vec` method to convert the first slice to a vector, and then the `extend_from_slice` method to append the second slice to the end of this vector. The `T: Clone` bound is needed because these methods require the elements to be `Clone`.

You could use this function in your application like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

    let result = concatenate(&arr1, &arr2);

    println!("{:?}", result);  // prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In this case, we're still concatenating two arrays of integers, but the `concatenate` function could be used with arrays or vectors of any type that implements `Clone`. This makes the code more reusable and flexible.

Furthermore, in a real-world application, you might need to handle possible errors or edge cases, and your code might interact with other parts of your application or with external systems. For example, the arrays could come from a file, a database, or a network request, and the result could be used in further computations, stored back to a database, sent over the network, etc. The actual concatenation operation would likely be just a small part of the overall logic.
