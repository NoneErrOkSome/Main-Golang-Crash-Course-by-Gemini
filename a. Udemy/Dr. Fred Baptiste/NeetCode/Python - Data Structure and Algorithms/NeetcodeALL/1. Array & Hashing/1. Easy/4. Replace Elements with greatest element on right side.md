The key syntax components for solving the "Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side" problem in Rust are:

1. **Vector**: In Rust, you would typically use a vector (`Vec<T>`) to represent the list of integers that you are processing. 

    ```rust
    let arr = vec![17, 18, 5, 4, 6, 1];
    ```

2. **Functions**: The `replace_elements` function would take a vector of integers and return a new vector of integers. The type signatures might look something like this:

    ```rust
    fn replace_elements(arr: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
        // ...
    }
    ```

3. **Iterating over a Vector in Reverse**: To process the elements from right to left, you can use the `iter().rev()` method to get an iterator that yields the elements in reverse order. However, if you need to mutate the elements, you'll need to use indices to access them.

    ```rust
    for i in (0..arr.len()).rev() {
        // ...
    }
    ```

4. **Tracking the Maximum Value**: To replace each element with the greatest element to its right, you'll need to keep track of the maximum value seen so far. 

    ```rust
    let mut max_right = -1;
    ```

5. **Updating Vector Elements**: You can use the index syntax (`arr[i]`) to get or set the value of a vector element.

    ```rust
    arr[i] = max_right;
    ```

6. **Updating the Maximum Value**: To keep `max_right` up-to-date, you'll need to take the maximum of `max_right` and the current element. You can use the `max` method for this.

    ```rust
    max_right = max_right.max(arr[i]);
    ```

7. **Return Statement**: The `return` keyword is used to exit a function and optionally return a value.

    ```rust
    return arr;
    ```

These are the main syntax components involved in a typical Rust solution to this problem. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem, other components might also be needed.

Certainly! Here's the complete code with all the syntax components combined:

```rust
fn replace_elements(arr: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut max_right = -1;
    
    for i in (0..arr.len()).rev() {
        let current = arr[i];
        arr[i] = max_right;
        max_right = max_right.max(current);
    }
    
    arr
}

fn main() {
    let arr = vec![17, 18, 5, 4, 6, 1];
    let result = replace_elements(arr);
    println!("{:?}", result);
}
```

In this code, the `replace_elements` function takes a vector `arr` as input and returns a new vector where each element is replaced with the greatest element on its right side. The function iterates over the vector elements in reverse order and updates the elements and the `max_right` variable accordingly.

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `replace_elements` function by creating a sample vector `arr`, calling the function, and printing the result.
