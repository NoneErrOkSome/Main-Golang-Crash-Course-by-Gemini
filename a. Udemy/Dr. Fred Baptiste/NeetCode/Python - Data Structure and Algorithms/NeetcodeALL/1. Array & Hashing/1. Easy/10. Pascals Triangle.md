Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. It's a pattern of numbers that's named after Blaise Pascal, a famous French Mathematician and Philosopher. 

Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The outside edges of the triangle are always 1. Here's the start of Pascal's Triangle:

```
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
  1 5 10 10 5 1
```

In the above triangle, each number is found by adding the two numbers above it (to the left and right), with positions outside the triangle considered to be 0. 

Pascal's Triangle has a number of interesting properties and contains a number of sequences and patterns:

- The n-th row sums to 2^n.
- The 3rd diagonal gives the triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, etc)
- The 4th diagonal gives the tetrahedral numbers (1, 4, 10, 20, etc)
- If you mark the numbers in the triangle that are divisible by a certain number, you'll get a repeating pattern.
- It's symmetrical; it looks the same if you flip it.

Pascal's Triangle is used in algebra for binomial expansion, in combinatorics to answer questions about picking subsets, in calculus and more. It's one of those beautiful mathematical concepts that has lots of interesting uses and properties.

To generate Pascal's Triangle in Rust, you'll use several key language features:

1. **Vectors**: Vectors are a resizable array type provided by Rust's standard library. In the context of Pascal's Triangle, vectors are used to store each row of the triangle. You can create a new vector with `Vec::new()`, push elements to the end of a vector with `.push()`, and access elements with `[]`.

   Example:
   ```rust
   let mut v = Vec::new();
   v.push(1);
   let first_element = v[0];  // first_element is now 1
   ```

2. **Nested Loops**: Nested loops are used to generate each row of the triangle based on the previous row. The outer loop iterates over each row, while the inner loop generates the elements of a row.

   Example:
   ```rust
   for i in 0..5 {
       for j in 0..i {
           print!("{} ", j);
       }
       println!();
   }
   ```

3. **Conditional Expressions**: Conditional expressions are used to handle the special cases where an element is on the edge of the triangle (and thus has no element above-and-to-the-left or above-and-to-the-right).

   Example:
   ```rust
   let x = if i == 0 || j == 0 || j == i { 1 } else { 2 };
   ```

Here is how you could generate Pascal's Triangle in Rust using these concepts:

```rust
fn pascals_triangle(n: usize) {
    let mut triangle = Vec::new();

    for i in 0..n {
        let mut row = Vec::new();
        for j in 0..=i {
            let element = if j == 0 || j == i {
                1
            } else {
                triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]
            };
            row.push(element);
        }
        triangle.push(row);
    }

    for row in &triangle {
        for &element in row {
            print!("{} ", element);
        }
        println!();
    }
}

fn main() {
    pascals_triangle(5);
}
```

This program generates the first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle. It uses a vector of vectors to store the triangle. For each row, it creates a new vector, calculates the elements of the row based on the previous row, and pushes the row to the triangle. Finally, it prints out the triangle.
