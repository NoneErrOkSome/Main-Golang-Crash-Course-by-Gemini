Pascal's Triangle, while primarily a mathematical concept, has several applications in computer science and programming:

1. **Combinatorics**: Pascal's Triangle is used to calculate combinations, which are often needed in computer science. For instance, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items (also known as "n choose k" or the binomial coefficient) is given by the k-th item of the n-th row of Pascal's Triangle (counting from 0).

2. **Dynamic Programming**: Pascal's Triangle is an example of dynamic programming, as each value is calculated based on previous values. Understanding how to construct Pascal's Triangle can therefore provide insight into dynamic programming techniques, which are a crucial concept in computer science and are used to optimize algorithms by saving intermediate results.

3. **Algorithm Optimization**: The triangle is sometimes used for polynomial interpolation and to calculate binomial coefficients in an optimized way. It can also be used to compute factorials and powers of 2.

4. **Data Structure and Recursion**: Implementing Pascal's Triangle in code can be a good exercise in using data structures (like arrays or lists), recursion, and loops.

5. **Graphics and Game Development**: In computer graphics, particularly in graphical rendering, Pascal's Triangle is used for Bezier surface control points calculation. Also, some game theory problems involving probability and chance might use the principles of Pascal's Triangle.

6. **Error Detecting and Correcting Codes**: Certain classes of error detecting and correcting codes used in computer networking and data transmission utilize polynomial identities that tie back to the coefficients in Pascal's Triangle.

While Pascal's Triangle might not be a daily tool for most developers, understanding it can be beneficial, especially when dealing with problems related to combinations, probability, or any scenario where the triangle's unique number patterns can be utilized.

A practical real-world scenario where Pascal's Triangle is commonly used is in the calculation of combinations. For instance, if you're trying to find out how many different combinations of lottery numbers are possible, or how many different ways you can choose players for a team, you're dealing with combinations, and Pascal's Triangle can be used to find the solution.

Here's an example in Rust where we calculate "n choose k" using Pascal's Triangle:

```rust
fn pascal(n: usize, k: usize) -> usize {
    let mut triangle = vec![vec![0; k+1]; n+1];

    for i in 0..=n {
        for j in 0..=std::cmp::min(i, k) {
            if j == 0 || j == i {
                triangle[i][j] = 1;
            } else {
                triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j];
            }
        }
    }

    triangle[n][k]
}

fn main() {
    let n = 5;
    let k = 3;
    println!("{} choose {} is {}", n, k, pascal(n, k));  // Output: 5 choose 3 is 10
}
```

In this code, we generate the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle, but only up to the `k`-th element of each row (since we're not interested in elements beyond that point). We then use this triangle to calculate "n choose k". The resulting combination count is printed out.

This can be directly applied to real-world scenarios. For example, if you have a team of 5 people (n = 5), and you want to know in how many ways you can form a committee of 3 people (k = 3), you can use the above code, which outputs 10. Thus, there are 10 different ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a team of 5.
