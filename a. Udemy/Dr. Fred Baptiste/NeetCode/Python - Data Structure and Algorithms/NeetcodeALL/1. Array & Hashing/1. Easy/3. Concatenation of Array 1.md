As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Rust's built-in arrays do not have a built-in method for concatenation. This is primarily because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, and concatenating two arrays would involve creating a new array with a different length, which isn't possible with Rust's built-in array type.

However, you can convert arrays into vectors, perform the concatenation, and then convert them back into arrays if needed. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    let b = [4, 5, 6];
    
    let mut v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    v.extend_from_slice(&a);
    v.extend_from_slice(&b);

    let result: Vec<i32> = v;
    println!("{:?}", result);  // prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In this example, `extend_from_slice` is used to append the elements of an array (or any other slice) to a vector. Note that this operation does not consume the original arrays.

Please note that if you're working with dynamically-sized collections, it's usually more idiomatic in Rust to use a `Vec` instead of an array. `Vec` is a type of resizable array, and it provides methods like `push` and `extend` that can be used to easily add elements or concatenate two vectors.
