This is NeetCode. Data Structure and Algorithms. Pls provide details on Valid Anagram 0, step by step. (There are Valid Anagram 0 and 1 in my list)



It seems like you're referring to a problem commonly known as "Valid Anagram," which is frequently encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming. The problem typically involves determining whether two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

I'll provide you with a step-by-step explanation for solving this problem, assuming "Valid Anagram 0" refers to the basic version of this problem:

### Problem StatementAnagram

Given two strings, `s` and `t`, determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Check Lengths**:
   - If the lengths of the two strings are not equal, they cannot be anagrams. In this case, return `False`.

2. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Use a data structure (like a dictionary or list) to count the frequency of each character in both strings.
   - You can use Python's `collections.Counter` for simplicity, which will create a frequency map for each string.

3. **Compare Frequency Maps**:
   - Compare the two frequency maps. If they are identical, then one string is an anagram of the other.
   - If they differ at any point, return `False`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If all checks pass and the frequency maps are identical, return `True`.

### Example Code

Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Step 1: Check if lengths are different
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Count character frequencies
    count_s = Counter(s)
    count_t = Counter(t)
    
    # Step 3: Compare frequency maps
    return count_s == count_t

# Example usage
print(is_anagram("anagram", "nagaram"))  # Output: True
print(is_anagram("rat", "car"))          # Output: False
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the strings (assuming both have equal length). This involves counting characters in both strings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since there are only a fixed number of possible characters (e.g., 26 lowercase English letters).

This approach efficiently determines whether one string is an anagram of another by leveraging hash maps (or dictionaries) to track character counts. It's straightforward and works well within typical input constraints seen in interview settings.
