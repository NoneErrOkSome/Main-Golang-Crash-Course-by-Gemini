To solve the Contains Duplicate problem in Python, you will primarily need the following key syntax components:

1. **For Loops:** In Python, for loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). The for loop runs a block of code for each item in the sequence.

    ```python
    for item in list:
        # block of code
    ```

2. **Set Data Structure:** The set data structure in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It's useful for this problem because it allows you to check for the existence of an item in constant time.

    ```python
    my_set = set()
    my_set.add(item)  # add an item to the set
    item in my_set  # check if an item is in the set
    ```

3. **If Statements:** In Python, if statements are used to test for certain conditions and execute a block of code accordingly.

    ```python
    if condition:
        # block of code executed if condition is True
    ```

4. **Functions:** A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

    ```python
    def function_name(parameters):
        # block of code
    ```

These components can be combined to solve the Contains Duplicate problem as follows:

```python
def contains_duplicate(array):
    # Create an empty set
    hash_set = set()

    # Loop through the array
    for i in array:
        # If an element is already in the hash_set, return True
        if i in hash_set:
            return True
        # If the element is not in the hash_set, add it
        else:
            hash_set.add(i)
    # If we've made it through the loop without finding a duplicate, return False
    return False
```

Certainly! Let's break down the solution to the "Contains Duplicate" problem using the key syntax components mentioned, and I'll also provide some examples based on this solution.

### Problem Explanation
The task is to determine if there are any duplicate elements in a given list. If duplicates exist, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Key Syntax Components Recap

1. **For Loops:** Used to iterate over each element in the list.
2. **Set Data Structure:** Utilized for its property of storing only unique elements.
3. **If Statements:** To check conditions and decide which block of code to execute.
4. **Functions:** To encapsulate code logic into a reusable unit.

### Solution Code

Here's a Python function that implements the solution:

```python
def contains_duplicate(array):
    # Create an empty set
    hash_set = set()

    # Loop through the array
    for i in array:
        # If an element is already in the hash_set, return True
        if i in hash_set:
            return True
        # If the element is not in the hash_set, add it
        else:
            hash_set.add(i)
    # If we've made it through the loop without finding a duplicate, return False
    return False
```

### Examples

Let's apply this function to some example arrays:

1. **Example 1: No Duplicates**

   ```python
   array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   print(contains_duplicate(array))  # Output: False
   ```

   - The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` has no duplicate elements.

2. **Example 2: With Duplicates**

   ```python
   array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
   print(contains_duplicate(array))  # Output: True
   ```

   - The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3]` contains a duplicate element `3`.

3. **Example 3: All Elements Are Same**

   ```python
   array = [7, 7, 7]
   print(contains_duplicate(array))  # Output: True
   ```

   - The array `[7, 7, 7]` consists entirely of duplicates.

4. **Example 4: Empty Array**

   ```python
   array = []
   print(contains_duplicate(array))  # Output: False
   ```

   - An empty array has no elements and hence no duplicates.

This function efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging a set's ability to store only unique values and allows us to determine duplicates in linear time complexity \(O(n)\).

It looks like you are trying to understand how the function `contains_duplicate` works. Let's break down the function and its logic:

```python
def contains_duplicate(array):
    # Create an empty set
    hash_set = set()
    
    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for num in array:
        # Check if the number is already in the set
        if num in hash_set:
            # If it is, we've found a duplicate
            return True
        else:
            # If not, add the number to the set
            hash_set.add(num)
    
    # If no duplicates are found, return False
    return False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Create an Empty Set**: 
   - `hash_set = set()` initializes an empty set called `hash_set`. Sets are used here because they automatically handle duplicate entries and provide average O(1) time complexity for lookups.

2. **Iterate Over Each Element**:
   - The `for` loop goes through each element (`num`) in the input `array`.

3. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - Inside the loop, `if num in hash_set:` checks whether `num` is already present in `hash_set`.
   - If it is present, this means we have encountered a duplicate, so we immediately return `True`.

4. **Add to Set**:
   - If `num` is not found in `hash_set`, it means it's being encountered for the first time, so we add it to the set with `hash_set.add(num)`.

5. **Return False if No Duplicates Found**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates (i.e., without returning `True`), then all numbers were unique, and we return `False`.

### Conclusion:

- This function efficiently checks for duplicate values by leveraging a set's properties.
- Each number from the array is processed one by one; if a number appears more than once during this process, it will be detected as a duplicate.
- This approach has a time complexity of O(n) due to iterating through each element once and using O(1) operations with sets on average.
