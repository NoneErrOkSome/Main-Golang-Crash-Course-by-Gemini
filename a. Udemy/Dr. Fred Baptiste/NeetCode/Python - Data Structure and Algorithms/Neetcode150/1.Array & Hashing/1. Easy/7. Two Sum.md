How two sum is code in python? seem like its a data structure and algorithm. 

The "Two Sum" problem is a classic algorithmic problem often encountered in coding interviews. The goal is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target sum. Here's a common way to solve it using Python:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Create a dictionary to store numbers and their indices
    num_to_index = {}

    # Iterate through the list of numbers
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the complement that would add up to the target
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement is already in our dictionary
        if complement in num_to_index:
            # If it is, we found our pair; return their indices
            return [num_to_index[complement], index]
        
        # Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary
        num_to_index[num] = index

    # If no pair has been found, return an empty list or None
    return []

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```

### Explanation:

- **Dictionary (`num_to_index`)**: We use this to keep track of each number's index as we iterate over the list. This allows us to check efficiently whether we've already seen a number's complement.

- **Iteration**: For each number `num` in `nums`, calculate its complement with respect to `target`.

- **Check Complement**: If the complement exists in `num_to_index`, it means we've previously seen its corresponding pair and can return their indices.

- **Store Number**: If the complement isn't found yet, store the current number and its index for future reference.

This solution operates in O(n) time complexity due to the single pass through `nums` and average O(1) time complexity for dictionary operations.
