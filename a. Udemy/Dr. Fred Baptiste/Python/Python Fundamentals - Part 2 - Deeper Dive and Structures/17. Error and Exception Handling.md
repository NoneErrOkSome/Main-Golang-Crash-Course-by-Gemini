## Python Fundamentals: Error and Exception Handling ðŸš¦

Writing programs that can handle unexpected situations gracefully is a hallmark of robust software engineering. In Python, errors that occur during program execution are managed through a system called **exception handling**. This allows you to "try" a block of code that might fail and "catch" any errors that occur without crashing your program.

---

### Understanding Errors vs. Exceptions

In Python, we generally encounter two types of errors:

- **Syntax Errors:** These are parsing errors that occur before the program even starts running1. They happen when your code violates the rules of the Python language, such as a missing colon, incorrect indentation, or a misspelled keyword. The Python interpreter will refuse to run the code until the syntax is corrected.
    
    Python
    
    ```Python
    # Syntax Error example
    # for i in range(5)  # Missing a colon at the end
    #     print(i)
    ```
    
- **Exceptions:** These are errors that are detected _during execution_2. The code is syntactically correct, but something goes wrong while it runs. For example, trying to divide by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or trying to convert text that isn't a number into an integer. If not handled, an exception will terminate the program.
    
    Python
    
    ```Python
    # Exception example
    # result = 10 / 0 # Raises a ZeroDivisionError
    ```
    

---

### The `try...except` Block

The `try...except` block is the primary mechanism for handling exceptions3.

**Syntax:**

Python

```Python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    # This is the "guarded" block
    pass
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to run if an exception of ExceptionType occurs
    # This block handles the error
    pass
```

1. The code inside the **`try`** block is executed first.
2. If no exception occurs, the `except` block is skipped.
3. If an exception _does_ occur inside the `try` block, Python immediately stops executing the rest of the `try` block and looks for a matching `except` block.
4. If a matching `except` block is found, its code is executed.

---

### Handling Specific Exceptions

It's a best practice to handle specific exceptions rather than using a bare `except:` block (which catches everything and can hide bugs). This allows you to respond differently to different types of errors4.

**Common Exceptions:**

- `ValueError`: An operation receives an argument of the right type but an inappropriate value (e.g., `int("abc")`).
- `TypeError`: An operation is performed on an object of an inappropriate type (e.g., `5 + "hello"`).
- `KeyError`: A dictionary key is accessed that does not exist.
- `IndexError`: A sequence (list, tuple) index is out of range.
- `FileNotFoundError`: A file is opened that does not exist5.
    

You can handle multiple specific exceptions with a single block by putting them in a tuple.

Python

```Python
try:
    num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = int(num_str)
    result = 100 / num
    print(f"100 divided by {num} is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero.")
except Exception as e: # Catch any other exceptions and get the error object
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

---

### The `else` Clause

You can include an optional `else` clause after the `except` block(s). The code in the `else` block runs **only if the `try` block completes successfully** (i.e., no exceptions were raised)6.

This is useful for separating the code that could raise an error from the code that should only run on success.

Python

```Python
try:
    age_str = input("Enter your age: ")
    age = int(age_str)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid age entered. Please enter a number.")
else:
    # This code only runs if the try block was successful
    print("Successfully converted age.")
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult.")
    else:
        print("You are a minor.")
```

---

### The `finally` Clause

An optional `finally` clause can be added. The code in the `finally` block **always runs**, regardless of whether an exception occurred or was handled7.

This is crucial for cleanup actions that must be performed, such as closing a file or releasing a network connection, ensuring that resources are not left open.

Python

```Python
file = None # Define file outside the try block to access it in finally
try:
    file = open("my_data.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print("File content:", content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # This block always executes
    print("Executing the finally block...")
    if file: # Check if the file was successfully opened before trying to close it
        file.close()
        print("File has been closed.")
```

---

### Raising Exceptions (`raise`)

You can manually trigger an exception at any point in your code using the `raise` keyword. This is useful for signaling an error based on your program's specific logic (e.g., invalid input that is otherwise the correct type)8.

Python

```Python
def set_age(age):
    if not isinstance(age, int):
        raise TypeError("Age must be an integer.")
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise ValueError("Age must be between 0 and 120.")
    print(f"Age set to {age}.")

try:
    set_age(25)
    set_age(-10) # This will raise a ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error setting age: {e}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error setting age: {e}")
```

**Output:**

```Python
Age set to 25.
Error setting age: Age must be between 0 and 120.
```

### Creating Custom Exceptions

For more specific error handling unique to your application, you can create your own custom exception types. The standard way is to define a new class that inherits from Python's base `Exception` class9.

Python

```Python
# Define a custom exception
class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    """Raised when an account has insufficient funds for a withdrawal."""
    def __init__(self, balance, amount):
        self.balance = balance
        self.amount = amount
        self.message = f"Attempted to withdraw {amount} with a balance of only {balance}."
        super().__init__(self.message)

def withdraw(balance, amount):
    if amount > balance:
        raise InsufficientFundsError(balance, amount)
    return balance - amount

try:
    new_balance = withdraw(100, 500)
except InsufficientFundsError as e:
    print(f"Transaction failed: {e.message}")
    print(f"  Current Balance: {e.balance}")
    print(f"  Requested Amount: {e.amount}")
```

**Output:**

```
Transaction failed: Attempted to withdraw 500 with a balance of only 100.
  Current Balance: 100
  Requested Amount: 500
```

### Summary

- Python uses **exceptions** to handle runtime errors.
- The **`try...except`** block is used to catch and handle exceptions, preventing your program from crashing.
- It's best practice to handle **specific exceptions** rather than using a bare `except`.
- The **`else`** block runs if the `try` block completes without any exceptions.
- The **`finally`** block runs no matter what, making it ideal for cleanup tasks.
- The **`raise`** keyword allows you to manually trigger exceptions.
- **Custom exceptions** can be created for application-specific error conditions, making your error handling more precise and descriptive.
