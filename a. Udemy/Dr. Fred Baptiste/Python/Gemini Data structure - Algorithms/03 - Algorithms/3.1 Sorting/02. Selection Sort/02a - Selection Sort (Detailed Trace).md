Ah, I understand. That's a great way to organize your notes â€” keeping the main idea in one file and the detailed examples in another. We can definitely do that.

My apologies, I misunderstood. Let's create a new, separate file for that detailed trace.

---

## Recommendation

1. Inside your `03 - Algorithms/Sorting/` folder, create a **new note**.
    
2. A good name for this new file would be: 02a - Selection Sort (Detailed Trace).md
    
    Using 02a will keep it right next to the main 02 - Selection Sort.md note in your file list, so it's easy to see they are related.
    
3. Then, in your main 02 - Selection Sort.md note, you can add a link to this new trace. For example, you could add this line at the bottom:
    
    To see a full example, look at the [[02a - Selection Sort (Detailed Trace)]].
    

This keeps your main note clean and easy to read, but lets you jump to the full details anytime you want.

Here is the content for you to copy and paste into your **new** note, **`02a - Selection Sort (Detailed Trace).md`**.

# Detailed Trace of Selection Sort

### The Setup

First, we start with our variables:

- `numbers` = `[8, 2, 0, 1, 5]`
- `n` = `5`

Now, the main loop begins.

---

### Round 1 (`i` is 0)

- The outer `for` loop starts. **`i` is now 0**.
- **Goal:** Find the smallest number in the whole list and put it in position `0`.

**Finding the Smallest:**

1. We start by _assuming_ the smallest number is at the beginning of our search area. `min_position = i` so **`min_position` is 0**. We are assuming `8` is the smallest for now.
2. Now the inner `j` loop starts. The range is `range(1, 5)`. So, `j` will be `1, 2, 3, 4`.
    - **`j` is 1:** We compare `numbers[1]` (`2`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`8`). Is `2 < 8`? **Yes**. `min_position` is now **1**.
    - **`j` is 2:** We compare `numbers[2]` (`0`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`2`). Is `0 < 2`? **Yes**. `min_position` is now **2**.
    - **`j` is 3:** We compare `numbers[3]` (`1`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`0`). Is `1 < 0`? **No**.
    - **`j` is 4:** We compare `numbers[4]` (`5`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`0`). Is `5 < 0`? **No**.

**The Swap:**

- The `j` loop is finished. The smallest number is at `min_position` **2**.
- We swap `numbers[0]` (which is `8`) with `numbers[2]` (which is `0`).
- The list becomes: `[0, 2, 8, 1, 5]`
- **The `0` is now sorted and locked!**

---

### Round 2 (`i` is 1)

- The outer loop runs again. **`i` is now 1**.
- **Goal:** Find the smallest number in the unsorted part `[2, 8, 1, 5]` and put it in position `1`.

**Finding the Smallest:**

1. We assume `min_position` is **1**.
2. The `j` loop starts. The range is `range(2, 5)`. So, `j` will be `2, 3, 4`.
    - **`j` is 2:** We compare `numbers[2]` (`8`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`2`). Is `8 < 2`? **No**.
    - **`j` is 3:** We compare `numbers[3]` (`1`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`2`). Is `1 < 2`? **Yes**. `min_position` is now **3**.
    - **`j` is 4:** We compare `numbers[4]` (`5`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`1`). Is `5 < 1`? **No**.

**The Swap:**

- The smallest number is at `min_position` **3**.
- We swap `numbers[1]` (`2`) with `numbers[3]` (`1`).
- The list becomes: `[0, 1, 8, 2, 5]`
- **The `0` and `1` are now sorted and locked!**

---

### Round 3 (`i` is 2)

- The outer loop runs again. **`i` is now 2**.
- **Goal:** Find the smallest number in `[8, 2, 5]` and put it in position `2`.

**Finding the Smallest:**

1. We assume `min_position` is **2**.
2. The `j` loop starts. The range is `range(3, 5)`. So, `j` will be `3, 4`.
    - **`j` is 3:** Compare `numbers[3]` (`2`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`8`). Is `2 < 8`? **Yes**. `min_position` is now **3**.
    - **`j` is 4:** Compare `numbers[4]` (`5`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`2`). Is `5 < 2`? **No**.

**The Swap:**

- The smallest number is at `min_position` **3**.
- We swap `numbers[2]` (`8`) with `numbers[3]` (`2`).
- The list becomes: `[0, 1, 2, 8, 5]`
- **The `0, 1, 2` are now sorted and locked!**

---

### Round 4 (`i` is 3)

- The outer loop runs again. **`i` is now 3**.
- **Goal:** Find the smallest number in `[8, 5]` and put it in position `3`.

**Finding the Smallest:**

1. We assume `min_position` is **3**.
2. The `j` loop starts. The range is `range(4, 5)`. `j` will only be `4`.
    - **`j` is 4:** Compare `numbers[4]` (`5`) with `numbers[min_position]` (`8`). Is `5 < 8`? **Yes**. `min_position` is now **4**.

**The Swap:**

- The smallest number is at `min_position` **4**.
- We swap `numbers[3]` (`8`) with `numbers[4]` (`5`).
- The list becomes: `[0, 1, 2, 5, 8]`
- **The `0, 1, 2, 5` are now sorted and locked!**

---

### Final Round (`i` is 4)

- The outer loop runs a final time. **`i` is now 4**.
- The inner `j` loop's range is `range(5, 5)`, which is empty, so it doesn't run. The swap happens between `numbers[4]` and `numbers[4]`. The list does not change.

The outer loop is now finished.

### The Result

`The sorted list is: [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]`
