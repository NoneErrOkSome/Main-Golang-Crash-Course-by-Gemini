Understood. Using pseudo code is an excellent idea. It's a method that programmers use all the time to plan out their logic before writing the real code.

Let's use a pseudo code format that reads like a list of simple, plain English commands.

Here is exactly how I would write the pseudo code trace for **Round 1**. Use this as your example.

---

### Example Pseudo Code Trace: Round 1

```
// --- Round 1 ---
// The list is [5, 3, 1, 4]

START Round 1.

SET i = 0.
ASSUME smallest is at index i. SET min_position = 0.

START scanning the rest of the list.
    j = 1:
    COMPARE item at index j (which is 3) with item at min_position (which is 5).
    3 is smaller than 5. UPDATE min_position to 1.

    j = 2:
    COMPARE item at index j (which is 1) with item at min_position (which is 3).
    1 is smaller than 3. UPDATE min_position to 2.

    j = 3:
    COMPARE item at index j (which is 4) with item at min_position (which is 1).
    4 is not smaller than 1. Do nothing.

END scanning. The smallest item was found at final min_position = 2.

SWAP item at index i (which is 5) with item at min_position (which is 1).

The list is now [1, 3, 5, 4].
END Round 1.
```

### Your Task

Your task is to follow this exact same pseudo code format to write down the trace for **Round 2** (when `i = 1`).

You will start with the list `[1, 3, 5, 4]`. Submit your pseudo code for Round 2 when you are ready for my feedback.

 UPDATE min_position to 1. Does '1' mean index?
---
Yes. That is correct.

In this algorithm, the `min_position` variable does not store the smallest number itself (it does not store the value `3`).

Instead, it only stores the **index**—the position or "address"—of where the smallest number has been found so far.

So, the statement `UPDATE min_position to 1` means: "I have now found a new smallest number, and its location in the list is at **index 1**." This is critical because at the end of the round, the algorithm needs the final _address_ to perform the swap correctly.
