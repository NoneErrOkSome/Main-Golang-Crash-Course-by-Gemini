Yes, you are correct on both points.

The variable `i` gets its very first value from the outer loop `for i in range(n):`, and that loop begins by generating the number **0**.

## The Journey of `i` (The Outer Loop)

The line `for i in range(n):` is what gives `i` its value. Let's see how:

1. First, `n` becomes `5` because that's the length of our array.
2. The code becomes `for i in range(5):`.
3. The `range(5)` command in Python produces a sequence of numbers: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4**.
4. The `for` loop takes the **first number** from that sequence and puts it into `i`. That first number is always **0**.

On the next round, `i` will become 1, then 2 on the round after that, and so on. But it always _starts_ its journey at 0.

## Why `range(n)` is the Perfect Tool

You are also exactly right about _why_ it starts at 0. It's to match the array's indexes.

Let's look at our array:

- **Our array:** `[8, 2, 0, 1, 5]`
- **Its length `n` is:** `5`
- **Its index positions are:** `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`

Now let's look at what `range(n)` (which is `range(5)`) produces:

- **The numbers from `range(5)` are:** `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`

They match perfectly! This is why `for i in range(n):` is the standard way to create a loop that needs to do something for every single position in an array, starting from the beginning.

Yes, that's a great question that gets to the very heart of the Selection Sort strategy.

That line tells the "scanner" part of the algorithm exactly which portion of the list to search. It starts searching **one spot after** the already-sorted section (`i + 1`) and continues **all the way to the end** of the list (`n`).

## The Starting Point: `i + 1` (Don't Check Sorted Cards)

Remember, the variable `i` is the "wall" between the sorted part on the left and the unsorted part on the right.

After we finish Round 1 (when `i` is `0`), we have found the absolute smallest number and placed it perfectly at index `0`. That number is now **locked** and sorted.

When we begin Round 2 (when `i` is `1`), do we need to include the number at index `0` in our search for the _next_ smallest number? No! We already know it's sorted.

The **`i + 1`** tells our scanner loop:

> **"Start your search one position to the right of the `i` you are on. Don't waste time looking at the cards that are already sorted."**

- When `i` is `0`, the inner loop starts searching from index **1**.
- When `i` is `1`, the inner loop starts searching from index **2**.

---

## The Stopping Point: `n` (Check All Unsorted Cards)

The goal of the inner loop is to find the absolute smallest number in the **entire unsorted section**.

To guarantee it finds the smallest one, it must look at every single card from its starting point (`i + 1`) all the way to the very last card in the list.

- We know `n` is the total length of the list (e.g., 5).
- The last index of the list is always `n - 1` (e.g., 4).
- Using `n` as the stopping point in `range(start, n)` tells Python to generate numbers up to (but not including) `n`. This makes sure it includes the very last index.

So, `n` is used here to make sure our scanner **checks every single card** in the unsorted part of the list.
