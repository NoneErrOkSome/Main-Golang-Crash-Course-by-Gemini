Of course. It's a great idea to have a detailed note for your first sorting algorithm.

Here is the note for **01 - Bubble Sort.md**, created from all the details of our conversation.

# Bubble Sort ğŸ«§

**Bubble Sort** is a simple [[What is Sorting]] algorithm.

Its main idea is to repeatedly step through the list, compare side-by-side **neighbors**, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. It keeps doing this until the list is perfectly sorted.

## The "Lining Up Toys" Analogy

Imagine you have a line of toys of different sizes that you want to sort from smallest to biggest.

The rule of the Bubble Sort game is: **You can only compare two toys that are standing right next to each other.**

1. You start at the beginning of the line and compare the first two toys. If the taller one is on the left, you swap them.
2. You move one step to the right and compare the second and third toys. Again, you swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. You continue this until you reach the end of the line.

After one full pass down the line, the **biggest toy will have "bubbled up"** to its correct spot at the very end! You then repeat the whole process, but you can ignore the last (already sorted) toy.

## Big O Rating

Bubble Sort has a worst-case "slowness rating" of [[O(n^2) - Very Very Slow]].

This is because it uses a loop inside another loop. The outer loop (`i`) runs about `n` times, and for each of those times, the inner loop (`j`) _also_ has to do about `n` comparisons. This pattern of doing `n` work `n` times gives us the `n * n` rating.

## The Python Code

This is the standard way to write Bubble Sort in Python.

Python

```Python
# Our messy list of numbers
numbers = [8, 2, 0, 1, 5]

# n holds the total count of numbers
n = len(numbers)

# The outer loop 'i' controls the number of rounds we need to do.
# It makes sure we repeat the process enough times.
for i in range(n):

    # The inner loop 'j' is the worker that walks down the list
    # comparing neighbors in each round.
    # The "n - i - 1" part makes its path shorter in every round.
    for j in range(0, n - i - 1):

        # Here we compare two side-by-side numbers.
        # Is the number on the left bigger than the number on the right?
        if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:

            # If yes, we do the magic swap!
            numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]

# Finally, we print the sorted list.
print(numbers)
```
