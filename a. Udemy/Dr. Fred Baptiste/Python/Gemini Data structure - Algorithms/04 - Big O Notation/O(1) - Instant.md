Of course. Let's create the detailed note for the fastest Big O rating we've discussed.

Here is the note for **O(1) - Instant.md**, based on our conversation.

# O(1) - Instant ‚ö°

The **O(1)** rating is the "slowness rating" for an action that takes the same, constant amount of time no matter how much data you have. It is also called **Constant Time**.

This is the **fastest and best possible rating** an algorithm or action can have. It is one of the ratings described in [[What is Big O (The Slowness Rating)]].

## The "Magic Answer Book" Analogy

The easiest way to understand `O(1)` is to imagine you have a magic book.

No matter what question you ask it ("What is the 5th word in the dictionary?" or "What is the 5 millionth word?"), the book gives you the answer **instantly**, in one single step. The size of the dictionary (`n`) has no effect on the time it takes to get the answer.

This is exactly what `O(1)` feels like. The number of items does not change the time it takes to do the work.

## What O(1) Looks Like

If we were to draw `O(1)` on a chart, it would be a **flat, horizontal line**.

This shows that as the "Number of Items" on the bottom gets bigger, the "Time / Work" on the side does not go up at all. It stays constant.

```
Time / Work ‚è∞
   |
   |
   |___________ (a flat line)
   |
   |___________________________
        Number of Items üìö
```

## Examples of O(1) Actions

Here are some of the instant actions we have already learned about:

`Getting an item from an` [[01 - Array - The Line of Boxes]] `by its index.`
The computer can jump directly to my_list[3] without looking at any other items.

`Adding an item to the end of a list with .append()`
A new person just joins the back of the line, and nobody else has to move.

`Removing an item from the end of a list with .pop()`
The last person in line just leaves, and nobody else has to move.

`Pushing to or Popping from a` [[01 - Stack - The Pile of Plates (LIFO)]]
You only ever touch the single item that is on top.
