Of course. This note will bring together all the key ideas we've discussed about Big O.

Here is the note for **What is Big O (The Slowness Rating).md**.

# What is Big O (The Slowness Rating) ⏱️

**Big O Notation** is the system programmers use to give a "slowness rating" to a Data Structure action or an Algorithm.

It doesn't tell you the exact time in seconds. Instead, it tells you **how much slower** an algorithm will get as you give it more and more data to work with. It helps us compare different plans to see which one is more efficient.

## It Describes the Worst Case

The first important rule is that the Big O rating is always based on the **worst-case scenario**.

We rate an algorithm based on how it performs during its hardest possible job, not its easiest one. This gives us a reliable guarantee of how slow it could possibly be.

To understand this better, see the note:

[[Why We Rate by the Worst Case]]

## It's a "Growth Recipe," Not a Step Counter

The second important rule is that a Big O rating like `O(n)` is a **label for a pattern**, not a calculator for the exact number of steps.

We **never** say an algorithm is "O(5)" or "O(25)". The name tag like `O(n)` or `O(n²)` is permanent.

We use that name tag to predict the work. For example, if an algorithm is `O(n)` and we have `n=5` items, we can predict the work will be around 5 steps.

This also helps us understand the answer to:

## The Main Ratings We've Learned

Here are the main "name tags" we have learned, ranked from fastest to slowest. Each one has its own note explaining it in more detail.

[[O(1) - Instant]]

[[O(log n) - Excellent]]

[[O(n) - Slow (Linear)]]

[[O(n^2) - Very Very Slow]]
