Of course. This is the final note to complete your collection on the main ideas of Big O.

Here is the note for **Is Big O the Same in All Languages.md**.

# Is Big O the Same in All Languages? üë®‚Äçüç≥

The simple and direct answer is: **Yes, the Big O rating of an algorithm is the same no matter what programming language you use.**

An [[O(n^2) - Very Very Slow]] algorithm is always `O(n¬≤)`, whether it's written in Python, Java, or C++. This is a key idea in our understanding of [[What is Big O (The Slowness Rating)]].

## The "Recipe vs. The Chef" Analogy

The best way to understand this is to think of an algorithm as a recipe and the programming language as a chef.

The Recipe is the Algorithm

The recipe is the set of steps to follow. Its complexity is part of the recipe itself. For example, a step might say, "for every egg, stir 50 times."

The Chef is the Programming Language

Different chefs (languages) can follow the same recipe. Some chefs are super fast and efficient (like C++). Other chefs are very clear and easy to understand, but might work at a more careful pace (like Python).

### The Result

Even if the fast chef finishes in 30 minutes and the other chef takes 50 minutes, they **both** followed the same number of steps in the recipe. The **actual time** changed, but the **recipe's complexity (the Big O) did not**.

Big O describes the number of steps in the recipe, not the number of minutes it takes the chef to do it.

## The "Different Tools" Detail

The only time this seems different is when languages offer different built-in tools (Data Structures).

For example, removing an item from the front of a standard [[01 - Array - The Line of Boxes]] is slow (`O(n)`) because everyone has to shuffle forward.

Another language might offer a special "magic train" data structure (called a `LinkedList`) where removing the front car is instant (`O(1)`).

This isn't the language changing Big O. It's the programmer choosing a **different tool** that has a different Big O rating for its actions. The rating for "removing from the front of an array" is always `O(n)`, no matter which language (chef) is doing the work.
