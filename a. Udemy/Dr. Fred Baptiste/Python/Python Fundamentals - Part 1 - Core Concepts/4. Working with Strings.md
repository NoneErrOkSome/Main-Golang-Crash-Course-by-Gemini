Of course. Here is an in-depth document on working with strings in Python, based on the course structure we've developed.

## Python Fundamentals: Working with Strings ðŸ“œ

Strings are one of the most fundamental and widely used data types in Python. They are sequences of Unicode characters used to represent text. Python provides a rich set of tools for creating, manipulating, and formatting strings.

### String Immutability

A core characteristic of Python strings is that they are **immutable**. This means that once a string object is created, its contents cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to "modify" a string, such as replacing a character or converting it to uppercase, will actually create and return a **new** string, leaving the original unchanged.

Python

```Python
my_string = "hello"

# This will cause an error because strings are immutable
# my_string[0] = "H"  # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

# To "change" the string, you must create a new one
new_string = "H" + my_string[1:]
print(f"Original string: {my_string}")
print(f"New string: {new_string}")
```

**Output:**

```Python
Original string: hello
New string: Hello
```

### Basic String Operations

You can perform basic operations like concatenation and repetition on strings.

- **Concatenation (`+`)**: Joins two or more strings together to create a new string.
- **Repetition (`*`)**: Creates a new string by repeating an existing string a specified number of times.

Python

```Python
first_name = "Alex"
last_name = "Smith"

# Concatenation
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: Alex Smith

# Repetition
separator = "-" * 10
print(separator)  # Output: ----------
```

### Indexing and Slicing

Since strings are sequences, you can access their individual parts using indexing and slicing.

#### Indexing

You can access a single character using its **0-based index** in square brackets `[]`. Negative indices count from the end of the string.

Python

```Python
word = "Python"
# P  y  t  h  o  n
# 0  1  2  3  4  5
#-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1

print(f"First character (index 0): {word[0]}")   # P
print(f"Third character (index 2): {word[2]}")   # t
print(f"Last character (index -1): {word[-1]}")  # n
```

#### Slicing

Slicing extracts a substring (a portion of the string) and returns it as a new string.

**Syntax:** `my_string[start:stop:step]`

- **`start`**: The starting index (inclusive). Defaults to `0`.
- **`stop`**: The ending index (exclusive). Defaults to the end of the string.
- **`step`**: The increment size. Defaults to `1`.

Python

```Python
phrase = "Hello, World!"

# Get a slice from index 7 up to (but not including) 12
print(phrase[7:12])   # World

# Get a slice from the beginning
print(phrase[:5])     # Hello

# Get a slice to the end
print(phrase[7:])     # World!

# Create a full copy
print(phrase[:])      # Hello, World!

# Get every second character
print(phrase[::2])    # Hlo ol!
```

### Common String Methods

String methods perform operations on strings and **return new strings** (due to immutability).

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Method**|**Description**|**Example**|
|`upper()` / `lower()`|Returns a new string converted to uppercase or lowercase.|`'Py'.lower()` returns `'py'`|
|`strip()` / `lstrip()` / `rstrip()`|Returns a new string with leading/trailing whitespace removed.|`' Hi '.strip()` returns `'Hi'`|
|`startswith(prefix)`|Returns `True` if the string starts with the specified prefix.|`'Python'.startswith('Py')` returns `True`|
|`endswith(suffix)`|Returns `True` if the string ends with the specified suffix.|`'image.png'.endswith('.png')` returns `True`|
|`find(sub)`|Returns the lowest index of the substring `sub`. Returns `-1` if not found.|`'hello'.find('ll')` returns `2`|
|`replace(old, new, count)`|Returns a new string where `old` substrings are replaced with `new`. `count` is an optional limit.|`'hi hi'.replace('i', 'o')` returns `'ho ho'`|
|`split(separator)`|Returns a list of substrings split by the `separator`. If no separator is given, splits by whitespace.|`'a,b,c'.split(',')` returns `['a', 'b', 'c']`|
|`join(iterable)`|Returns a string by joining all items in an iterable (like a list) with the string as the separator.|`'-'.join(['a','b','c'])` returns `'a-b-c'`|

Python

```Python
message = "  Welcome to Python Programming!  "

# Case conversion
print(f"UPPER: {message.upper()}")
print(f"lower: {message.lower()}")

# Whitespace removal
print(f"strip: '{message.strip()}'")

# Checking and finding
print(f"Starts with 'Welcome': {message.strip().startswith('Welcome')}")
print(f"Find 'Python': {message.find('Python')}")

# Replacing
print(f"Replaced: {message.replace('Python', 'Go')}")

# Splitting and Joining
words = message.strip().split(" ")
print(f"Split into words: {words}")
joined_words = "---".join(words)
print(f"Joined words: {joined_words}")
```

### String Formatting

String formatting is used to create strings by embedding variables or expressions within them.

#### f-strings (Formatted String Literals) - Preferred Method

This is the modern, concise, and most readable way to format strings in Python (version 3.6+). You prefix the string with an `f` and place variables or expressions directly inside curly braces `{}`.

Python

```Python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
pi = 3.14159

# Basic f-string usage
greeting = f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(greeting)

# f-strings can include expressions
print(f"Next year, I will be {age + 1} years old.")

# f-strings allow for formatting options
print(f"The value of pi is approximately {pi:.2f}.") # Format to 2 decimal places
```

**Output:**

```Python
Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
Next year, I will be 31 years old.
The value of pi is approximately 3.14.
```

#### `.format()` Method

This is an older but still widely used method for string formatting. It uses curly braces `{}` as placeholders, which are then filled by the arguments passed to the `.format()` method.

Python

```Python
name = "Bob"
age = 25

# Positional formatting
message1 = "User {}, age {}.".format(name, age)
print(message1)

# Keyword formatting
message2 = "User {user_name}, age {user_age}.".format(user_name=name, user_age=age)
print(message2)
```

**Output:**

```Python
User Bob, age 25.
User Bob, age Bob.
```

While `.format()` is still functional, **f-strings are generally recommended for new code** due to their improved readability and performance.
