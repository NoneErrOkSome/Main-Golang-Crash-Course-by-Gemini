Okay, here's a brief document on `while` loops in Python, based on the Python fundamentals structure.

## Python Fundamentals: Control Flow - `while` Loops ðŸ”„

The **`while` loop** in Python is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified1 boolean condition remains `True`.

---

### 1. What is a `while` Loop?

- **Condition-Based Iteration:** Unlike `for` loops that typically iterate over a sequence, `while` loops continue executing as long as their defined condition holds `True`.
- **Flexibility:** Useful when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand, but depends on a condition being met or a state changing.
- **Manual Updates:** You often need to manually update variables within the loop that affect the loop's condition to eventually make it `False` and terminate the loop.

---

### 2. Syntax

The basic syntax of a `while` loop is:

Python

```Python
while condition:
    # block of code to execute
    # (statements in this block are indented)
    # (typically, something in this block should eventually make the condition false)
```

- `condition`: A boolean expression. The loop body executes if this is `True`. It's checked _before_ each iteration.
- `block of code`: One or more statements, indented, that are executed in each iteration.

### 3. Basic Usage

Python

```Python
# Example 1: Counting up
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1  # Crucial: update the variable affecting the condition

print("Loop finished. Final count:", count)

# Example 2: Waiting for a specific input
user_input = ""
while user_input.lower() != "quit":
    user_input = input("Enter something (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")

print("Exited the input loop.")
```

**Output (for Example 1):**

```Python
Count is: 0
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Loop finished. Final count: 5
```

**Example Interaction (for Example 2):**

```Python
Enter something (or 'quit' to exit): hello
You entered: hello
Enter something (or 'quit' to exit): world
You entered: world
Enter something (or 'quit' to exit): quit
You entered: quit
Exited the input loop.
```

### 4. Loop Control Statements with `while`

`break` and `continue` work with `while` loops just as they do with `for` loops.

- **`break`**: Immediately exits the `while` loop.
- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps back to check the `while` loop's condition again.

Python

```Python
# Example with break and continue
num = 0
while num < 10:
    num += 1
    if num == 3:
        print("Skipping 3 with continue")
        continue  # Skip print(num) for num=3
    if num == 7:
        print("Breaking at 7")
        break     # Exit the loop when num is 7
    print(f"Current number: {num}")

print("Loop ended. Final num:", num)
```

**Output:**

```Python
Current number: 1
Current number: 2
Skipping 3 with continue
Current number: 4
Current number: 5
Current number: 6
Breaking at 7
Loop ended. Final num: 7
```

---

### 5. The `else` Clause in `while` Loops

Python's `while` loops (and `for` loops) can have an optional **`else` clause**. The `else` block is executed if the loop terminates **normally** (i.e., its condition becomes `False`), but **not** if the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.

Python

```Python
attempts = 3
while attempts > 0:
    password = input(f"Enter password ({attempts} attempts left): ")
    if password == "secret":
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    attempts -= 1
    print("Incorrect password.")
else: # Executed only if the loop condition (attempts > 0) becomes false
    print("Access denied. No attempts left.")

print("Login process finished.")
```

**Example Interaction (successful):**

```Python
Enter password (3 attempts left): wrong
Incorrect password.
Enter password (2 attempts left): secret
Access granted!
Login process finished.
```

**Example Interaction (failed):**

```Python
Enter password (3 attempts left): no
Incorrect password.
Enter password (2 attempts left): nope
Incorrect password.
Enter password (1 attempts left): nada
Incorrect password.
Access denied. No attempts left.
Login process finished.
```

### 6. Infinite `while` Loops

You can create an infinite loop by using `while True`:

Python

```Python
# while True:
#     print("This will run forever unless broken!")
#     # Usually, there's an if condition inside with a break statement
#     user_command = input("Command: ")
#     if user_command == "exit":
#         break
```

Infinite loops are useful for applications that need to run continuously (e.g., servers, event listeners) until explicitly told to stop.

---

### Summary

- `while` loops execute a block of code as long as a specified boolean `condition` is `True`.
- The condition is checked _before_ each iteration.
- It's crucial to ensure the condition will eventually become `False`, or to use `break` to exit, to avoid infinite loops (unless an infinite loop is intended).
- `break` and `continue` can be used to control the loop's execution.
- An optional `else` clause can be used, which executes if the loop terminates normally (not via `break`).

`while` loops provide a flexible way to handle iteration when the number of repetitions isn't fixed but depends on a dynamic condition.
