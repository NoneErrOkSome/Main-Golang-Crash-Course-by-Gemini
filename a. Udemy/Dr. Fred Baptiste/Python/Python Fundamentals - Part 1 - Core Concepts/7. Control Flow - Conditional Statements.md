## Control Flow: Conditional Statements in Python ðŸ¤”

Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming that allow a program to make decisions. They control the flow of execution by running specific blocks of code only if certain conditions are met. In Python, this is primarily achieved using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

---

### The `if` Statement

The `if` statement is the simplest conditional statement. 1 It executes a block of code only when its associated condition evaluates to `True`.

**Syntax:**

Python

```Python
if condition:
    # Indented block of code to execute
    # if the condition is True
```

**Example:**

Python

```Python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")

# This message prints regardless of the condition
print("Finished checking eligibility.")
```

**Output:**

```Python
You are eligible to vote.
Finished checking eligibility.
```

### The `if...else` Statement

The `if...else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the `if` condition evaluates to `False`. 2

**Syntax:**

Python

```Python
if condition:
    # Block to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Block to execute if condition is False
```

**Example:**

Python

```Python
temperature = 15
if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a hot day! Wear something light.")
else:
    print("It's not too hot. You might need a jacket.")
```

**Output:**

```Python
It's not too hot. You might need a jacket.
```

### The `if...elif...else` Chain

The `if...elif...else` chain is used to check multiple, mutually exclusive conditions in sequence. 3 `elif` is short for "else if."

- Python evaluates the conditions from top to bottom.
- As soon as a condition is found to be `True`, its corresponding block is executed, and the rest of the chain is skipped.
- The final `else` block is optional and runs if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`.

**Syntax:**

Python

```Python
if condition1:
    # Block for condition1
elif condition2:
    # Block for condition2
else:
    # Block if no other conditions are met
```

**Example:**

Python

```Python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "D or F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

**Output:**

```Python
Your grade is: B
```

### Nested `if` Statements

You can place conditional statements inside other conditional statements. 4 This is called nesting and is used to check for secondary conditions after a primary condition is met.

Python

```Python
age = 22
has_ticket = True

if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to enter.")
    if has_ticket:
        print("Welcome! Enjoy the show.")
    else:
        print("You must have a ticket to enter.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are not old enough to enter.")
```

**Output:**

```Python
You are old enough to enter.
Welcome! Enjoy the show.
```

### Boolean Logic and Truthiness/Falsiness in Conditions

Conditions in Python are not limited to simple comparisons; they can be complex boolean expressions built using logical operators. Python also has a unique concept of "truthiness" and "falsiness" that allows for more concise code. 5

#### Logical Operators

- `and`: Returns `True` if both operands are true.
- `or`: Returns `True` if at least one operand is true.
- `not`: Inverts the boolean value (`True` becomes `False`, `False` becomes `True`). 6
    

Both `and` and `or` use **short-circuit evaluation**. 7

- For `and`, if the first operand is `False`, the second is not evaluated.
- For `or`, if the first operand is `True`, the second is not evaluated.

**Example:**

Python

```Python
age = 25
is_citizen = True

if age >= 18 and is_citizen:
    print("You are eligible to vote in the national election.")

if not is_citizen:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

**Output:**

```
You are eligible to vote in the national election.
```

#### Truthiness and Falsiness

In a boolean context (like an `if` condition), Python considers certain values to be implicitly `False`. These are called **"falsy"** values. All other values are considered **"truthy"**. 8

The main **falsy** values are:

- The boolean `False`
- The special value `None`
- Zero of any numeric type (e.g., `0`, `0.0`)
- Any empty sequence (e.g., an empty string `""`, an empty list `[]`, an empty tuple `()`)
- Any empty mapping (e.g., an empty dictionary `{}`) 9
    

This allows you to write concise checks without explicit comparisons.

**Example:**

Python

```Python
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

if name: # This checks if the string 'name' is NOT empty (i.e., it's truthy)
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
else: # This runs if 'name' is an empty string "" (which is falsy)
    print("You did not enter a name.")

my_list = []
if my_list: # This is False because the list is empty
    print("The list has items.")
else:
    print("The list is empty.")
```

**Example Interaction:**

```Python
Please enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!
The list is empty.
```
