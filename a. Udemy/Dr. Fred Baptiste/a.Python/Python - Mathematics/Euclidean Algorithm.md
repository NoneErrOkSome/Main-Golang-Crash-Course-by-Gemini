Sure, I'd be happy to show you how to implement the Euclidean Algorithm in Python. This algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

Here's how it works:

1. The function accepts two arguments `a` and `b`, which are the two numbers for which you want to find the GCD.
2. The `while` loop runs as long as `b` is not equal to zero.
3. Inside the loop, `b` is set to the remainder of the division of `a` by `b` using the modulus operator (`%`), and `a` is set to the old value of `b`. 
4. Once `b` becomes zero, the loop stops and `a` is returned, which at this point is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

Let's put the function to use:

```python
print(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6
```

In this example, 6 is the greatest common divisor of 48 and 18.
