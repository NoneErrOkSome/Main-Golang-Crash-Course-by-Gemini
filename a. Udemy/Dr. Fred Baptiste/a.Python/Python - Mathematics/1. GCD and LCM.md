In Python, you can use the built-in math library which contains `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) function. For the Least Common Multiple (LCM), there isn't a built-in function, but you can calculate it using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)`.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)

# Testing
print("GCD of 48 and 18 is: ", gcd(48, 18))
print("LCM of 48 and 18 is: ", lcm(48, 18))
```

In this code:

- The `gcd` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor using Python's built-in `math.gcd` function.
- The `lcm` function also takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their least common multiple. The least common multiple is calculated by taking the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b`, and dividing it by their greatest common divisor.

Running the script should give you:

```
GCD of 48 and 18 is:  6
LCM of 48 and 18 is:  144
```

So, the GCD of 48 and 18 is 6, and their LCM is 144.
