In Python, properties are a way to control access to an attribute of a class, allowing you to use methods (getters and setters) to get and set the value of an attribute, while still accessing it like a normal attribute. This means you can use the dot notation (`obj.attr`) to get or set the value, while in the background Python calls a method.

Here's an example:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        if value >= 0:
            self._radius = value
        else:
            raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")
```

In this `Circle` class, `_radius` is a private attribute. The `radius` property is used to control access to `_radius`.

The `radius` method decorated with `@property` is a getter for `_radius`. It allows you to get the value of `_radius` with `c.radius`.

The `radius` method decorated with `@radius.setter` is a setter for `_radius`. It allows you to set the value of `_radius` with `c.radius = value`. In this case, it also checks that the value is not negative before setting `_radius`.

Here's how you can use this class:

```python
c = Circle(5)
print(c.radius)  # Output: 5

c.radius = 10
print(c.radius)  # Output: 10

try:
    c.radius = -5  # This will raise a ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Radius cannot be negative
```

As you can see, you can use `c.radius` to get or set the value of `_radius`, just like a normal attribute, but behind the scenes Python is calling the getter and setter methods. This is the power of properties in Python. They allow you to control how attributes are accessed and modified, while still keeping the interface simple and intuitive.
