When you create an instance of a class in Python, the class's `__init__` method is called. This is where you can set the initial state of the object. The `__init__` method is Python's version of what is known as a constructor in other programming languages.

Here's an example of how you could use the `__init__` method in a class:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

In the `Person` class above, the `__init__` method takes two arguments (besides the required `self`): `name` and `age`. These are used to set the `name` and `age` attributes on instances of the `Person` class.

Here's how you could create an instance of the `Person` class:

```python
p = Person("Alice", 30)
```

Now `p` is an instance of `Person`, with `name` set to `"Alice"` and `age` set to `30`. You can access these attributes like this:

```python
print(p.name)  # Output: Alice
print(p.age)   # Output: 30
```

It's important to note that `self` is the first parameter in the `__init__` method (and in any other method of a class). `self` is a reference to the instance of the class, and it's how you can access attributes and methods on the instance.

The `__init__` method doesn't return anything; it only initializes the attributes of the class. The `__new__` method is called to create a new instance, and then `__init__` is called to initialize it. This is all done automatically when you call `Person("Alice", 30)`.
