Instance methods are functions that are defined inside a class and can only be called from an instance of that class. They are accessible through the instance of the class.

Instance methods must have `self` as the first parameter, which refers to the instance calling the method. Through the `self` keyword, instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods on the same object. This gives them a lot of power when it comes to modifying an object's state.

Here's an example of a class with an instance method:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")
```

In the `Dog` class above, `bark` is an instance method. This method takes one parameter, `self`, which refers to the instance of the class. When `bark` is called, it prints a message including the name of the dog.

Here's how you can use this instance method:

```python
d = Dog("Fido", 3)
d.bark()  # Output: Fido says woof!
```

In this example, `d` is an instance of the `Dog` class, and you can call the `bark` instance method on `d`.

As you can see, instance methods are an important part of Python's object-oriented programming model. They give you a way to specify behaviors that are specific to objects of a particular class.
