Exceptions are errors detected during execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python generates an exception that can be handled, which avoids your program to crash.

You can also raise exceptions in your own code, causing your program to halt if certain conditions are not met, or if you want to indicate that an error occurred.

To raise an exception, you can use the `raise` statement, followed by the name of the exception you wish to raise. Most exceptions are derived from the built-in `Exception` class. You can raise a built-in exception or a custom one, as long as it's derived from `Exception`.

Here's an example where we raise a built-in exception:

```python
def greet(name):
    if not isinstance(name, str):
        raise TypeError("name must be a string")
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

greet(123)  # This will raise the TypeError
```

In the example above, if `name` is not a string, the `greet` function raises a `TypeError`. When this line of code is executed, Python will stop the program and print an error message.

If you want to create a new type of exception, you can do so by defining a new class that inherits from `Exception` or one of its subclasses:

```python
class MyCustomException(Exception):
    pass

def greet(name):
    if not isinstance(name, str):
        raise MyCustomException("name must be a string")
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

greet(123)  # This will raise MyCustomException
```

In this example, `MyCustomException` is defined and then raised in the `greet` function when `name` is not a string.

Exceptions are a key aspect of handling errors in Python and they give you the control over your program's flow and the ability to generate errors when necessary.

Rust, just like Python, also has error handling mechanisms, but the approach is a little different compared to Python. Instead of exceptions, Rust has the concepts of `Result` and `Option` for explicit error handling, and the `panic!` macro for unrecoverable errors.

Let's say you want to write a function that greets the user, but should stop execution when the name provided isn't a valid string (an empty string in this case). This can be done by creating a custom error type, and returning a `Result` from your function.

Here's a simple example:

```rust
// We define a custom error type.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NameError(String);

// `greet` returns a `Result` that is either `()` or a `NameError`.
fn greet(name: &str) -> Result<(), NameError> {
    if name.is_empty() {
        // If `name` is an empty string, we return an error.
        Err(NameError(String::from("Name must not be an empty string")))
    } else {
        // If `name` is non-empty, we print the greeting and return `Ok`.
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() {
    match greet("") {
        Ok(_) => {}
        Err(e) => eprintln!("An error occurred: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

In this example, we've defined a custom error type `NameError` that we use to indicate that an invalid name was passed to the `greet` function. The `greet` function returns a `Result`. If the name is valid (non-empty), it prints a greeting and returns `Ok(())`. If the name is invalid (empty), it returns `Err(NameError(...))`.

In the `main` function, we call `greet` and handle the `Result` using a `match` statement. If an `Ok` value is returned, we do nothing. If an `Err` value is returned, we print the error.

The Rust way of handling errors is a bit more explicit compared to Python's exceptions. Instead of "ask for forgiveness", Rust goes by "look before you leap". This means that instead of catching exceptions after they've happened, you're expected to handle potential errors where they might occur. This can make the code more robust and easier to reason about, as all possible error cases are handled explicitly.
