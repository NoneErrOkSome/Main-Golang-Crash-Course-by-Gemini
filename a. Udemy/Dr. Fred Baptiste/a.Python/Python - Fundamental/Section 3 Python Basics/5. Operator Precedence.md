Operator precedence, also known as order of operations, determines how operators are parsed in relation to each other. It's essentially a set of rules that dictate the sequence in which operations are performed in an expression.

In Python, the order of operations (from highest to lowest precedence) is as follows:

1. **Parentheses** (`()`): Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first. This can be used to override the normal precedence rules.

   ```python
   result = (1 + 2) * 3  # result is 9
   ```

2. **Exponentiation** (`**`): The exponentiation operator has the second highest precedence.

   ```python
   result = 2 ** 3  # result is 8
   ```

3. **Unary negation** (`-`): This is the negation of a single operand.

   ```python
   result = -3  # result is -3
   ```

4. **Multiplication, division, and modulus** (`*`, `/`, `//`, `%`): These operators all have the same level of precedence.

   ```python
   result = 2 * 3  # result is 6
   result = 10 / 5  # result is 2.0
   result = 10 // 3  # result is 3
   result = 10 % 3  # result is 1
   ```

5. **Addition and subtraction** (`+`, `-`): These operators have the lowest precedence.

   ```python
   result = 2 + 3  # result is 5
   result = 5 - 2  # result is 3
   ```

When operators have the same level of precedence, the order of evaluation is from left to right.

```python
result = 2 * 3 / 2  # result is 3.0, not 1.0
```

In the above example, `2 * 3` is evaluated first, then the result is divided by `2`.
