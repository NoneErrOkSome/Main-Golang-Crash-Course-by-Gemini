Comparison operators in Python are used to compare values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.

Here are the comparison operators in Python:

**1. Equals (`==`)**: Returns `True` if the values of the two operands are equal, `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x == y)  # prints: False
```

**2. Not equals (`!=`)**: Returns `True` if the values of the two operands are not equal, `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x != y)  # prints: True
```

**3. Greater than (`>`)**: Returns `True` if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x > y)  # prints: True
```

**4. Less than (`<`)**: Returns `True` if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x < y)  # prints: False
```

**5. Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Returns `True` if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 5
y = 5
print(x >= y)  # prints: True
```

**6. Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Returns `True` if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 5
y = 6
print(x <= y)  # prints: True
```

These comparison operators can be used with all types of variables like int, float, string etc. They are commonly used in control flow statements, like if and while loops.
