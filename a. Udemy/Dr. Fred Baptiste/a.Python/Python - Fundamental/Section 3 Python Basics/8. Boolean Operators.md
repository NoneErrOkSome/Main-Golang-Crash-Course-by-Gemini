Boolean operators in Python evaluate expressions to return values of the Boolean data type: `True` or `False`. These operators are crucial for creating more complex conditional statements. There are three Boolean operators in Python: `and`, `or`, and `not`.

1. **`and`**: This operator returns `True` if both of its operands are `True`. If either or both operands are `False`, it returns `False`.

```python
x = True
y = False

print(x and y)  # prints: False
```

2. **`or`**: This operator returns `True` if at least one of its operands is `True`. It only returns `False` if both operands are `False`.

```python
x = True
y = False

print(x or y)  # prints: True
```

3. **`not`**: This is a unary operator, meaning it only operates on a single operand. It returns `True` if the operand is `False`, and `False` if the operand is `True`. In other words, it inverts the Boolean value of its operand.

```python
x = True

print(not x)  # prints: False
```

These operators can be combined to form more complex logical conditions. For instance, `x and not y` is `True` if `x` is `True` and `y` is `False`. 

Keep in mind that Python follows the short-circuit rule with Boolean operators, meaning that it stops evaluating as soon as it finds the first instance that determines the final value. For `and` operations, if the first value is `False`, it doesn't bother checking the second value because it already knows the result will be `False`. For `or` operations, if the first value is `True`, it doesn't check the second value because the result is already determined to be `True`.
