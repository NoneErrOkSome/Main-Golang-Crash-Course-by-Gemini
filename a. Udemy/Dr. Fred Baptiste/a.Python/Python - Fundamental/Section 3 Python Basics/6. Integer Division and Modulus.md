The integer division and modulus operations are two related operations that you'll find in many programming languages, including Python.

**Integer Division (`//`)**: The integer division operation divides the first operand by the second operand and rounds down to the nearest integer. 

```python
x = 17
y = 5
result = x // y
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

In the example above, 17 divided by 5 is 3.4. When we round down to the nearest integer, we get 3.

**Modulus (`%`)**: The modulus operation gives the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second operand.

```python
x = 17
y = 5
result = x % y
print(result)  # prints: 2
```

In the example above, 17 divided by 5 is 3 remainder 2. The modulus operation gives us this remainder.

These two operations are often used together when you want to divide integers and get both the quotient and the remainder. For example, you might use them to convert a number of minutes into hours and minutes. 

Here's an example:

```python
minutes = 123
hours = minutes // 60
remaining_minutes = minutes % 60
print(f'{hours} hour(s) and {remaining_minutes} minute(s)')  # prints: 2 hour(s) and 3 minute(s)
```

In the example above, 123 minutes is equal to 2 hours and 3 minutes. We use integer division to get the number of hours and the modulus operation to get the remaining number of minutes.
