A variable in Python is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable is a name that refers to a value.

Here's how you can create variables in Python:

```python
x = 10
y = "Hello, World!"
z = 3.14
```

In this code, `x`, `y`, and `z` are variables. The variable `x` refers to the integer 10, `y` refers to the string "Hello, World!", and `z` refers to the floating point number 3.14.

Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to specify the type of the variable when you declare it.

Variable names in Python can contain alphanumerical characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and some special characters such as `_`. Normal variable names must start with a letter. By convention, variable names start with a lower-case letter, and Class names start with a capital letter.

You can also assign values to multiple variables in one line:

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```

Here, `a` is assigned `1`, `b` is assigned `2`, and `c` is assigned `3`.

It's also important to note that variables in Python refer to values and not locations in memory as in some other languages. When you do `x = y`, both `x` and `y` refer to the same value, and no copying of the value is done. If you then do `x = z`, `x` stops referring to the value `y` refers to and instead refers to what `z` refers to. `y` is not affected.
