Python supports a variety of arithmetic operations. Here are the basic ones:

**1. Addition (`+`)**: This operator adds two numbers together.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)  # prints: 15
```

**2. Subtraction (`-`)**: This operator subtracts the second number from the first.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)  # prints: 5
```

**3. Multiplication (`*`)**: This operator multiplies two numbers together.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x * y)  # prints: 50
```

**4. Division (`/`)**: This operator divides the first number by the second. The result is a floating point number.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x / y)  # prints: 2.0
```

**5. Integer Division (`//`)**: This operator divides the first number by the second and rounds down to the nearest integer.

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x // y)  # prints: 3
```

**6. Modulus (`%`)**: This operator gives the remainder of the first number divided by the second.

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x % y)  # prints: 1
```

**7. Exponentiation (`**`)**: This operator raises the first number to the power of the second.

```python
x = 10
y = 2
print(x ** y)  # prints: 100
```

**8. Negation (`-`)**: This operator negates a number.

```python
x = 10
print(-x)  # prints: -10
```

Python also supports augmented assignment operators, like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc., which combine an arithmetic operation with assignment. For example, `x += 5` is equivalent to `x = x + 5`.
