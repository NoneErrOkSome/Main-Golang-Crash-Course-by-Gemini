Decorators in Python are a very powerful and useful tool that allow you to alter the behavior of a function or class. A decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as input and extends or changes its behavior without explicitly modifying it.

Here is a simple example of a decorator:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)
say_hello()
```

When you call `say_hello()`, it's now wrapped by the code in the `wrapper()` function inside the `my_decorator` function.

To make the usage of decorators cleaner, Python uses the `@` symbol, which is placed on the line before the function to be decorated:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

This code does exactly the same thing as the previous one but looks nicer. Instead of `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`, we simply have `@my_decorator` before the `say_hello` function.

Decorators can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but they are a very useful tool once you get used to them. They are widely used in many Python libraries and frameworks. For example, in the Flask web framework, decorators are used to link functions to specific URLs.
