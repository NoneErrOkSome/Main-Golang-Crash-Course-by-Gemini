The `functools.lru_cache` decorator in Python is a powerful feature that allows your program to save the results of previous function calls to improve performance. This technique is called "memoization" or "caching". The term "LRU" stands for "Least Recently Used" - if the cache is full, this is the item that will be discarded first.

The `functools.lru_cache` decorator can be particularly useful when your program involves expensive or I/O bound function calls that are often repeated with the same arguments.

Here's an example:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def expensive_function(x, y):
    # Simulate an expensive or I/O bound operation
    return x * y
```

In this example, `expensive_function` is decorated with `functools.lru_cache`, which means that results of previous calls are saved in a cache. If the function is called again with the same arguments, the decorator will return the saved result, and the function won't actually be executed. This can save a lot of time if the function is expensive to compute or it involves I/O operations such as network or disk access.

The `maxsize` argument to `lru_cache` determines the size of the cache. If this is set to `None`, the cache can grow without bound. If the cache becomes full, the least recently used items will be discarded.

Note that since the cache uses a dictionary internally, all arguments to the function must be hashable for the caching to work. Also, the function should not have side effects, because the decorator will only call it once with each set of arguments, and then return the cached result.
