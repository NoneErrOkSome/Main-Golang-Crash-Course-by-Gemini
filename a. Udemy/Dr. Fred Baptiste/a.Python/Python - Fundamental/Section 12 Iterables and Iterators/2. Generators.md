Generators are a type of iterable in Python, like lists or tuples. Unlike lists, they don't allow indexing, but they can still be iterated through with for loops. They are created using functions and the `yield` keyword.

The main feature of generators is that they are lazy, meaning they generate values on the fly as you need them, instead of storing everything up front. This feature makes generators a very powerful tool when working with large datasets or when creating infinite sequences, because they can be created without fitting the entire object into memory.

Here's an example of a simple generator that generates numbers from 0 up to `n - 1`:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    count = 0
    while count < n:
        yield count
        count += 1

for number in count_up_to(5):
    print(number)
```

When you call a generator function, it doesn't return a single value; instead, it returns a generator object that you can iterate over to retrieve its values.

The `yield` keyword pauses the function and saves its state, so that it can be resumed later from where it left off, allowing it to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

Generator expressions are a high-performance, memoryâ€“efficient generalization of list comprehensions and generators. Here's an example:

```python
numbers = (n for n in range(5))
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

In the example above, `(n for n in range(5))` is a generator expression that creates a generator object.

Note: Once a generator's values have been exhausted, they cannot be iterated over again. If you need to iterate over the sequence again, you'll need to recreate the generator object.

In summary, generators are a powerful tool in Python for creating and working with sequences of items in an efficient way.
