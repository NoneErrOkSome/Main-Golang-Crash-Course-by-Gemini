**Iterables**

In Python, an iterable is an object capable of returning its elements one at a time. Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings are examples of iterable objects.

Python's `for` loop can iterate over the elements of any iterable. Here's an example with a list:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Iterators**

An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data returned one value at a time. This is different from an iterable, where all values can be accessed at once. 

You can create an iterator object by defining a class with a `__iter__()` method, which returns the iterator object (usually `self`), and a `__next__()` method, which returns the next value from the iterator. If there are no more items to return, `__next__()` should raise the `StopIteration` exception.

Here's an example of a simple iterator class:

```python
class CountUpToThree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.count < 3:
            self.count += 1
            return self.count
        else:
            raise StopIteration
```

You can get an iterator from an iterable by using the `iter()` function, and you can get the next value from an iterator by using the `next()` function:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruit_iterator = iter(fruits)

print(next(fruit_iterator))  # output: apple
print(next(fruit_iterator))  # output: banana
print(next(fruit_iterator))  # output: cherry
```

After the iterator has returned all of its data, calling `next()` raises a `StopIteration` exception. In the context of a `for` loop, this exception is automatically caught and used to break out of the loop.

Iterator objects can only be iterated over once. After you've called `next()` until `StopIteration` is raised, you've "exhausted" the iterator, and it won't return any more values.

Python's built-in functions like `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, `all()`, `any()`, etc., can take an iterable as an argument, and they internally make use of an iterator to loop over the elements.

Python's iterator protocol is a powerful feature that allows for efficient looping and the creation of infinite sequences.
