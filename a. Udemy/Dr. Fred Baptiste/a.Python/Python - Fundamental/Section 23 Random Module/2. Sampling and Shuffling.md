The `random` module in Python includes methods for random sampling and shuffling of sequences.

**Sampling**

The `random.sample()` function returns a list of unique elements chosen randomly from the input sequence.

Here is an example:

```python
import random

# a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# sampling without replacement
sample = random.sample(numbers, 5)
print(sample)
```

In this case, `random.sample(numbers, 5)` returns a list of 5 unique elements chosen from the `numbers` list.

Note that the `random.sample()` function performs sampling without replacement, which means that no element appears more than once in the returned sample.

**Shuffling**

The `random.shuffle()` function can be used to shuffle a sequence in place, meaning that it changes the order of elements in the original sequence.

Here is an example:

```python
import random

# a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# shuffle the list
random.shuffle(numbers)
print(numbers)
```

In this case, `random.shuffle(numbers)` shuffles the elements of the `numbers` list.

Remember, these functions modify the order of elements in the sequence randomly, but the sequence of random numbers produced by Python (or any other language, for that matter) is deterministic and can be reproduced if you know the seed value that was used. If you want your code to produce different results each time it's run, you can use `random.seed()` to set a seed value based on the current time, or let Python set a seed when the `random` module is imported.
