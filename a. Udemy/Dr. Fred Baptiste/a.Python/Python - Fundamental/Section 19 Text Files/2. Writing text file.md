Just like in the case of reading a file, decorators can be used to handle certain operations while writing to a file. Here's a simple example:

```python
def handle_exceptions(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    return wrapper

@handle_exceptions
def write_text_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)

# Now, let's try to write to a text file.
write_text_file("my_text_file.txt", "Hello, world!")
```

In this example:

1. The `handle_exceptions` decorator is defined, just like in the previous example. This decorator catches and prints any exceptions that occur when the decorated function is called.

2. The `write_text_file` function is decorated with `@handle_exceptions`. This function opens a file in write mode and writes some content to it.

3. When `write_text_file` is called, if any error occurs (like the file cannot be opened for writing), the error will be caught and a message will be printed.

This way, by using a decorator, you can handle exceptions consistently across multiple functions that perform file operations or any other operations that may raise exceptions. This can help make your code more robust and easier to maintain.

Keep in mind, however, that the `handle_exceptions` decorator used in these examples is very simple and just prints a message when an error occurs. In a real-world scenario, you might want to do something more useful when an exception is caught, like logging the error to a file or retrying the operation.
