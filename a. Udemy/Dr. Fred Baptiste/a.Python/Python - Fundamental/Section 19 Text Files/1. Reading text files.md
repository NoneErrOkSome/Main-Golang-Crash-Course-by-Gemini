There might be a misunderstanding here. While decorators are a very powerful tool in Python, they don't directly relate to reading text files. Decorators are used for modifying or extending the behavior of functions or classes without permanently modifying them.

However, decorators could be used in conjunction with file handling for specific purposes, for example, ensuring a file is closed properly after its content is read. Let's see an example where a decorator can be used to read a file and handle any exceptions that might occur:

```python
def handle_exceptions(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    return wrapper

@handle_exceptions
def read_text_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())

# Now, let's try to read a text file.
read_text_file("my_text_file.txt")
```

In this code:

1. A decorator `handle_exceptions` is defined that takes a function `func` and returns a new function `wrapper`. The `wrapper` function executes `func` and handles any exceptions that might occur.

2. The `read_text_file` function is decorated with `@handle_exceptions`. This function reads a file and prints its contents.

3. When `read_text_file` is called, if any error occurs (like the file does not exist), the error will be caught and a message will be printed.

This is a simple example and real-world use-cases can be much more complex, but hopefully, this gives you an idea of how decorators can be used in conjunction with file reading.
