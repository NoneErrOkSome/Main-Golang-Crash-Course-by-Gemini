Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns potentially of different types. It's similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dictionary of Series objects. DataFrames are generally the most commonly used pandas object.

**Creating a DataFrame**

You can create a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists, arrays, or Series. Each key-value pair will be converted to a column in the DataFrame. Here is an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave'],
    'Age': [25, 32, 18, 47],
    'City': ['New York', 'Sydney', 'London', 'Toronto']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)
```

This will output:

```
      Name  Age       City
0    Alice   25   New York
1      Bob   32     Sydney
2  Charlie   18     London
3     Dave   47    Toronto
```

**Accessing DataFrame Elements**

There are several ways to access elements in a DataFrame:

- Using column label: `df['Name']` will return the 'Name' column.
- Using the `loc` function: `df.loc[0]` will return the first row.
- Using the `iloc` function: `df.iloc[0]` will also return the first row.

**DataFrame Operations**

DataFrame supports a variety of operations:

- Arithmetic operations: `df1 + df2`, `df1 * df2`, etc.
- Aggregation functions: `df.mean()`, `df.median()`, `df.sum()`, etc.
- Statistical functions: `df.describe()`, `df.corr()`, etc.

DataFrames also have various attributes for accessing meta-information about the data, such as `df.dtypes`, `df.columns`, `df.index`, `df.shape`, `df.size`, etc.

DataFrames also provide a variety of methods for data manipulation, including data cleaning, reshaping, merging, splitting, and more.
