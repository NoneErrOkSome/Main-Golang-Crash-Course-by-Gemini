Handling missing data is an important step in the data cleaning process. In pandas, missing data is represented as NaN (Not a Number).

**Detecting missing values**

The `isna()` or `isnull()` function can be used to detect missing values. It returns a boolean same-sized object indicating if the values are NA. NA values, such as None or numpy.NaN, gets mapped to True values. Everything else gets mapped to False values.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, np.nan],
                   'B': [5, np.nan, np.nan],
                   'C': [1, 2, 3]})
print(df.isna())
```

**Filling missing values**

The `fillna()` function can "fill in" NA values with non-NA data in a couple of ways, which we illustrate:

```python
print(df.fillna(value=0))  # Fill NA with 0

print(df['A'].fillna(value=df['A'].mean()))  # Fill NA in column 'A' with the mean of non-NA values
```

**Dropping missing values**

The `dropna()` function can remove missing values. By default, it removes any row which contains at least one missing values.

```python
print(df.dropna())  # Drop the rows where at least one element is missing.

print(df.dropna(axis=1))  # Drop the columns where at least one element is missing.

print(df.dropna(thresh=2))  # Keep only the rows with at least 2 non-NA values.
```

Please note that all these functions do not affect the original DataFrame, they return a new DataFrame with the operation performed. If you want the operation to affect the original DataFrame, use the `inplace=True` parameter.
