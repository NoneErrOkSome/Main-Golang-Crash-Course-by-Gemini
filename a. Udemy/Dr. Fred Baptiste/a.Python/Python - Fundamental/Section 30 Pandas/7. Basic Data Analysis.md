Pandas provides many functions and methods to conduct basic data analysis directly on a DataFrame or Series. Here are some basic techniques:

**Descriptive Statistics**

Pandas provides several methods to generate descriptive statistics of a DataFrame or Series. Some of them are:

- `count()`: Number of non-null observations
- `sum()`: Sum of values
- `mean()`: Mean of values
- `median()`: Arithmetic median of values
- `min()`: Minimum
- `max()`: Maximum
- `std()`: Standard deviation
- `var()`: Variance
- `describe()`: Summary statistics

Here is an example of using these methods:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'B': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'C': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df.describe())
```

**Grouping**

Pandas `groupby` function allows you to group rows of data together based off of a column's value. This makes it easy to perform aggregate functions on those groups.

```python
# Group by column 'A' and calculate the mean of the other columns
df.groupby('A').mean()
```

**Correlation**

Pandas provides the `corr` method to calculate the correlation between every pair of columns in the DataFrame. This can be useful for exploring the relationships between variables.

```python
# Calculate the correlation between columns
df.corr()
```

**Value Counts**

Pandas provides the `value_counts` method, which can be used to count the occurrence of each unique value in a Series.

```python
# Count the occurrence of each unique value in column 'A'
df['A'].value_counts()
```

These are only a few of the data analysis functions provided by Pandas. There are many more functions available, allowing you to perform advanced data analysis directly on the DataFrame or Series.
