Pandas library provides several methods to read data from various file formats or data sources. Here are a few commonly used methods:

**Loading Data from CSV**

You can use the `pd.read_csv()` function to load data from a CSV file.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
```

**Loading Data from Excel**

You can use the `pd.read_excel()` function to load data from an Excel file.

```python
# Load data from an Excel file
df = pd.read_excel('filename.xlsx')
```

**Loading Data from SQL**

You can use the `pd.read_sql()` function to load data from a SQL database.

```python
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the database
con = sqlite3.connect("database.db")

# Load data from a SQL query
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM tablename", con)
```

**Loading Data from JSON**

You can use the `pd.read_json()` function to load data from a JSON file.

```python
# Load data from a JSON file
df = pd.read_json('filename.json')
```

All of these functions return a DataFrame that you can then use for data analysis and manipulation. It's also worth noting that these functions have many additional parameters that you can use to customize the loading process, such as specifying the data type of columns, handling missing values, and skipping rows or columns.
