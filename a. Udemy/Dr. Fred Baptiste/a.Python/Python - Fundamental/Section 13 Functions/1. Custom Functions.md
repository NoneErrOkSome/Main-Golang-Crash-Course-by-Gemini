In Python, you can create your own functions using the `def` keyword. These are known as "custom" or "user-defined" functions. Functions allow you to encapsulate a task; they combine many instructions into a single line of code.

Here is the basic syntax for defining a function in Python:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # function body
    return result
```

- `function_name`: This is the name of the function. You can call the function using this name.
- `parameters`: These are the inputs to the function. You can pass values or variables that your function will use.
- `function body`: This is where you write the logic of your function.
- `return`: This keyword is used to specify the result that the function should produce. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately and passes the value on the right hand side of the `return` statement back to the caller. If there is no `return` statement, the function will return `None`.

Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

print(add_numbers(3, 4))  # Outputs: 7
```

In this example, `add_numbers` is a function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, adds them together, and returns the result.

You can also define functions with optional parameters by giving those parameters default values. Here's an example:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
print(greet("Alice", "Goodbye"))  # Outputs: Goodbye, Alice!
```

In this example, `greet` is a function that takes two parameters: `name`, and an optional `greeting` parameter that defaults to `"Hello"` if no other value is provided.

Functions can be used to break down complex problems into smaller parts, to avoid repeating code, and to make your code easier to understand and manage. They are a fundamental aspect of programming in Python.
