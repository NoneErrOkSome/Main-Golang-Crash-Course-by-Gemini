Lambda functions are small anonymous functions that are defined using the `lambda` keyword, hence the name. They can take any number of arguments, but can only contain one expression.

The syntax of lambda functions is as follows:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Here's an example of a lambda function that adds two numbers:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))  # Outputs: 8
```

In this case, `add` is a lambda function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. 

Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope.

One common use of lambda functions is in conjunction with built-in functions like `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`. For example, here's how you could use a lambda function with `map()` to square all numbers in a list:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
print(list(squared))  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `map()` applies the lambda function to each element in `numbers`. The lambda function takes one argument `x` and returns `x ** 2`, effectively squaring the number.

Note: While lambda functions can make your code more concise, they can also make it harder to read if used excessively or for complex logic. For anything beyond simple expressions, it's usually better to define a regular function.
