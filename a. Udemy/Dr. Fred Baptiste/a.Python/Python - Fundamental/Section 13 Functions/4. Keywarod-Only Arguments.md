In Python, you can specify that certain arguments must be specified by keyword. This can make your function calls more clear and self-documenting.

Here is the basic syntax for defining a function with keyword-only arguments:

```python
def function_name(*, kwarg=default_value):
    # function body
```

In this case, `kwarg` is a keyword-only argument that defaults to `default_value` if no value is provided when the function is called.

The `*` in the function definition is what enforces the keyword-only nature of the arguments that follow. It means "collect all positional arguments here". Since there's no argument name before the `*`, there are effectively no positional arguments allowed in the call.

Here's an example:

```python
def describe_person(*, name, age):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")

describe_person(name="Alice", age=25)
```

In this example, `name` and `age` are keyword-only arguments. If you try to call `describe_person` with positional arguments, you'll get an error:

```python
describe_person("Alice", 25)  # Raises a TypeError
```

You can also use `*args` to accept any number of positional arguments, and still define keyword-only arguments after that:

```python
def func(*args, kwarg1, kwarg2=default_value):
    # function body
```

In this case, `args` will be a tuple of all positional arguments that were passed in, and `kwarg1` and `kwarg2` are keyword-only arguments.

Keyword-only arguments can make your code easier to read and understand, because it's clear what each argument is supposed to do. It can also help prevent bugs, because it's harder to accidentally pass arguments in the wrong order when you have to specify their names.
