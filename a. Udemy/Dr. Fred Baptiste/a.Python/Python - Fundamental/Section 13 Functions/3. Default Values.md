In Python, you can provide default values for function arguments. This means that when the function is called without a value for such an argument, the default value is used.

Here is the basic syntax for defining a function with a default value for an argument:

```python
def function_name(arg=default_value):
    # function body
```

In this case, `arg` is a parameter that defaults to `default_value` if no value is provided when the function is called.

Here's an example of a function with default values:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
greet("Bob", "Goodbye")  # Outputs: Goodbye, Bob!
```

In this example, `greet` is a function that takes two parameters: `name`, and `greeting`. If `greeting` is not provided when the function is called, it defaults to `"Hello"`.

One important thing to note is that the default value for a function argument is only evaluated once, when the function is defined. This means that if you use a mutable object (like a list or a dictionary) as a default value, and that object is changed by the function, the change will persist in subsequent calls to the function:

```python
def append_to_list(value, list_to_append=[]):
    list_to_append.append(value)
    return list_to_append

print(append_to_list(1))  # Outputs: [1]
print(append_to_list(2))  # Outputs: [1, 2], not [2] as you might expect
```

In the example above, `list_to_append` is only created once when the function is defined. The same list is used every time the function is called without a second argument, which is why the second call to `append_to_list` outputs `[1, 2]` instead of `[2]`.

To avoid this behavior, you can use `None` as a default value and create a new object in the function body:

```python
def append_to_list(value, list_to_append=None):
    if list_to_append is None:
        list_to_append = []
    list_to_append.append(value)
    return list_to_append

print(append_to_list(1))  # Outputs: [1]
print(append_to_list(2))  # Outputs: [2]
```

In this case, a new list is created every time the function is called without a second argument, so the calls to `append_to_list` are independent.
