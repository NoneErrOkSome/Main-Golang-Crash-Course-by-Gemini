In Python, sequences like strings, lists, and tuples can be manipulated in a variety of ways. Here are some common operations:

1. **Concatenation**: You can combine two sequences of the same type using the `+` operator. 

    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6]
    print(list1 + list2)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    str1 = "Hello, "
    str2 = "world!"
    print(str1 + str2)  # "Hello, world!"
    ```

2. **Repetition**: You can repeat a sequence using the `*` operator.

    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    print(list1 * 3)  # [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

    str1 = "Hello! "
    print(str1 * 3)  # "Hello! Hello! Hello! "
    ```

3. **Membership**: You can check if an item exists in a sequence using the `in` keyword.

    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    print(1 in list1)  # True

    str1 = "Hello, world!"
    print("world" in str1)  # True
    ```

4. **Length, min, max**: You can find the number of items in a sequence using the `len()` function, the smallest item using the `min()` function, and the largest item using the `max()` function.

    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    print(len(list1))  # 3
    print(min(list1))  # 1
    print(max(list1))  # 3
    ```

5. **Indexing and Slicing**: You can access a specific item in a sequence by its index, or a subset of a sequence by slicing.

    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    print(list1[1])  # 2
    print(list1[-1])  # 3
    print(list1[1:3])  # [2, 3]

    str1 = "Hello, world!"
    print(str1[7])  # 'w'
    print(str1[-1])  # '!'
    print(str1[7:12])  # 'world'
    ```

6. **Modifying sequences**: Lists can be modified, but strings and tuples cannot (they are immutable). You can add an item to a list with `append()`, remove an item with `remove()`, or change an item by assigning a new value to a specific index.

    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list1.append(4)
    print(list1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

    list1.remove(1)
    print(list1)  # [2, 3, 4]

    list1[1] = 20
    print(list1)  # [2, 20, 4]
    ```

These are just a few of the many ways you can manipulate sequences in Python. There are many more methods and functions available, depending on the specific type of sequence you're working with.
