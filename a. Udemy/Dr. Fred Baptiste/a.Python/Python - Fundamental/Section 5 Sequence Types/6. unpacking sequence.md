Unpacking in Python is a mechanism where iterable elements can be unpacked into variables. This is quite a handy feature provided by Python.

Here are some examples of unpacking sequences:

1. **Basic Unpacking**

    You can unpack sequences (like list, tuple, etc) into different variables:

    ```python
    data = [1, 2, 3]
    a, b, c = data
    print(a)  # 1
    print(b)  # 2
    print(c)  # 3
    ```

2. **Unpacking with Ignoring**

    Sometimes, you might not be interested in all the values, and Python allows ignoring the ones you are not interested in:

    ```python
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    a, b, *_, c = data
    print(a)  # 1
    print(b)  # 2
    print(c)  # 5
    ```

    Here, `_` is used to ignore unnecessary values. It's a convention to indicate that these values are throwaway.

3. **Nested Unpacking**

    Unpacking can also deal with complex/nested data structures:

    ```python
    data = ["John", ("age", 30), "New York"]
    name, ("age", age), city = data
    print(name)  # "John"
    print(age)  # 30
    print(city)  # "New York"
    ```

4. **Starred Unpacking**

    Starred expressions `*` can be used in the unpacking for grabbing excess items:

    ```python
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    first, *middle, last = data
    print(first)  # 1
    print(middle)  # [2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(last)  # 6
    ```

    Here, `*middle` is used to hold the excess items.

Unpacking is a powerful tool in Python that makes your code more readable and self-explanatory, and allows for greater flexibility when dealing with sequences.
