In Python, a list is a built-in data type that can be used to store a collection of items. It is an ordered sequence of items, and these items can be of any type and can be repeated. Lists are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or change elements after the list is created. 

Here are some common operations you can perform with lists:

1. **Creating a list**: You can create a list by placing a comma-separated sequence of items inside square brackets `[]`.

   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   mixed = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]
   print(mixed)  # [1, 'Hello', 3.14, True]
   ```

2. **Accessing elements**: You can access an element in a list by its index, which is zero-based.

   ```python
   print(numbers[0])  # 1
   print(mixed[1])  # 'Hello'
   ```

3. **Slicing**: You can get a subset of a list using the slicing operator `:`.

   ```python
   print(numbers[1:3])  # [2, 3]
   ```

4. **Updating elements**: Lists are mutable, so you can change an element using its index.

   ```python
   numbers[0] = 100
   print(numbers)  # [100, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

5. **Adding elements**: You can add an element at the end of a list using the `append()` method, or insert it at a specific position using the `insert()` method.

   ```python
   numbers.append(6)
   print(numbers)  # [100, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

   numbers.insert(1, 200)
   print(numbers)  # [100, 200, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

6. **Removing elements**: You can remove an element by its value using the `remove()` method, or by its index using the `del` keyword or the `pop()` method.

   ```python
   numbers.remove(200)
   print(numbers)  # [100, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

   del numbers[0]
   print(numbers)  # [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

   numbers.pop(1)
   print(numbers)  # [2, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

7. **Length of a list**: You can get the number of elements in a list using the `len()` function.

   ```python
   print(len(numbers))  # 4
   ```

8. **Sorting a list**: You can sort a list in ascending order using the `sort()` method, or in descending order using the `sort()` method with `reverse=True`.

   ```python
   numbers.sort()
   print(numbers)  # [2, 4, 5, 6]

   numbers.sort(reverse=True)
   print(numbers)  # [6, 5, 4, 2]
   ```

9. **Concatenation and repetition**: You can combine two lists using the `+` operator, or repeat a list using the `*` operator.

   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2, 3]
   list2 = [4, 5, 6]
   combined = list1 + list2
   print(combined)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

   repeated = list1 * 3
   print(repeated)  # [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
   ```

This operation concatenates or joins two lists into one, and the repetition operation repeats the list a given number of times.
