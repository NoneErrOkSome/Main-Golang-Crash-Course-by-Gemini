Deep copy and shallow copy are two concepts in Python that pertain to duplicating objects, but they differ in how they handle the original object's elements, particularly when it comes to nested objects or objects containing other objects.

### Shallow Copy

- **What It Does**: A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the references of the original elements. 
- **Behavior with Nested Objects**: For nested objects (like lists of lists), a shallow copy doesn't create copies of the nested objects. Instead, it just copies the references to these objects. So, if you modify a nested object in the original, the change will appear in the shallow copy and vice versa.
- **How to Create**: In Python, you can create a shallow copy using methods like the `list.copy()` method, slicing (`list[:]`), or the `copy.copy()` function from the `copy` module.

### Deep Copy

- **What It Does**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all the objects it finds inside the original object. Essentially, it creates copies of the entire structure.
- **Behavior with Nested Objects**: For nested objects, a deep copy creates new and separate copies of the nested objects. Therefore, changes to any level of the nested objects in the original won't affect the copied object and vice versa.
- **How to Create**: In Python, a deep copy is created using the `copy.deepcopy()` function from the `copy` module.

### Example

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```python
import copy

# Original list with nested list
original_list = [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

# Shallow copy
shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)

# Deep copy
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

# Modify nested list
original_list[0][0] = "changed"

# Results
print(original_list)           # [['changed', 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
print(shallow_copied_list)     # [['changed', 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
print(deep_copied_list)        # [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
```

In this example:
- The change in the nested list of `original_list` also appears in `shallow_copied_list` because the shallow copy holds references to the same nested list.
- The `deep_copied_list` remains unaffected by changes in `original_list` since it holds separate copies of all nested objects.

### Use Cases

- **Shallow Copy**: Use when you want a new container with the same contents but are okay with the contents themselves being shared.
- **Deep Copy**: Use when you need an entirely independent copy of an entire structure, including all nested objects.

Understanding the distinction between deep and shallow copies is crucial when working with mutable objects in Python to avoid unintended side-effects.

Certainly! Let's use a simple list (not a nested list) to demonstrate both shallow and deep copying. For such lists containing only immutable elements (like integers or strings), the distinction between shallow and deep copy is less pronounced, but it's still a good exercise to understand the concept.

### Example with a Normal List

Let's consider a list of integers:

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Shallow Copy

Using slicing to create a shallow copy:

```python
shallow_copied_list = original_list[:]

# Modifying the shallow copied list
shallow_copied_list[0] = 99

# Results
print("Original List:", original_list)          # Output: Original List: [1, 2, 3]
print("Shallow Copied List:", shallow_copied_list)  # Output: Shallow Copied List: [99, 2, 3]
```

In this case, changing `shallow_copied_list` does not affect `original_list` because the elements are immutable. The shallow copy creates a new list object but with the same elements. Changing an element in the copied list essentially places a new element at that index.

#### Deep Copy

Using `copy.deepcopy()` for a deep copy:

```python
import copy

deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

# Modifying the deep copied list
deep_copied_list[0] = 99

# Results
print("Original List:", original_list)          # Output: Original List: [1, 2, 3]
print("Deep Copied List:", deep_copied_list)    # Output: Deep Copied List: [99, 2, 3]
```

Again, in this scenario, the original list remains unchanged. Since integers are immutable, a deep copy behaves much like a shallow copy.

### Summary of This Case

In the case of a list of immutable elements (like integers, strings, or tuples), both shallow and deep copies create an independent copy of the list. Modifications to the copied list do not affect the original list. This is because even though a shallow copy duplicates the references, altering an element actually replaces the reference at that index with a reference to a new object. With immutable types, there is no way to "change" the object itself; any "modification" results in a new object.
