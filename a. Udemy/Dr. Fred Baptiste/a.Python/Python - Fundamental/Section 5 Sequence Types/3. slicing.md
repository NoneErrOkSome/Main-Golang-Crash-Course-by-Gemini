Slicing in Python is a feature that enables accessing parts of sequences like strings, tuples, and lists. You can also modify parts of lists with slices. Slicing does not work the same way with dictionaries or sets.

Here's a general way of using slicing in Python:

```python
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

- `start`: The starting index where the slice starts (inclusive). Defaults to `0` if not provided.
- `stop`: The ending index where the slice stops (exclusive). Defaults to `len(sequence)` if not provided.
- `step`: It is an optional argument that determines the increment between each index for slicing. Defaults to `1` if not provided.

Here's an example of slicing with a list:

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# get numbers from index 1 to 4
print(numbers[1:5])  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# get numbers from index 3 to the end
print(numbers[3:])  # [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# get numbers from the start to index 5
print(numbers[:6])  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# get numbers from index 2 to 7 with a step of 2
print(numbers[2:8:2])  # [2, 4, 6]

# get all numbers with a step of 3
print(numbers[::3])  # [0, 3, 6, 9]

# get numbers in reverse order
print(numbers[::-1])  # [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

The same concept applies to tuples and strings:

```python
# tuple slicing
t = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(t[2:5])  # (2, 3, 4)

# string slicing
s = 'Hello, world!'
print(s[7:12])  # 'world'
```

Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing, meaning that the index of the first element is `0`, the index of the second element is `1`, and so on. Also, note that the `stop` index is exclusive, meaning the slice will include elements up to `stop - 1`.
