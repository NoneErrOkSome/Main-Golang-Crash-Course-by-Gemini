Working with REST APIs is a common task in Python. REST APIs are interfaces to web services that use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations. They're used to interact with many web services like social networks, databases, and other types of software applications.

A common library for making HTTP requests in Python is `requests`.

To install `requests`, use pip:

```
pip install requests
```

Here are some examples of how to use the `requests` library to interact with REST APIs:

**1. Making a GET request:**

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')

# The response of a GET request often has some valuable information, known as a payload, in the message body
print(response.json())
```

In this example, we make a GET request to the GitHub API. The `.json()` method is used to convert the response to a JSON object, which is a Python dictionary.

**2. Making a POST request:**

```python
import requests

# The payload to send to the API
payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

response = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)

# Print the response
print(response.json())
```

In this example, we make a POST request to httpbin, which is a simple HTTP request/response service. The payload is sent in the body of the POST request.

**3. Passing Parameters in GET:**

```python
import requests

# The parameters to send with the GET request
payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)

# Print the response
print(response.json())
```

In this example, we pass parameters to a GET request by adding them to the URL. The parameters are provided as a dictionary to the `params` parameter of the `get` method.

**4. Handling Errors:**

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError

for url in ['https://api.github.com', 'https://api.github.com/invalid']:
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)

        # If the response was successful, no Exception will be raised
        response.raise_for_status()
    except HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f'HTTP error occurred: {http_err}')  # Python 3.6
    except Exception as err:
        print(f'Other error occurred: {err}')  # Python 3.6
    else:
        print('Success!')
```

In this example, we use a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions when making a GET request. The `raise_for_status` method of a response object will raise an `HTTPError` exception if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.

Please note, these examples are basic, and real-world applications often involve more complex scenarios when working with REST APIs. Also, always remember to check the API documentation for details on how to interact with the API.
