The `python-dateutil` module is a powerful extension to the standard `datetime` module available in Python. It provides additional functionality like computing relative deltas (next Monday, last Tuesday of the month, etc.), parsing dates and times from strings, and more.

To install `python-dateutil`, use pip:

```
pip install python-dateutil
```

Here are some common operations you might perform using the `python-dateutil` library:

**1. Parsing a string into a datetime object:**

The `parse` function in the `dateutil.parser` module can parse a date and time from a string.

```python
from dateutil.parser import parse

dt = parse('2023-09-18 10:15:45')
print(dt)  # Output: 2023-09-18 10:15:45
```

**2. Computing relative dates:**

The `relativedelta` function in the `dateutil.relativedelta` module can compute relative dates.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

now = datetime.now()

# Compute the date 2 months from now
future_date = now + relativedelta(months=+2)
print(future_date)
```

**3. Handling time zones:**

The `dateutil.tz` module provides classes for working with time zones.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil import tz

# Create a timezone object for the Eastern Time zone
eastern = tz.gettz('America/New_York')

# Get the current date and time in the Eastern Time zone
now_in_eastern = datetime.now(eastern)
print(now_in_eastern)
```

These are just a few examples of the functionalities provided by the `python-dateutil` module. It has many more features that provide power and flexibility in handling dates and times in Python.
