JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data format with a diverse range of applications. It is human readable, and it's used for structuring data in a way that's easy to read and write. It's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications, configuration files, and data storage.

Python has a built-in module named `json` for encoding and decoding JSON data. Here are some examples of how to use it.

**1. Convert Python objects to JSON (Serialization):**

```python
import json

# A Python object (dict)
x = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}

# Convert into JSON
y = json.dumps(x)

# The result is a JSON string
print(y)  # Output: {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

`json.dumps()` method can convert a Python object into a JSON string.

**2. Convert JSON to Python objects (Deserialization):**

```python
import json

# Some JSON
x =  '{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'

# Parse JSON - convert from JSON to Python
y = json.loads(x)

# The result is a Python dictionary
print(y)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```

`json.loads()` method can convert a JSON string into a Python object.

**3. Writing JSON to a file:**

```python
import json

data = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}

with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

`json.dump()` method can be used to write a Python object as JSON data into a file.

**4. Reading JSON from a file:**

```python
import json

with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(data)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```

`json.load()` method can be used to load JSON data from a file into a Python object.
