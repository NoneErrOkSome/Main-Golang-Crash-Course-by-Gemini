The `requests` library is one of the most popular Python libraries for making HTTP requests. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple API, allowing you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters to HTTP requests via simple Python libraries to HTTP requests.

To install `requests`, use pip:

```
pip install requests
```

Here are some examples of how to use the `requests` library:

**1. Making a GET request:**

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')

# The response of a GET request often has some valuable information, known as a payload, in the message body
print(response.json())
```

In this example, a GET request is made to the GitHub API. The `.json()` method is used to convert the response to a JSON object, which is a Python dictionary.

**2. Making a POST request:**

```python
import requests

# The data to send with the POST request
data = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

response = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=data)

# Print the response
print(response.json())
```

In this example, a POST request is sent to httpbin, a simple HTTP request/response service. The data is sent in the body of the POST request.

**3. Adding headers to the request:**

```python
import requests

# Define the headers
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

In this example, headers are added to the GET request. Headers often contain additional information for the server, like the format of the response data we want, or authorization details.

**4. Error handling:**

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError

for url in ['https://api.github.com', 'https://api.github.com/invalid']:
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)

        # If the response was successful, no Exception will be raised
        response.raise_for_status()
    except HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f'HTTP error occurred: {http_err}')  
    except Exception as err:
        print(f'Other error occurred: {err}')  
    else:
        print('Success!')
```

In this example, we use a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions when making a GET request. The `raise_for_status` method of a response object will raise an `HTTPError` exception if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.

Remember, these examples are basic, and real-world applications often involve more complex scenarios when working with the `requests` library. Always check the library's documentation for further details and functionalities.
