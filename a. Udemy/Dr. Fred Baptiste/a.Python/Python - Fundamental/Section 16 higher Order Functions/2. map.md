In Python, `map()` is a built-in higher-order function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as list, tuple etc.) and returns a map object. 

Here's the basic usage:

```python
def square(n):
    return n * n

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = map(square, numbers)

# Convert the result to a list and print it
print(list(result))  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `map()` applies the `square` function to each element in the `numbers` list.

`map()` returns a map object, which is an iterator. To get a list out of it, we need to convert the result to a list using `list()` function as shown in the example. If you prefer, you can convert it to another type of collection, such as a tuple or a set.

`map()` works with multiple iterables as well. The iterables should be the same length - if they are not, `map()` will stop as soon as the shortest iterable is exhausted.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

result = map(add, numbers1, numbers2)
print(list(result))  # Outputs: [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
```

In this case, `add` is applied to pairs of elements from `numbers1` and `numbers2`.

`map()` can also be used with a lambda function:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)
print(list(result))  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Here, a lambda function that squares its input is passed to `map()`. This version is more concise, but can be harder to read if the function you're mapping is complex. For anything beyond simple expressions, it's usually better to define a separate function.
