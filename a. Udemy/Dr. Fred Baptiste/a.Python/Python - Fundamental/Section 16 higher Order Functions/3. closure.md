In Python, a closure is a function object that has access to variables from its enclosing lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope. This means the function has access to variables that were in scope at the time the function was defined, and it "remembers" these variables.

Here's an example of a closure in Python:

```python
def outer_function(x):
    def inner_function(y):
        return x + y
    return inner_function

closure = outer_function(10)
print(closure(5))  # Outputs: 15
```

In this example, `outer_function` returns the `inner_function`, and `inner_function` is a closure because it has access to `x`, which is a variable in the enclosing scope of `outer_function`.

The `outer_function` is called with the argument `10`, and it returns the `inner_function` that adds `10` to its argument. The returned function is assigned to the `closure` variable.

Then, when `closure` is called with the argument `5`, it adds `5` to `10` (which was remembered from the scope of `outer_function`) and returns `15`.

Closures are used for a variety of purposes. One common use case is data hiding and encapsulation. Another use case is when you want to generate and return a function that's "configured" with some data, like in the example above.

In more advanced scenarios, closures are used in decorator functions, which are a way to modify or enhance functions or methods with additional functionality, without changing their source code.
