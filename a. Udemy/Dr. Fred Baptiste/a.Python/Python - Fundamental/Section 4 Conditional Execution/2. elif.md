The `elif` statement in Python is a way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition". It stands for "else if".

The `elif` statement allows you to check multiple expressions for `True` and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to `True`.

Like `else`, the `elif` statement is optional. However, unlike `else`, for which there can be at most one statement, there can be an arbitrary number of `elif` statements following an `if`.

Here's an example to illustrate its usage:

```python
x = 20
if x < 10:
    print("x is less than 10")
elif x < 20:
    print("x is less than 20")
elif x < 30:
    print("x is less than 30")
else:
    print("x is 30 or more")
```

In this example, the first `if` statement checks if x is less than 10. If this is not the case, it then checks the `elif` statements one by one. If one of them is `True`, it executes the corresponding block of code and skips the rest. If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions is `True`, it executes the block of code in the `else` statement, if there is one. 

In this case, "x is less than 30" will be printed because x equals 20, which is less than 30 but not less than 10 or 20.
