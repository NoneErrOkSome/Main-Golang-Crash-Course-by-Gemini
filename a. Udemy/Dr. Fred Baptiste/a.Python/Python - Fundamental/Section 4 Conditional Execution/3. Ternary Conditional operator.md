Python has a built-in conditional expression, sometimes referred to as a ternary operator. It provides a way to condense a simple `if-else` conditional block into a single line of code.

The basic structure of the ternary operator in Python is:

```python
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

For example, let's say we have two values `a = 10` and `b = 20`, and we want to assign the minimum value to a variable `min_val`. Using the ternary operator, we could do the following:

```python
a = 10
b = 20
min_val = a if a < b else b
```

In this case, `min_val` will be assigned the value of `a` because the condition `a < b` is `True`.

This construct is very useful for short, simple conditions and assignments, but it can become harder to read with more complex conditions. In those cases, it's usually better to stick with a standard `if-else` block.
