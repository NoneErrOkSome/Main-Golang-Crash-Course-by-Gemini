Conditional execution in Python involves using `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords to control the flow of a program based on whether certain conditions are met. Here's a basic overview:

1. **`if`**: The `if` keyword is used to check a condition: if the condition is true, it executes the block of code inside it.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

In this case, because x is indeed greater than 5, the string "x is greater than 5" will be printed.

2. **`else`**: The `else` keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

```python
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

In this case, because x is not greater than 5, the string "x is not greater than 5" will be printed.

3. **`elif`**: The `elif` keyword is pythoneese for "else if". It allows us to check for multiple expressions. If the condition for `if` is `False`, it checks the condition of the next `elif` block and so on. If all the conditions are `False`, the body of `else` is executed.

```python
x = 5
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
else:
    print("x is equal to 5")
```

In this case, because x is not greater than or less than 5, the string "x is equal to 5" will be printed.

Remember, in Python, the block of code under each `if`, `else`, or `elif` is indented. It's this indentation that Python uses to group code together.
