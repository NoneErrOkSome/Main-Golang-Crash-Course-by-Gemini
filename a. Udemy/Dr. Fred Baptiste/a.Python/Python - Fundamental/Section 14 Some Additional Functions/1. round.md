The `round()` function in Python is a built-in function that rounds a number to the nearest integer or to the specified number of decimals. Here is how you can use it:

```python
print(round(5.7631))  # Output: 6
print(round(5.7631, 2))  # Output: 5.76
```

In the first example, `round(5.7631)` returns the nearest integer to `5.7631`, which is `6`. In the second example, `round(5.7631, 2)` returns the number `5.7631` rounded to 2 decimal places, which is `5.76`.

You can use the `round()` function in a lambda function. For example, you might have a list of floats and you want to round each float to the nearest integer. You can do this with the `map()` function and a lambda function:

```python
numbers = [1.2, 2.6, 3.5, 4.9]
rounded_numbers = map(lambda x: round(x), numbers)
print(list(rounded_numbers))  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, `map()` applies the lambda function to each element in `numbers`. The lambda function takes one argument `x` and returns `round(x)`, effectively rounding the number to the nearest integer.

You can also round each number to a certain number of decimal places by adding another argument to `round()` in the lambda function:

```python
numbers = [1.23456, 2.34567, 3.45678]
rounded_numbers = map(lambda x: round(x, 3), numbers)
print(list(rounded_numbers))  # Output: [1.235, 2.346, 3.457]
```

In this case, the lambda function rounds each number to 3 decimal places.

The `round()` function in Python is used to round a number to a specified number of digits or to the nearest integer. 

Here's the basic usage of `round()`:

```python
print(round(5.76))  # Outputs: 6
```

In the example above, `round()` is used to round the floating-point number `5.76` to the nearest integer, which is `6`.

You can also specify the number of decimal places you want to round to by passing a second argument to `round()`. Here's an example:

```python
print(round(5.76543, 2))  # Outputs: 5.77
```

In this case, `round()` is used to round `5.76543` to the nearest hundredth, resulting in `5.77`.

The `round()` function uses "round half to even" strategy - commonly known as "bankers' rounding". This means that if the number to be rounded is exactly halfway between two other numbers, it will be rounded towards the nearest even number. Here's an example:

```python
print(round(1.5))  # Outputs: 2
print(round(2.5))  # Outputs: 2
```

In the first call to `round()`, `1.5` is rounded up to `2`. In the second call, `2.5` is also rounded to `2` because it's halfway between `2` and `3`, and `2` is the closest even number. This method of rounding is designed to reduce the bias that can occur from always rounding .5 up or down. 

The `round()` function is a built-in Python function and does not need to be imported from any library.
