Sorting is an important operation that you often need to do with data. Python provides several methods to sort elements.

**`sorted()` Function**

The built-in `sorted()` function returns a new list containing all elements from the iterable sorted in ascending order.

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You can sort in descending order by setting the `reverse` parameter to `True`:

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Outputs: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

You can also sort a list of strings, or any other sequence of comparable elements:

```python
words = ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'orange']
sorted_words = sorted(words)
print(sorted_words)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'orange']
```

**`list.sort()` Method**

Lists have a built-in `sort()` method that sorts the elements in-place, i.e., it modifies the original list. 

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Like `sorted()`, `list.sort()` also accepts the `reverse` parameter to sort in descending order.

**Sorting by a Key Function**

Both `sorted()` and `list.sort()` accept a `key` parameter that lets you provide a function to be applied to each element before comparison. The output of the key function will be used in the sorting algorithm.

For example, if you have a list of strings and you want to sort them by their length, you could do:

```python
words = ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'orange']
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)
print(sorted_words)  # Outputs: ['kiwi', 'apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```

In this example, `len` is used as the key function, so the strings are sorted by their length. The shortest string comes first, and the longest comes last.

This key function mechanism provides a powerful tool to customize the sort order in any way you need. For instance, you can use a key function to sort objects by their attributes, dictionaries by their values, and so on.
