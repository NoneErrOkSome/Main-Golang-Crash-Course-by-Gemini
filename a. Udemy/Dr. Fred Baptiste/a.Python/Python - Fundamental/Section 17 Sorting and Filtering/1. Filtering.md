Python provides several ways to filter elements from a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. 

**Using the `filter()` Function**

`filter()` is a built-in function that creates a new iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. 

Here is an example where `filter()` is used to get all the even numbers from a list:

```python
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))  # Outputs: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, `filter()` applies the `is_even` function to each element in `numbers`. If `is_even` returns `True`, the element is included in the output.

`filter()` returns a filter object, which is an iterator. To get a list out of it, you need to pass it to the `list()` function.

You can also use a lambda function instead of a regular function:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))  # Outputs: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Using List Comprehension**

List comprehension is a more pythonic way to filter elements from a list. It's often more concise and easier to read than using `filter()`. Here's the previous example done with list comprehension:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Outputs: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, `[x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]` is a list comprehension that creates a new list from elements in `numbers` for which `x % 2 == 0` is `True`.
