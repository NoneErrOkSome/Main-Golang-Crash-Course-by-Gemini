The `min()` and `max()` functions in Python are used to find the minimum and maximum value respectively among the arguments passed or from elements in an iterable.

Here's an example of `min()` and `max()` being used with a list of numbers:

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]

min_number = min(numbers)
max_number = max(numbers)

print(min_number)  # Outputs: 1
print(max_number)  # Outputs: 5
```

In this example, `min(numbers)` returns the smallest number in the list and `max(numbers)` returns the largest number.

You can also use `min()` and `max()` with a list of strings. In that case, the functions return the "smallest" or "largest" string in lexicographical (alphabetical) order:

```python
words = ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'orange']

min_word = min(words)
max_word = max(words)

print(min_word)  # Outputs: 'apple'
print(max_word)  # Outputs: 'orange'
```

Just like with sorting, you can pass a `key` function to `min()` and `max()` to customize the comparison. For example, you could find the shortest and longest words in a list like this:

```python
words = ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'orange']

shortest_word = min(words, key=len)
longest_word = max(words, key=len)

print(shortest_word)  # Outputs: 'kiwi'
print(longest_word)  # Outputs: 'banana'
```

In this example, `len` is used as the key function, so `min()` and `max()` return the words with the smallest and largest length respectively.
