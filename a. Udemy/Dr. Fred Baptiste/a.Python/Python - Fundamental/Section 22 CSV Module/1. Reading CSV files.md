Pythonâ€™s `csv` module allows you to easily work with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. These files are often used for exchanging data between different applications and data storage and manipulation.

Here is a simple way to read a CSV file using the `csv.reader` function.

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

In this example, we first import the `csv` module. Then we open the file 'example.csv' in read mode ('r') using the `open` function, which returns a file object. This object is then used as the argument to the `csv.reader` function, which returns a reader object that iterates over lines in the CSV file. Each line is returned as a list of strings. We use a for loop to iterate over these lines.

Note: The above example assumes that the file `example.csv` is in the same directory as your Python script. If it's in a different location, you'll need to provide the full path to the file.

If your CSV file has a header row, you might want to read that separately and then read the rest of the rows like this:

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    header = next(reader)  # Reads the header row
    for row in reader:  # Reads the remaining rows
        print(row)
```

In this case, `next(reader)` is used to read the first row (the header), and then the for loop starts at the second row and reads the rest of the file. This is useful when you want to do something different with the header compared to the rest of the rows.
