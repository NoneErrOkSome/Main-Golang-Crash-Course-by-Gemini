Python's `csv` module also provides functionality to write data into CSV files. You can write to a CSV file using the `csv.writer` object and its `writerow` and `writerows` methods.

Here is a basic example of writing data to a CSV file:

```python
import csv

# Some data to write
data = [["Name", "Age"], ["Alice", 30], ["Bob", 25], ["Charlie", 35]]

with open('example.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
```

In this example, `csv.writer(file)` creates a writer object that converts the user's data into a delimited string. The `writerows` method writes all given rows to the CSV file.

Note: The `newline=''` parameter in the `open` function is needed to prevent `csv.writer` from adding an extra line between rows in Windows.

If you want to write data row by row, you can use the `writerow` method:

```python
import csv

# Some data to write
header = ["Name", "Age"]
data = [["Alice", 30], ["Bob", 25], ["Charlie", 35]]

with open('example.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(header)
    for row in data:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

**Writing a dictionary to a CSV file:**

If your data is in a dictionary, you can use the `csv.DictWriter` object to write it to a CSV file. `DictWriter` creates an object that writes dictionaries to the output file:

```python
import csv

# Field names
fields = ['Name', 'Age']

# Data rows of csv file
rows = [{'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': 30},
        {'Name': 'Bob', 'Age': 25},
        {'Name': 'Charlie', 'Age': 35}]

with open('example.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames = fields)
    writer.writeheader()  # Writes the field names
    writer.writerows(rows)  # Writes the dictionary data
```

In this example, the `writeheader` method writes the field names (column headers), and `writerows` writes the dictionary data. The keys in each dictionary are matched to the field names to determine the order.
