Here are some more examples of reading CSV files using the `csv` module in Python.

**Example 1 - Reading CSV as a dictionary with csv.DictReader:**

The `csv.DictReader` function creates an object that operates like a regular reader but maps the information in each row to an `OrderedDict` whose keys are given by the optional `fieldnames` parameter.

If `fieldnames` is omitted, the values in the first row of the file will be used as the fieldnames.

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

In this case, each row is a dictionary and you can access values using column names as keys.

**Example 2 - Specifying a different delimiter:**

By default, the `csv` module uses a comma as the delimiter. If your CSV file uses a different delimiter, you can specify it using the `delimiter` argument.

For instance, to read a tab-delimited file:

```python
import csv

with open('example.tsv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter='\t')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

**Example 3 - Reading CSV files with a specific encoding:**

Some CSV files may be written in different encodings. If you know the encoding, you can specify it when you open the file.

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

In the example above, the CSV file is read with the 'utf-8' encoding.

Remember to replace `'example.csv'` and `'example.tsv'` with the path to your CSV or TSV file.
