In CSV files, the format isn't completely standardized; differences can exist in terms of delimiters, quote characters, line terminators, etc. The `csv` module in Python handles this by defining something called "dialects".

A "dialect" in Python's `csv` module is a convenient name for a set of formatting parameters, which allows you to customize the way CSV data is parsed. For example, the dialect allows you to change the character used as a delimiter, whether the first row is treated as field names (header), the character used to quote fields, and other parameters.

The `csv` module defines a class `Dialect` as the parent class for all dialects, and also provides some pre-defined dialects like `excel`, `excel-tab`, `unix`, etc.

Here is how you define a custom dialect using the `csv.register_dialect()` method:

```python
import csv

csv.register_dialect(
    'my_dialect',
    delimiter = ',',
    quotechar = '"',
    doublequote = True,
    skipinitialspace = True,
    lineterminator = '\r\n',
    quoting = csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)

# Now use the new dialect to read a CSV file
with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, dialect='my_dialect')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

In the above code:

- `delimiter`: This is the character used to separate fields. The default is ','.
- `quotechar`: This is the character used to surround fields that contain the delimiter character. The default is '"'.
- `doublequote`: This controls how instances of `quotechar` appearing inside a field are quoted. The default is `True`.
- `skipinitialspace`: When `True`, whitespace immediately following the delimiter is ignored. The default is `False`.
- `lineterminator`: This is the character sequence used to terminate lines produced by the `writer`. The default is '\r\n'.
- `quoting`: This controls when quotes should be generated by the `writer` or recognized by the `reader`. It can take on any of the `QUOTE_*` constants provided by the `csv` module and defaults to `QUOTE_MINIMAL`.

The `csv.register_dialect()` function allows you to name your custom dialect and use it later, which can be very useful if you're dealing with multiple CSV formats in your code.
