Python's `math` module provides mathematical functions, for tasks such as power and logarithmic computations, trigonometric computations, and complex number operations.

You need to import the module before you use it:

```python
import math
```

Here are some common functions provided by the `math` module:

**1. Constants:**

The `math` module provides mathematical constants:

- `math.pi`: The mathematical constant π = 3.141592..., to available precision.
- `math.e`: The mathematical constant e = 2.718281..., to available precision.
- `math.tau`: The mathematical constant τ = 6.283185..., to available precision. Tau is a circle’s circumference divided by its radius.
- `math.inf`: A floating-point positive infinity. (For negative infinity, use `-math.inf`.)

**2. Number-theoretic and representation functions:**

- `math.ceil(x)`: Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
- `math.floor(x)`: Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x.
- `math.fabs(x)`: Return the absolute value of x.

**3. Power and logarithmic functions:**

- `math.exp(x)`: Return e raised to the power x, where e is the base of natural logarithms.
- `math.log(x[, base])`: With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e). With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base.
- `math.pow(x, y)`: Return x raised to the power y.
- `math.sqrt(x)`: Return the square root of x.

**4. Trigonometric functions:**

- `math.sin(x)`: Return the sine of x radians.
- `math.cos(x)`: Return the cosine of x radians.
- `math.tan(x)`: Return the tangent of x radians.

**5. Angular conversion:**

- `math.degrees(x)`: Converts angle x from radians to degrees.
- `math.radians(x)`: Converts angle x from degrees to radians.

**6. Hyperbolic functions:**

- `math.sinh(x)`: Return the hyperbolic sine of x.
- `math.cosh(x)`: Return the hyperbolic cosine of x.
- `math.tanh(x)`: Return the hyperbolic tangent of x.
