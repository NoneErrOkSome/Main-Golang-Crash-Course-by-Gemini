The `statistics` module in Python provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data.

You need to import the module before you use it:

```python
import statistics
```

Here are some common functions provided by the `statistics` module:

**1. Measures of central tendency**

These functions calculate the central tendency of data, i.e., mean, median, mode:

- `statistics.mean(data)`: Return the sample arithmetic mean of data which can be a sequence or iterable.
  
```python
import statistics
print(statistics.mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]))  # Output: 2.8
```

- `statistics.median(data)`: Return the median (middle value) of numeric data, using the common “mean of middle two” method. If data is even, the median is interpolated by taking the average of the two middle values.

```python
import statistics
print(statistics.median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3
```

- `statistics.mode(data)`: Return the single most common data point from discrete or nominal data. Raises StatisticsError if no unique mode is found.

```python
import statistics
print(statistics.mode([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]))  # Output: 3
```

**2. Measures of spread**

These functions calculate the spread of data, i.e., variance, standard deviation:

- `statistics.variance(data, xbar=None)`: Return the sample variance of data, an iterable of at least two real-valued numbers. Variance, or second moment about the mean, is a measure of the variability (spread or dispersion) of data. A large variance indicates that the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely around the mean.

```python
import statistics
print(statistics.variance([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 2.5
```

- `statistics.stdev(data, xbar=None)`: Return the square root of the sample variance.

```python
import statistics
print(statistics.stdev([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 1.5811388300841898
```

These are just a few examples. The `statistics` module includes other functions such as `pvariance`, `pstdev` for population variance and population standard deviation, `harmonic_mean`, `median_low`, `median_high`, `median_grouped`, `quantiles` and more.
