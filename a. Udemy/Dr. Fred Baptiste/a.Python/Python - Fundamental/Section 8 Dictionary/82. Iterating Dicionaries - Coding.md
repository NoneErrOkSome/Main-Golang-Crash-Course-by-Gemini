### Iterating Over Dictionaries in Python

When working with dictionaries in Python, we often need to iterate through them. However, dictionaries are not sequence types; they are collections of key-value pairs. This raises the question: what exactly are we iterating overâ€”the keys, the values, or both?

#### Iterating Over Keys
By default, iterating over a dictionary iterates over its keys:
```python
d = {'key 1': 1, 'key 2': 2, 3.14: 'pi'}
for k in d:
    print(k)
```

#### Accessing Values During Iteration
While iterating over keys, it's straightforward to access the corresponding values:
```python
for k in d:
    print(f'{k} = {d[k]}')
```

#### Iterating Over Values
Sometimes, we might only need to iterate over the values, disregarding the keys. In this case, we can use the `values()` method:
```python
for v in d.values():
    print(v)
```

#### Iterating Over Key-Value Pairs
Alternatively, we can iterate over both keys and values simultaneously using the `items()` method. This method creates a view containing tuples, where each tuple consists of a key-value pair:
```python
for t in d.items():
    print(t)
```
We can also unpack these tuples directly in the loop:
```python
for k, v in d.items():
    print(f'{k} = {v}')
```

#### Order of Iteration
A common query is about the order in which keys and values are retrieved during iteration. Up to Python 3.4, the iteration order was not guaranteed. However, starting from Python 3.6, the insertion order is maintained. This means items are iterated in the order they were added to the dictionary:

- **Creating and Updating Entries**:
  ```python
  d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
  d['x'] = 24
  for k in d:
      print(k)
  d['b'] = 200
  for k, v in d.items():
      print(k, v)
  ```
  As seen here, updating a value does not affect the insertion order.

- **Deleting and Re-Inserting Keys**:
  ```python
  del d['b']
  for k, v in d.items():
      print(k, v)
  d['b'] = 200
  for k, v in d.items():
      print(k, v)
  ```
  Removing a key and then re-adding it changes its position to the end of the insertion order.

It's important to remember that while dictionaries maintain insertion order, there is no concept of positional order like in lists. We cannot insert an item at a specific position in a dictionary.
