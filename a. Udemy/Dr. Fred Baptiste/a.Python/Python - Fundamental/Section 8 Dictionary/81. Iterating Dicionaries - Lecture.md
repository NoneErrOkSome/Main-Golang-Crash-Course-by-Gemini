Iterating over a Python dictionary, which is also known as an associative array, is an important operation that allows you to traverse through all the keys and values in the dictionary.

1. **Iterating over keys:** The most straightforward way to iterate over a dictionary is to loop through its keys using a `for` loop. Here's how you can do this:

    ```python
    my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}

    for key in my_dict:
        print(key)
    ```

    This will output:

    ```rust
    name
    age
    city
    ```

    It's important to note that dictionaries in Python are unordered, so the order in which the keys are printed may vary.

2. **Iterating over values:** If you want to access the values directly, you can use the `.values()` method:

    ```python
    for value in my_dict.values():
        print(value)
    ```

    This will output:

    ```
    Alice
    25
    New York
    ```

3. **Iterating over items:** If you want to iterate over the keys and values at the same time, you can use the `.items()` method, which returns pairs of keys and values:

    ```python
    for key, value in my_dict.items():
        print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")
    ```

    This will output:

    ```
    Key: name, Value: Alice
    Key: age, Value: 25
    Key: city, Value: New York
    ```

These are the basic ways to iterate over a dictionary in Python. It's also possible to use dictionary comprehension, a powerful feature that allows you to create new dictionaries or lists based on existing dictionaries. However, for simplicity, we'll focus on the basic methods for now.

Iterating over dictionaries is a fundamental part of Python programming because it allows you to perform operations on each element in a dictionary, making it a critical operation for data manipulation and analysis.
