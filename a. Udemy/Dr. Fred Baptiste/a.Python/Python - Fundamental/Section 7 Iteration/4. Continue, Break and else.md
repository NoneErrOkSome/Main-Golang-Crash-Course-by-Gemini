In Python, `continue`, `break`, and `else` are control flow statements that you can use in loops to change the execution of your program.

1. **`continue`**: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.

    ```python
    for num in range(5):
        if num == 3:
            continue
        print(num)
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    0
    1
    2
    4
    ```
    In this example, when `num` is equal to `3`, the `continue` statement is executed and the `print(num)` line is skipped.

2. **`break`**: The `break` statement is used to stop the loop prematurely and immediately jump out of it.

    ```python
    for num in range(5):
        if num == 3:
            break
        print(num)
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    0
    1
    2
    ```
    In this example, when `num` is equal to `3`, the `break` statement is executed and the loop is immediately terminated.

3. **`else`**: The `else` clause in a loop is executed when the loop has finished iterating over the items (in a `for` loop) or when the condition becomes false (in a `while` loop), but not when the loop is prematurely stopped by a `break` statement.

    ```python
    for num in range(5):
        if num == 5:  # this condition is never true
            break
        print(num)
    else:
        print("Loop finished successfully.")
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    Loop finished successfully.
    ```

    In this example, because the `break` statement is never executed, the `else` clause is run after the loop finishes.

Using these control flow statements, you can create more complex and efficient loops in Python.
