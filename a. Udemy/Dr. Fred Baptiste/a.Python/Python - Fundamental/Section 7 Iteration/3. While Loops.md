The `while` loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The `while` loop is often used when the number of iterations is unknown or not specified ahead of time.

Here's a basic example:

```python
# Iteration with while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment the counter
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In this example, the loop continues as long as `count` is less than 5. Inside the loop, `count` is incremented by 1 on each iteration.

Just like the `for` loop, the `while` loop can also have an `else` statement. The block of code inside the `else` statement is executed once the condition in the `while` statement is false. Here's an example:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    print("The loop has ended.")
```

In this example, "The loop has ended." is printed after the `while` loop has finished executing.

Be careful when defining the condition for a `while` loop, as it's possible to create an infinite loop if the condition is always true. If you create an infinite loop in a Python script, you can usually interrupt it with Ctrl+C.

It's important to note that the `while` loop, like the `for` loop, does not create its own scope. This means that variables defined within a `while` loop are accessible outside of it as well.
