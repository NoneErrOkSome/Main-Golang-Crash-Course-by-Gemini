Certainly! Here are the two code snippets with comments indicating their expected output:

### First Code Snippet: Using `end = ' '`

```python
nested_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

for outer_list in nested_list:
    for inner_list in outer_list:
        print(inner_list, end = ' ')  # Prints each number followed by a space

# Expected Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```

In this snippet, the entire `nested_list` is printed on a single line. Each number from the nested lists is followed by a space, resulting in a continuous line of numbers.

### Second Code Snippet: Default `print` Behavior

```python
for outer_list in nested_list:
    for inner_list in outer_list:
        print(inner_list)  # Prints each number on a new line

# Expected Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
```

In this second snippet, each number from the nested lists is printed on its own line. After printing a number, `print` moves to the next line before printing the next number.

Both code snippets iterate over the same `nested_list`, but the way they print the numbers results in different formats of output, as indicated in the comments.

---
If you want to print all the numbers in the nested list from left to right (in a row), as opposed to top-down (each number on a new line), you can modify the loop to print on the same line. Use the `end` parameter in the `print` function to avoid moving to a new line after each print. Here's how you can do it:

```python
nested_list = [
			   [1, 2, 3], 
			   [4, 5, 6], 
			   [7, 8, 9]
			   ]

for inner_list in nested_list:
    for number in inner_list:
        print(number, end=' ')
    print()  # This print statement ensures each nested list starts on a new line
```

This code will print the numbers from left to right for each sublist and then move to a new line for each new sublist. The output will look like this:

```
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
```

No, loops in Python do not print indices by default. The behavior of a loop depends on how you write it. 

In Python, when you loop through a collection like a list, the loop typically accesses the elements of the collection directly, not their indices, unless you specifically write the loop to access indices.

### Looping Directly Over Elements

Here's an example of looping over elements:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]

for element in my_list:
    print(element)
```

In this case, `element` refers to the actual values in `my_list` (10, 20, 30), not their indices.

### Looping Over Indices

If you want to access the indices, you might use a loop like this:

```python
for index in range(len(my_list)):
    print(index)
```

Here, `index` will be the indices (0, 1, 2), not the elements of the list.

### Looping Over Both Indices and Elements

To access both indices and elements, you can use `enumerate`:

```python
for index, element in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f'Index: {index}, Element: {element}')
```

This will give you both the index and the element at that index.

In summary, whether a loop in Python accesses elements or indices depends on how the loop is constructed. By default, a standard `for` loop over a collection accesses the elements directly. If you need the indices, you would use `range(len(...))` or `enumerate`.

---
The issue in your code is with the expression `m(i)`. To access an element (in this case, a sublist) within the list `m`, you should use square brackets `[]` instead of parentheses `()`.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```python
m = [
    [0, 1],
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [10]
]

for i in range(len(m)):
    print(f"Row {i}:")
    for e in range(len(m[i])):
        print(m[i][e])
```

In this code:
- `m[i]` correctly accesses the sublist at index `i` in the list `m`.
- `m[i][e]` then accesses the element at index `e` within this sublist.

This code will print each element in each sublist, preceded by the row index.
