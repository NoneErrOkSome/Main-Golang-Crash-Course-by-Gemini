The `range()` function in Python is a built-in function that generates a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used in loops to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. 

The `range()` function can take one, two, or three parameters:

1. `range(stop)`: With one argument, `range()` generates a sequence of integers from `0` to `stop - 1`.

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    ```

2. `range(start, stop)`: With two arguments, `range()` generates a sequence of integers from `start` to `stop - 1`.

    ```python
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(i)
    # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    ```

3. `range(start, stop, step)`: With three arguments, `range()` generates a sequence of integers from `start` to `stop - 1`, incrementing by `step`. If `step` is negative, it generates a sequence in reverse order.

    ```python
    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
        print(i)
    # Output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

    for i in range(10, 0, -2):
        print(i)
    # Output: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
    ```

Note that `range()` generates numbers lazily, meaning it doesn't create all numbers at once but generates them on-the-fly as you iterate over them. This makes it memory efficient when dealing with large ranges.

Also, note that the `stop` value is always exclusive, meaning the sequence will go up to but not include this value.
