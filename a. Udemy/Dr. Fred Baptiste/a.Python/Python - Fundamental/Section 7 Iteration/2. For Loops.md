In Python, `for` loops are used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or dictionary) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.

Here's a basic example:

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Output:

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

Here, `fruit` is the loop variable that takes the value of the next element in the list for every iteration.

`for` loops can also iterate over a string:

```python
# Iterating over a string
for letter in 'Hello':
    print(letter)
```

Output:

```
H
e
l
l
o
```

And over a dictionary:

```python
# Iterating over a dictionary
dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
for key in dict:
    print(key, dict[key])
```

Output:

```
name John
age 25
city New York
```

Note: When iterating over a dictionary, the `key` variable takes on the value of the next key in the dictionary, and the corresponding value can be accessed with `dict[key]`.

The `for` loop also works with the `range()` function:

```python
# Iterating over a range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

This loop repeats 5 times, and the `i` variable takes on the value of the current loop count (from 0 to 4).

Nested `for` loops are also possible, where one `for` loop is inside another. This can be useful for iterating over nested data structures or for creating multidimensional loops (like a 2D loop for grid or matrix data).

Python's `for` loop is flexible and powerful, allowing you to traverse through various types of iterable objects in a straightforward and clear manner.
