The `mplfinance` library is an extension of Matplotlib that allows for the simple creation of financial charts, such as OHLC (open-high-low-close), candlestick, and volume charts. This package was originally a part of Matplotlib before it was split off as its own standalone library.

First, install it with pip:

```bash
pip install mplfinance
```

Next, import it along with pandas:

```python
import mplfinance as mpf
import pandas as pd
```

To use `mplfinance`, we typically start with financial data in a pandas DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex, and columns named 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and optionally 'Volume'.

Suppose we have this data saved in a CSV file called `SP500_NOV2019_Hist.csv`:

```csv
Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
2019-11-01,3050.72,3066.95,3050.72,3066.91,3506854351
2019-11-04,3080.80,3083.95,3074.87,3078.27,3511536476
2019-11-05,3080.80,3083.95,3074.87,3074.62,3489188168
2019-11-06,3075.10,3078.34,3065.89,3076.78,3520437181
2019-11-07,3087.02,3097.77,3080.23,3093.08,3720562166
...
```

You can read it into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('SP500_NOV2019_Hist.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
```

Finally, you can create an OHLC chart with:

```python
mpf.plot(df, type='ohlc')
```

You can change 'ohlc' to 'candle' or 'line' for a candlestick chart or line plot.

`mplfinance` also has many options for customizing and adding on to your financial chart, including volume overlays, moving averages, and more.

Please note that working with financial data involves many more complexities and details that are beyond the scope of this brief overview. Always make sure that your data is accurate and that your charts are correctly interpreting that data.
