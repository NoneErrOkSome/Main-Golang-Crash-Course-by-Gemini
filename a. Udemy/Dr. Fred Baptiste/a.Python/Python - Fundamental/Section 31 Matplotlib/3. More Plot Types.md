Beyond basic line and scatter plots, Matplotlib can create a variety of other plot types. Here are a few examples:

**Histograms:**

Histograms are a great tool for visualizing the distribution of data. The `plt.hist()` function can be used to create a histogram.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.random.randn(1000)

plt.hist(data, bins=30, alpha=0.5, color='steelblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.show()
```

**Boxplots:**

Boxplots can be created with the `plt.boxplot()` function. They are used to understand the spread and skewness of the data.

```python
data = np.random.randn(1000)

plt.boxplot(data, vert=False)
plt.show()
```

**Bar plots:**

Bar plots can be created using `plt.bar()`. They are used when we want to compare a single category of data between individual sub-items.

```python
labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
values = [3, 12, 5, 18, 45]

plt.bar(labels, values)
plt.show()
```

**Pie Charts:**

Pie charts can be created using `plt.pie()`. They show the proportion of each part of the data to the total.

```python
labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10, 22]

plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.show()
```

**Heatmaps:**

Heatmaps can be created using `plt.imshow()`. They are used to visualize data in 2D that is created by two variables, which are often times not related.

```python
matrix = np.random.rand(10, 10)

plt.imshow(matrix, cmap='hot', interpolation='none')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

These are just a few examples of the types of plots that can be created with Matplotlib. Other types of plots that can be created include error bars, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatter plots, etc. Each type of plot will have its own associated function call.
