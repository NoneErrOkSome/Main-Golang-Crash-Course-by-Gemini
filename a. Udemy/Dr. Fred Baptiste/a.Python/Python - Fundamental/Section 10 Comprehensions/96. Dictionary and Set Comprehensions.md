### Dictionary and Set Comprehensions

The syntax for a dictionary or a set comprehension is almost the same as for a list comprehension.

The difference is that we enclose the comprehension in `{}` instead of `[]`

The way Python differentiates between a dictionary comprehension vs a set comprehension is our use of either a single element in the comprehension, or a `key: value` pair.

Let's start with a simple dictionary comprehension.


```python
widget_sales = [
    {'name': 'widget 1', 'sales': 10},
    {'name': 'widget 2', 'sales': 5},
    {'name': 'widget 3', 'sales': 0}
]
```

We want to create a new dictionary that contains the name of the widget as the key, and the sales number as the value.

We could do it "traditionally" first:


```python
sales_by_widget = {}  # empty dict
for d in widget_sales:
    widget_name = d['name']
    sales = d['sales']
    sales_by_widget[widget_name] = sales
    
print(sales_by_widget)
```

We can re-write this slightly without temporary variables for `widget_name` and `sales`:


```python
sales_by_widget = {}  # empty dict
for d in widget_sales:
    sales_by_widget[d['name']] = d['sales']
    
print(sales_by_widget)
```

    {'widget 1': 10, 'widget 2': 5, 'widget 3': 0}
    

We could use a comprehension instead:


```python
sales_by_widget = {d['name']: d['sales'] for d in widget_sales}

print(sales_by_widget)
```

    {'widget 1': 10, 'widget 2': 5, 'widget 3': 0}
    

Furthermore, we could also filter out zero sales:


```python
sales_by_widget = {}  # empty dict
for d in widget_sales:
    if d['sales'] > 0:
        sales_by_widget[d['name']] = d['sales']
    
print(sales_by_widget)
```

    {'widget 1': 10, 'widget 2': 5}
    

Or, using a comprehension syntax:


```python
sales_by_widget = {d['name']: d['sales'] for d in widget_sales if d['sales'] > 0}

print(sales_by_widget)
```

    {'widget 1': 10, 'widget 2': 5}
    

Comprehensions are a very concise and readable syntax for generating new collections based on some other collection.

For example, let's try to solve the following problem.

Given a paragraph of text, we want to identify all the words of length 5 or more used in the paragraph.

For simplicity, we'll assume that the paragraph only contains alphanumeric characters as well as these punctuation marks: `,`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `:`, `-`, `--`, `\n`


```python
paragraph = """
To be, or not to be--that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
No more--and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to.
"""
```

There are better ways to do this, but for now we're going to use the tools we have at our disposal.

Since we don't really care about the punctuation characters, we're going to replace them with spaces:


```python
punctuation = ",.!:-\n"
```


```python
for char in punctuation:
    paragraph = paragraph.replace(char, ' ')
```


```python
paragraph
```




    " To be  or not to be  that is the question  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them  To die  to sleep   No more  and by a sleep to say we end The heartache  and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to  "



Next we are going to create a word list by splitting on spaces:


```python
all_words = paragraph.split()
```


```python
all_words
```




    ['To',
     'be',
     'or',
     'not',
     'to',
     'be',
     'that',
     'is',
     'the',
     'question',
     'Whether',
     "'tis",
     'nobler',
     'in',
     'the',
     'mind',
     'to',
     'suffer',
     'The',
     'slings',
     'and',
     'arrows',
     'of',
     'outrageous',
     'fortune',
     'Or',
     'to',
     'take',
     'arms',
     'against',
     'a',
     'sea',
     'of',
     'troubles',
     'And',
     'by',
     'opposing',
     'end',
     'them',
     'To',
     'die',
     'to',
     'sleep',
     'No',
     'more',
     'and',
     'by',
     'a',
     'sleep',
     'to',
     'say',
     'we',
     'end',
     'The',
     'heartache',
     'and',
     'the',
     'thousand',
     'natural',
     'shocks',
     'That',
     'flesh',
     'is',
     'heir',
     'to']



Finally, we have to create a list of unique words longer than 4 characters.

To get unique elements, we should use a set, but in addition we only want to retain the elements that have length at least 5 (greater than 4).


```python
words = {word for word in all_words if len(word) > 4}
```


```python
words
```




    {'Whether',
     'against',
     'arrows',
     'flesh',
     'fortune',
     'heartache',
     'natural',
     'nobler',
     'opposing',
     'outrageous',
     'question',
     'shocks',
     'sleep',
     'slings',
     'suffer',
     'thousand',
     'troubles'}



Although we have not encountered this problem here, we may not care about casing, in which case we may prefer doing this:


```python
words = {word.lower() for word in all_words if len(word) > 4}
```


```python
words
```




    {'against',
     'arrows',
     'flesh',
     'fortune',
     'heartache',
     'natural',
     'nobler',
     'opposing',
     'outrageous',
     'question',
     'shocks',
     'sleep',
     'slings',
     'suffer',
     'thousand',
     'troubles',
     'whether'}



Lastly let's look at another example where we start with a list of values, and we want to create a dictionary of all the unique elements in the list, with a count of how often they appear in the data.

Something like that can be useful if we are looking to create a frequency chart of occurrences in our data.


```python
data = ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'd']
```

We essentially want to create a dictionary that looks like this:


```python
freq = {
    'a': 3,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3,
    'd': 1
}
```

Let's try doing it this way:


```python
freq = {}
```


```python
for element in set(data):  # use set to create a set of just the unique elements
    # use a list comprehension to get a list of all the matching elements, 
    #  and count them up
    count = len([char for char in data if char == element])
    freq[element] = count
    
print(freq)
```

    {'d': 1, 'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    

This works just fine, but we could simplify this further using a dictionary comprehension as well:


```python
freq = {
    element: len([char for char in data if char == element])
    for element in set(data)   
       }
```


```python
freq
```




    {'d': 1, 'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}



This idea of creating a dictionary that contains all the unique "keys" from a collection, and a count for the corresponding value is one way of expressing mathematical multi-sets (sets where elements *can* repeat).

This is a common thing, and in fact Python's standard library provides a tool to do just that.

It is located in the `collections` module and is called a `Counter` object.

We can use it as follows:


```python
from collections import Counter
```


```python
freq = Counter(data)
```


```python
freq
```




    Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 1})



As you can see, we don't exactly have a dictionary - we have a `Counter` object, but it's very easy to transform it into a dictionary:


```python
dict(freq)
```




    {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 1}



We can use the same technique to get a frequency distribution of characters in a sentence.

For example, suppose we have this:


```python
paragraph = """
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud 
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure 
dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
mollit anim id est laborum."""
```


```python
freq = Counter(paragraph)
```


```python
freq
```




    Counter({'\n': 6,
             'L': 1,
             'o': 29,
             'r': 22,
             'e': 37,
             'm': 17,
             ' ': 67,
             'i': 42,
             'p': 11,
             's': 18,
             'u': 28,
             'd': 18,
             'l': 21,
             't': 32,
             'a': 29,
             ',': 4,
             'c': 16,
             'n': 24,
             'g': 3,
             'b': 3,
             'q': 5,
             '.': 4,
             'U': 1,
             'v': 3,
             'x': 3,
             'D': 1,
             'h': 1,
             'f': 3,
             'E': 1})



Of course, we're not really interested in characters such as `\n`, `,`, `.` and ` `.

We may not wish to differentiate between lower case and upper case characters.

In that case, we could do the following:


```python
ignored = " ,.\n"
```

First step is to create a counter on the case folded (or lower cased since we only have ascii characters here):


```python
freq = Counter(paragraph.casefold())
```


```python
freq
```




    Counter({'\n': 6,
             'l': 22,
             'o': 29,
             'r': 22,
             'e': 38,
             'm': 17,
             ' ': 67,
             'i': 42,
             'p': 11,
             's': 18,
             'u': 29,
             'd': 19,
             't': 32,
             'a': 29,
             ',': 4,
             'c': 16,
             'n': 24,
             'g': 3,
             'b': 3,
             'q': 5,
             '.': 4,
             'v': 3,
             'x': 3,
             'h': 1,
             'f': 3})



The next step is to filter out the unwanted keys:


```python
freq = {key: value for key, value in freq.items() if key not in ignored}
```


```python
freq
```




    {'l': 22,
     'o': 29,
     'r': 22,
     'e': 38,
     'm': 17,
     'i': 42,
     'p': 11,
     's': 18,
     'u': 29,
     'd': 19,
     't': 32,
     'a': 29,
     'c': 16,
     'n': 24,
     'g': 3,
     'b': 3,
     'q': 5,
     'v': 3,
     'x': 3,
     'h': 1,
     'f': 3}



And we can put all this together as follows:


```python
freq = {key: value 
        for key, value in dict(Counter(paragraph.casefold())).items()
        if key not in ignored}
```


```python
freq
```




    {'l': 22,
     'o': 29,
     'r': 22,
     'e': 38,
     'm': 17,
     'i': 42,
     'p': 11,
     's': 18,
     'u': 29,
     'd': 19,
     't': 32,
     'a': 29,
     'c': 16,
     'n': 24,
     'g': 3,
     'b': 3,
     'q': 5,
     'v': 3,
     'x': 3,
     'h': 1,
     'f': 3}



The thing about `Counter` objects is that they are very much like actual dictionaries, which means they also support the `.items()` method directly - we don't have to transform (cast) them to a dictionary first:


```python
freq = {key: value 
        for key, value in Counter(paragraph.casefold()).items()
        if key not in ignored}
```


```python
freq
```




    {'l': 22,
     'o': 29,
     'r': 22,
     'e': 38,
     'm': 17,
     'i': 42,
     'p': 11,
     's': 18,
     'u': 29,
     'd': 19,
     't': 32,
     'a': 29,
     'c': 16,
     'n': 24,
     'g': 3,
     'b': 3,
     'q': 5,
     'v': 3,
     'x': 3,
     'h': 1,
     'f': 3}
