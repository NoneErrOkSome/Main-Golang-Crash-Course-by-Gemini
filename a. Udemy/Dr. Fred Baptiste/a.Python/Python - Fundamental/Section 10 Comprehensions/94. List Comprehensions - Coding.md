### List Comprehensions

Let's see a few examples side by side of creating a list from an existing iterable using a "standard" approach vs a comprehension approach.

Given the following iterable of vectors, create a list that contains the magnitude of each vector.


```python
vectors = [(0,0), (0,1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
```


```python
from math import sqrt

magnitudes = []

for vector in vectors:
    magnitude = sqrt(vector[0] ** 2 + vector[1] ** 2)
    magnitudes.append(magnitude)
    
print(magnitudes)
```

    [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.4142135623730951]
    

Using a comprehension syntax instead, we can do all this in one single expression:


```python
magnitudes = [sqrt(vector[0] + vector[1]) for vector in vectors]
```


```python
magnitudes
```




    [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.4142135623730951]



As you can see, not only is the code more concise, but it is also "reads" very explicitly - far easier to understand the comprehension syntax.

It is also quite a bit more efficient in terms of computational speed.


```python
from time import perf_counter
```

`perf_counter` is something we can use to measure relative elapsed times.

It is a measure of elapsed time from some point of origin - this origin point is undefined, but we can get the `perf_counter` value at different points in our code, and calculate the difference between the different measuremenents.


```python
start = perf_counter()
for i in range(100_000):
    magnitudes = []
    for vector in vectors:
        magnitude = sqrt(vector[0] ** 2 + vector[1] ** 2)
        magnitudes.append(magnitude)
end = perf_counter()

elapsed_time = end - start
print(elapsed_time)
```

    0.359776093
    


```python
start = perf_counter()
for i in range(100_000):
    magnitudes = [sqrt(vector[0] + vector[1]) for vector in vectors]
end = perf_counter()

elapsed_time = end - start
print(elapsed_time)
```

    0.07221294499999997
    

As you can see, the comprehension approach was quite a bit faster.

The comprehension syntax also allows for an `if` clause to **filter** elements we want to include in the resulting list.

For example, suppose we have this collection of strings, and we want to create a new list that only retains strings that have at least `5` characters:


```python
strings = 'Python is an awesome language'.split(' ')
```


```python
strings
```




    ['Python', 'is', 'an', 'awesome', 'language']



We could use a "traditional" approach:


```python
filtered = []
for item in strings:
    if len(item) >= 5:
        filtered.append(item)
        
print(filtered)
```

    ['Python', 'awesome', 'language']
    

Or, we could use a comprehension instead:


```python
filtered = [item for item in strings if len(item) >= 5]

print(filtered)
```

    ['Python', 'awesome', 'language']
    

The iterable used in the comprehension can be any iterable, not just another list.

For example, suppose we have this dictionary that is maintaining a count fo each widget sold:


```python
sales = {
    'widget 1': 0,
    'widget 2': 5,
    'widget 3': 10,
    'widget 4': 2
}
```

We want to get a list of widgets that sold at least 5 items.

Again, we could approach it using the `append` approach (but remember that this is not as efficient as a comprehension):


```python
high_sales = []
for key in sales:
    if sales[key] >= 5:
        high_sales.append(key)
        
print(high_sales)
```

    ['widget 2', 'widget 3']
    

Of course, we could make this more Pythonic, by using `.items()` instead:


```python
high_sales = []
for key, value in sales.items():
    if value >= 5:
        high_sales.append(key)
        
print(high_sales)
```

    ['widget 2', 'widget 3']
    

But a better approach here, is a comprehension:


```python
high_sales = [key for key, value in sales.items() if value >= 5]

print(high_sales)
```

    ['widget 2', 'widget 3']
    

Let's go back to an example we saw earlier where we attempted to create a zero matrix this way:


```python
m = [[0] * 3] * 3
```


```python
m
```




    [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]



The problem was that we ended up with each row of the matrix being the **same** object:


```python
m[0][0] = 1
```


```python
m
```




    [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]



We can actually use comprehensions to fix this problem:


```python
m = [[0, 0, 0] for row in range(3)]
```


```python
m
```




    [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]




```python
m[0][0] = 1
```


```python
m
```




    [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]



We can even simplify this further:


```python
m = [[0] * 3 for row in range(3)]
```


```python
m
```




    [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]



Now what about creating an identity matrix - where all elements are `0`, except diagonal elements which are `1`?

Well, we could do it this way:


```python
m = [[0] * 3 for row in range(3)]

for row in range(3):
    for col in range(3):
        if row == col:
            m[row][col] = 1
            
print(m)
```

    [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
    

But we can actually use a comprehension to do all this.

Remember that the expression in a comprehension can be anything - including another comprehension!


```python
m = [ [1 if row == col else 0 for col in range(3)] for row in range(3)]
```


```python
m
```




    [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]



That syntax is starting to get a little harder to read - I would add some more formatting to make it more readable:


```python
n = 3

m = [
    [1 if row == col else 0 for col in range(n)]
    for row in range(n)
]
```


```python
m
```




    [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]



The important thing to understand is that the **inner** comprehension knows about `col` because that's the loop variable in that comprehension, but it also knows about the `row` variable in the enclosing comprehension - same as with nested loops.

So list comprehensions are mechanisms we can use to easily create a new list based on another iterable.

But comprehension syntax can quickly devolve into hard to understand messes - keep it simple!
