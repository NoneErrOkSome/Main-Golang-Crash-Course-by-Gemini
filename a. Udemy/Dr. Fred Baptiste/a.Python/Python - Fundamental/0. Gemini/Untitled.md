Of course. Here is a comprehensive guide to Python based on the "Python Fundamentals" course material you provided.

### Introduction to Python

This guide will introduce you to the Python programming language from first principles. You'll learn the fundamental concepts, explore some of the most common third-party libraries used for numerical computations and data analysis, and gain the knowledge needed to continue learning on your own1.

### Getting Started with Python

Before diving into code, it's essential to understand what Python is and how to set up your environment.

#### What is Python? üêç

Python is a high-level programming language, not a specific application2. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 and has since become a community-driven project3. The name was famously inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python4.

There are several implementations of Python, but the most widely used is **CPython**, which is considered the reference implementation. It's open-source and written in the C language5. When people refer to "Python," they are typically talking about CPython6.

#### Installation and Setup

1. **Install Python**: You'll need Python 3.6 or higher. You can download the official CPython distribution from **python.org**7777. The website provides installation packages for Windows and macOS8888.
    
2. **Virtual Environments**: It's a best practice to use virtual environments to manage project dependencies. A virtual environment is an isolated copy of a Python installation9999. This prevents conflicts between projects that might require different versions of the same library10. You can create one using the built-in `venv` module11:
    
    Bash
    
    ```Bash
    # For Mac/Linux
    python3 -m venv your_env_name
    # For Windows
    py -m venv your_env_name
    ```
    
3. **Activate the Environment**: Before using your environment, you need to activate it12:
    
    Bash
    
    ```Bash
    # For Mac/Linux
    source your_env_name/bin/activate
    # For Windows
    your_env_name\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
    
4. **Install Libraries with `pip`**: Third-party libraries (also called packages) add specialized functionality13. You can install them using **`pip`**, the package installer for Python14. The packages are downloaded from the Python Package Index (PyPI)15. It's crucial to activate your virtual environment _before_ installing packages16161616.
    
5. **`requirements.txt`**: To ensure consistency and reproducibility, you should list your project's dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file17. This file specifies the exact versions of the libraries needed18. You can install all the packages listed in this file with a single command19:
    
    Bash
    
    ```Bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

#### Running Python Code

You can run Python code in two main ways20:

- **Interactive Mode (REPL)**: This allows you to type and execute Python commands one by one and see the results immediately. You can start the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) by simply typing `python` in your activated terminal21. Jupyter Notebooks provide a more user-friendly, browser-based REPL experience22.
    
- **Script Mode**: You write your code in a `.py` file using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode. You then execute the entire script from the command line23232323:
    
    Bash
    
    ```Bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

### Python Basics

Here are the foundational elements of the Python language.

#### Basic Data Types

Python has several built-in data types to represent different kinds of values24.

- **Integers (`int`)**: Used for whole numbers like `100`, `-5`, and `0`. Python integers have exact precision and can be of any size, limited only by your computer's memory25.
    
- **Floats (`float`)**: Used for real numbers, such as `3.14` or `-0.01`26. It's important to know that floats are stored in binary and may not always be exact representations of decimal numbers. This can lead to small precision errors, so you should be careful when comparing floats for equality27272727.
    
- **Booleans (`bool`)**: Represents one of two values: **`True`** or **`False`**28. These are crucial for controlling the flow of your program.
    

#### Objects and Variables

**Everything in Python is an object**2929. An object is an entity that has both **state** (data) and **functionality** (methods)30303030. For example, an integer object has its numerical value as its state and functionality like addition31.

A **variable** is simply a name or a label that you assign to an object32. You use the assignment operator (`=`) for this33.

Python

```Python
# 'a' is a variable referencing an integer object
a = 100

# The reference can be changed to a different object
a = True
```

**Variable Naming Rules**34:

- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
- Can be followed by letters, numbers (0-9), or underscores.
- Cannot be a reserved keyword (like `if`, `def`, `for`).
- Names are case-sensitive (`my_var` is different from `My_Var`)35.
    

By convention, standard variable names use `snake_case` (all lowercase with underscores)36.

#### Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on values (operands)37.

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `**` (exponentiation)38. The `/` operator always returns a float39.
    
- **Integer Division (`//`) and Modulo (`%`)**:
    - `a // b` calculates the integer portion of the division (the floor)40.
        
    - `a % b` calculates the remainder of the division41.
        
- **Comparison Operators**: These compare two values and return a boolean (`True` or `False`). They include `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to)42.
    
- **Boolean Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not` are used to combine boolean expressions43. Python uses **short-circuit evaluation**:
    
    - For `a and b`, if `a` is `False`, `b` is not evaluated44.
        
    - For `a or b`, if `a` is `True`, `b` is not evaluated45.

### Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to execute code conditionally or repeatedly.

#### Conditional Execution

- **`if` statement**: Executes a block of code only if a condition is true46. Python uses **indentation** to define code blocks47.
    
- **`else` clause**: Provides an alternative block of code to run if the `if` condition is false48.
    
- **`elif` clause**: Stands for "else if" and allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence, which is more readable than nested `if` statements49494949.
    

Python

```Python
grade = 85
if grade >= 90:
    letter = 'A'
elif grade >= 80:
    letter = 'B'
else:
    letter = 'F'
print(letter) # Output: B
```

#### Ternary Operator

For simple conditional assignments, you can use the ternary operator for more concise code50505050.

Python

```Python
# Standard if-else
if a > b:
    max_val = a
else:
    max_val = b

# Ternary operator equivalent
max_val = a if a > b else b
```

#### Loops

- **`for` loops**: Used for **deterministic iteration**, meaning you iterate over a known set of items, like the elements of a sequence51515151.
    
- **`while` loops**: Used for **non-deterministic iteration**, where the loop continues as long as a certain condition remains `True`52525252.
    

Python

```Python
# for loop with a list
for name in ['Alice', 'Bob']:
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

# for loop with range()
for i in range(3):
    print(i) # Output: 0, 1, 2

# while loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
```

**Loop Control Statements**:

- `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one53.
    
- `break`: Exits the loop entirely54.
    
- `else` clause: A `for` or `while` loop can have an `else` block that executes only if the loop completes normally (i.e., without a `break` statement)55.

### Data Structures

Python offers a rich set of data structures for organizing and storing data.

#### Sequence Types

Sequences are ordered collections of objects, indexed starting from 056.

- **Lists (`list`)**:
    - **Mutable** (can be changed) and heterogeneous (can contain different data types)575757.
        
    - Defined with square brackets: `my_list = [10, "hello", True]`58.
        
    - Elements can be accessed, replaced, added, or removed595959595959595959.
        
- **Tuples (`tuple`)**:
    - **Immutable** (cannot be changed after creation) and heterogeneous6060.
        
    - Defined with parentheses (which are often optional): `my_tuple = (10, "hello", True)` or `10, "hello", True`61.
        
    - Because they are immutable, you cannot add, remove, or replace elements62626262.
        
- **Strings (`str`)**:
    - **Immutable** sequences of Unicode characters63.
        
    - Defined with single or double quotes: `'hello'` or `"hello"`64.
        

##### Slicing and Manipulation

**Slicing** extracts a portion of a sequence using the syntax `[start:stop:step]`656565. The `start` index is inclusive, and the `stop` index is exclusive66.

Python

```Python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
my_list[1:4] # -> [20, 30, 40]
my_list[::2] # -> [10, 30, 50] (gets every second element)
my_list[::-1] # -> [60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10] (reverses the list)
```

**Unpacking** allows you to assign elements of a sequence to multiple variables at once. This is a neat way to swap variable values67676767:

Python

```Python
a, b = 10, 20
a, b = b, a # Swaps the values; a is now 20, b is now 10
```

#### Dictionaries (`dict`)

Dictionaries are mutable collections of **key-value pairs**. They are incredibly important and widely used in Python686868.

- Keys must be unique and of a **hashable** type (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples). Mutable types like lists cannot be keys69.
    
- Values can be of any type70.
    
- Defined with curly braces: `person = {'name': 'Eric', 'age': 78}`71.
    
- You access values by their key, not by a positional index: `person['name']` returns `'Eric'`72.
    
- As of Python 3.6, dictionaries preserve the order in which items were inserted73.
    

#### Sets (`set`)

Sets are mutable, unordered collections of **unique, hashable** elements, just like a mathematical set74747474.

- Defined with curly braces: `unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}` results in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`75.
    
- They are highly efficient for membership testing (`in`) and for performing mathematical set operations like union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference (`-`)767676767676767676.
    
- To create an empty set, you must use `set()`, as `{}` creates an empty dictionary77.

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are fundamental to structuring your programs78.

#### Defining and Calling Functions

You define a function using the `def` keyword79.

Python

```Python
# A function with two parameters, 'a' and 'b'
def add(a, b):
    """This function returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

# Calling the function with arguments
result = add(5, 3) # result is 8
```

#### Function Arguments

Python offers flexible ways to pass arguments to functions:

- **Positional arguments**: Passed in order (`add(5, 3)`)80.
    
- **Keyword arguments**: Passed by name, order doesn't matter (`add(b=3, a=5)`)81.
    
- **Default values**: You can provide default values for parameters, making them optional82.
    
    `def greet(name, greeting="Hello"): ...`
- **Variable-length arguments**:
    - `*args`: Collects extra positional arguments into a tuple83.
        
    - `**kwargs`: Collects extra keyword arguments into a dictionary84.
        

#### Lambda Functions

A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It's limited to a single expression and is often used when a simple function is needed for a short period85.

Python

```Python
# A lambda function that adds two numbers
add = lambda a, b: a + b
add(5, 3) # -> 8
```

#### Higher-Order Functions

Functions are first-class objects in Python, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned from them. Functions that operate on other functions are called **higher-order functions**86.

- **`map(function, iterable)`**: Applies a function to every item of an iterable, returning an iterator87.
    
- **`filter(function, iterable)`**: Filters an iterable, keeping only the items for which the function returns `True`. It also returns an iterator88.
    
- **`sorted(iterable, key=function)`**: Sorts an iterable. The `key` function is used to generate a value for each element, and the sorting is based on these keys89898989.
    

#### Decorators

A decorator is a special kind of function that takes another function and extends its behavior without permanently modifying it. This is a form of metaprogramming that leverages closures90. The `@` syntax is used as a shorthand for applying a decorator91.

Python

```Python
# A simple decorator to log function calls
def log_function_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("World")
# Output:
# Calling function: say_hello
# Hello, World!
```

### Working with Data

Python's standard library and powerful third-party libraries make it excellent for data acquisition and manipulation.

#### Working with Files

The `open()` function is used to interact with files. It's best practice to use it within a **`with` statement** (a context manager), which ensures the file is automatically closed even if errors occur92929292.

Python

```Python
# Writing to a text file
with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, file!\n')

# Reading from a text file
with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
```

The `csv` module helps read and write data in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, handling various dialects and formatting complexities93.

#### JSON Data

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based standard for data interchange9494. Its structure is very similar to Python dictionaries and lists95. The `json` module is used for:

- **Deserialization** (decoding a JSON string into a Python object): `json.loads()`96969696.
    
- **Serialization** (encoding a Python object into a JSON string): `json.dumps()`97979797.
    

#### REST APIs

Many web services expose their functionality through **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces). **REST APIs** are a common type of web API that you can interact with over HTTP98989898. You send requests to specific URLs and often get data back in JSON format99. The `requests` library is the de facto standard in Python for making HTTP requests100.

### Key Third-Party Libraries

While the standard library is powerful, the Python ecosystem thrives on its vast collection of third-party libraries.

#### NumPy

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for scientific computing. Its core feature is the powerful N-dimensional array object, or `ndarray`101101101101.

- **Efficiency**: NumPy arrays are fixed-size, homogeneous (all elements of the same type), and stored more efficiently than Python lists, leading to much faster computations102102102102.
    
- **Vectorization**: NumPy allows you to perform operations on entire arrays at once (called vectorization), which pushes the loops down to the highly optimized C level, avoiding slow Python loops103.
    
- **Functionality**: It offers a vast library of mathematical functions, random number generation, linear algebra routines, and more104.
    

Python

```Python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# Vectorized operation - much faster than a Python for loop
c = a * b # -> array([10, 40, 90])
```

#### Pandas

**Pandas** is built on top of NumPy and is the go-to library for data manipulation and analysis105105105105. It introduces two primary data structures:

- **`Series`**: A one-dimensional labeled array, similar to a NumPy array but with an explicit index106106106106.
    
- **`DataFrame`**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types. You can think of it as a spreadsheet or a SQL table, or a dictionary of Series objects107107107107.
    

Pandas excels at loading data from various sources (like CSV or Excel files), cleaning and transforming it, handling missing values, and performing complex selection, filtering, and analysis tasks108.

#### Matplotlib

**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python109109109109. It provides fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot. The `matplotlib.pyplot` module is a collection of functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB110.
