### Python Set Operations

Python sets are akin to their mathematical counterparts, supporting several operations and methods. Here's an overview with examples:

1. **Checking for Disjoint Sets**:
   - Determine if two sets have no elements in common.
   ```python
   s1 = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
   s2 = {True, False}
   s3 = {'a', 100, 200}
   s1.isdisjoint(s2)  # Output: True
   s1.isdisjoint(s3)  # Output: False
   ```

2. **Adding Elements to Sets**:
   - Add an element using the `add()` method. Remember, sets only store unique elements.
   ```python
   s = set()  # an empty set
   s.add(100)
   s.add(200)
   s.add(100)  # Duplicate, will not be added
   # s: {100, 200}
   ```

3. **Removing Elements from Sets**:
   - `remove()` and `discard()` both remove elements. However, `remove()` raises a KeyError if the item is not present, while `discard()` does not.
   ```python
   s = set('abc')
   s.remove('a')  # 'a' is removed
   s.discard('x')  # Does nothing, 'x' is not present
   # s: {'b', 'c'}
   ```

4. **Subsets and Supersets**:
   - Use `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` to check for subsets and supersets.
   ```python
   s1 = set('abc')
   s2 = set('abcd')
   s1 < s2  # Output: True
   s1 <= s2 # Output: True
   s2 > s1  # Output: True
   s2 >= s1 # Output: True
   ```

5. **Union and Intersection**:
   - Use `|` for union and `&` for intersection.
   ```python
   s1 = set('abc')
   s2 = set('bcd')
   s1 | s2  # Union: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
   s1 & s2  # Intersection: {'b', 'c'}
   ```

6. **Practical Applications**:
   - Finding common or unique elements in strings or other collections.
   ```python
   str_1 = 'python is an awesome language!'
   str_2 = 'a python is also a snake.'
   set_1 = set(str_1)
   set_2 = set(str_2)
   set_1 & set_2  # Common characters
   ```

7. **Consolidating and Comparing Sets**:
   - Merging sets or finding differences.
   ```python
   s1 = {'FB', 'AMZN', 'AAPL'}
   s2 = {'BABA', 'WMT'}
   s1 | s2  # Consolidated set
   sold = {'w1', 'w2', 'w3'}
   returned = {'w1'}
   sold - returned  # Items sold but not returned
   ```

8. **Case Insensitive Character Set Comparison**:
   - Using case folding for case insensitive operations.
   ```python
   alphabet = set(string.ascii_letters.casefold())
   text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
   alphabet - set(text.casefold())  # Output: set() as all letters are used
   ```

These examples demonstrate the versatility of sets in Python for handling unique collections and performing set-theoretic operations.
