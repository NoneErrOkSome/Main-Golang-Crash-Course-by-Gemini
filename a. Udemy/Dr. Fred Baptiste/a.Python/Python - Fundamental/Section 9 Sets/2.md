In Python, the set data type supports a number of powerful and useful operations. As they are similar to mathematical sets, these operations include the standard mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Let's explore each operation in more detail.

1. **Union (`|` or `union()` method)**: The union of two sets is a set of all elements from both sets. Duplicates are excluded.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
print(set1 | set2)  # output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
# or
print(set1.union(set2))  # output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

2. **Intersection (`&` or `intersection()` method)**: The intersection of two sets is a set containing only items found in both sets.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
print(set1 & set2)  # output: {2, 3}
# or
print(set1.intersection(set2))  # output: {2, 3}
```

3. **Difference (`-` or `difference()` method)**: The difference of the set `A` from the set `B` (`A - B` or `A.difference(B)`) is a set of elements that are only in `A` but not in `B`.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
print(set1 - set2)  # output: {1}
# or
print(set1.difference(set2))  # output: {1}
```

4. **Symmetric Difference (`^` or `symmetric_difference()` method)**: The symmetric difference of two sets is a set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
print(set1 ^ set2)  # output: {1, 4}
# or
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))  # output: {1, 4}
```

5. **Subset (`issubset()` method)**: You can use this method to check if all elements of a set are present in another set.

```python
set1 = {1, 2}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(set1.issubset(set2))  # output: True
```

6. **Superset (`issuperset()` method)**: This method checks if all elements of another set are present in a set.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {1, 2}
print(set1.issuperset(set2))  # output: True
```

7. **Disjoint (`isdisjoint()` method)**: This method checks if two sets have no elements in common.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {4, 5, 6}
print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))  # output: True
```

These are some of the most common set operations available in Python. They can be incredibly useful when dealing with collections of items where the order of items does not matter, and you want to perform operations that involve grouping or separating items based on certain conditions.
