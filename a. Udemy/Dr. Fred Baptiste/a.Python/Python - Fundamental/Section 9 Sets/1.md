A Set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is akin to sets in mathematics. Here are some key properties and methods associated with Python sets.

1. **Unordered**: This means that the order in which items are added to a set is not preserved.

2. **Unique Items**: A set cannot have duplicate items. If we try to add a duplicate item to a set, Python simply ignores it.

3. **Mutable**: We can add or remove items from a set.

4. **Unindexed**: Since sets are unordered, we cannot access or change an element of a set using an index.

Let's take a look at some basic operations that you can perform with sets.

```python
# Declare a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)  # output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Declare a set with duplicate items
my_set = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3}
print(my_set)  # output: {1, 2, 3} as duplicate items are ignored

# Add an item to a set
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)  # output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Remove an item from a set
my_set.remove(6)
print(my_set)  # output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Here are some of the common methods associated with sets:

1. `add(element)`: Adds an element to the set.

2. `remove(element)`: Removes an element from the set. If the element is not present, it raises a KeyError.

3. `discard(element)`: Removes an element from the set if it is present.

4. `pop()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. If the set is empty, raises a KeyError.

5. `clear()`: Removes all elements from the set.

Sets also support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. For example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

print(set1.union(set2))  # output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
print(set1.intersection(set2))  # output: {4, 5}
print(set1.difference(set2))  # output: {1, 2, 3}
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))  # output: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```

Lastly, you can check if a set is a subset, a superset or disjoint with another set using the `issubset()`, `issuperset()`, and `isdisjoint()` methods, respectively.

Remember, because sets are unordered, you cannot predict which item will be popped when using the `pop()` method.
