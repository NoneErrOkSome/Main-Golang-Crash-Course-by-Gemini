String interpolation is a process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string. In Python, there are several ways to perform string interpolation:

1. **The "old way" - using the "%" operator** (similar to sprintf in C):

```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, %s" % name)  # Hello, Alice
```
For multiple variables, use a tuple:
```python
x, y = 10, 20
print("The values are: %d and %d" % (x, y))  # The values are: 10 and 20
```

2. **The "new way" - using the "str.format()" method**:

```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, {}".format(name))  # Hello, Alice
```
For multiple variables:
```python
x, y = 10, 20
print("The values are: {} and {}".format(x, y))  # The values are: 10 and 20
```
You can also refer to variables by index:
```python
x, y = 10, 20
print("The values are: {0} and {1}".format(x, y))  # The values are: 10 and 20
```

3. **Formatted string literals (f-strings)** - introduced in Python 3.6:

```python
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}")  # Hello, Alice
```
For multiple variables:
```python
x, y = 10, 20
print(f"The values are: {x} and {y}")  # The values are: 10 and 20
```
F-strings are not only more readable, concise, and less prone to error than other ways of formatting, but they are also faster.

In all these methods, you can include expressions inside the placeholders:
```python
x, y = 10, 20
print(f"x + y = {x + y}")  # x + y = 30
```
This can be particularly useful for debugging and for any case where you want to include the result of some code within a string.

The transcript you provided contains detailed information on various methods of string interpolation in Python. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Using the `format` Method**:
   - This method involves placing curly braces `{}` in a string as placeholders and then populating them with values using the `.format()` function.
   - Example: `"open: {}, high: {}, low: {}, close: {}".format(open_, high, low, close)`. Here, the values in `.format()` replace the `{}` in the order they appear.

2. **F-Strings (Formatted String Literals)**:
   - Introduced in Python 3.6, F-strings allow inline evaluation of expressions within a string.
   - To create an F-string, prefix the string with `f` or `F`, and then place variables or expressions in curly braces `{}` directly within the string.
   - Example: `f"bid: {bid}, ask: {ask}, spread: {ask - bid}"`. This method is more readable and less error-prone compared to concatenation or using the `format` method.

3. **Named Placeholders with `format`**:
   - You can use named placeholders within the curly braces and specify corresponding named arguments in the `.format()` method.
   - Example: `"bid: {b}, ask: {a}, spread: {spread}".format(a=ask, b=bid, spread=ask - bid)`. This approach makes the code more readable and doesnâ€™t rely on the order of arguments.

4. **Formatting with Precision**:
   - Both the `format` method and F-strings allow detailed control over formatting, like setting the number of decimal places.
   - Example using `.format()`: `"bid: {:.4f}, ask: {:.4f}".format(bid, ask)`.
   - Example using F-string: `f"bid: {bid:.4f}, ask: {ask:.4f}"`.

5. **Interpolation for Display Purposes**:
   - String interpolation is particularly useful for creating strings that are meant to be displayed to users, making it easy to incorporate variables and expressions within a text.
   - Python offers flexibility in how you interpolate strings, whether you're dealing with numeric data, dates, times, or other types of information.

In summary, string interpolation in Python can be achieved through the `format` method or the more modern F-strings. Both provide a way to create dynamic strings that incorporate variables and expressions. The choice between them can depend on readability preferences and specific formatting requirements.
