In Python, a Unicode string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode is a standard encoding system that is used to represent character from almost all languages. Each Unicode character is represented by a code point which is an integer between 0 and 0x10FFFF. Unicode strings are able to include characters from most languages in the same string.

**In Python 3, all strings are Unicode by default.** You can define a Unicode string in Python as follows:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
```

In this case, `my_string` is a Unicode string.

You can use special Unicode characters in your strings as well. To do this, you would use the '\u' escape sequence followed by the hexadecimal number representing the Unicode code point. For example:

```python
unicode_string = "Hello, World! \u2665"
print(unicode_string)
```

This will output: `Hello, World! ♥`. Here, `\u2665` represents the Unicode character for the heart symbol.

You can also use the `ord()` function to get the Unicode code point of a character, and `chr()` to get the character represented by a Unicode code point. For example:

```python
# Get the Unicode code point of a character
print(ord('♥'))  # Outputs: 9829

# Get the character represented by a Unicode code point
print(chr(9829))  # Outputs: ♥
```

Please note that handling Unicode can be complex due to issues such as normalization and encoding/decoding to/from bytes, but for simple use cases Python's built-in support is usually sufficient.
