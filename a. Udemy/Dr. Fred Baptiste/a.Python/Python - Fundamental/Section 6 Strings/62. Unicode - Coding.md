### Unicode

Here are the various links I used in the lecture:

- [`A`] https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0041
- [`Œ±`] https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+03B1
- [üêç] https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1F40D


We can get the (unicode) code point of any character, using the `ord()` function:


```python
ord('A')
```




    65




```python
ord('Œ±')
```




    945




```python
ord('üêç')
```




    128013



The `ord()` function returns the code point in decimal, but as we saw most Unicode tables use hex - a common base in computer science (along with binary, and, of course, decimal). Octal (base 8) is also sometimes used, but is less common.

To convert a decimal number into the corresponding hex **representation**, we can use the `hex()` function:


```python
hex(ord('A'))
```




    '0x41'




```python
hex(ord('Œ±'))
```




    '0x3b1'




```python
hex(ord('üêç'))
```




    '0x1f40d'



If you want to convert a hex number into decimal, you can do so using the `int()` function:


```python
int('3B1', 16)
```




    945



As long as your editor handles it, you can always paste in a glyph into a string, as we saw above, and even, in many cases as a variable name:


```python
Œ± = 'alpha'
```


```python
print(Œ±)
```

    alpha
    
Not all characters work for identifiers though - they must be letter-like or number-like symbols (such as letter or decimal number categories in Unicode). That's why you cannot use üêç as a variable name - it is in the "Other Symbol" category in Unicode.
So far we have seen that we can specify a character simply by pasting it into our editor (assuming it supports that, and assuming you have a font that can display the character).


```python
var = "A"
```

But we can also use the unicode name to define it, using an escape sequence.

For example, if we look at the unicode character `A`, we see that:

- name: Latin Capital Letter A
- code: U+0041

To use the name we use a `\N{...}` escape sequence:


```python
var = "\N{Latin Capital Letter A}lways look on the bright side of life."
```


```python
var
```




    'Always look on the bright side of life.'



We can also use the numeric code - in this case we have less than four digits in the code, so we use a `\uxxxx` escape sequence:


```python
var = "\u0041lways look on the bright side of life"
```


```python
var
```




    'Always look on the bright side of life'



Let's see another character - we'll search for "grin" in this web site: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode

The search result gets us to this page: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1F600

There we see that the character is:
- glyph: üòÄ
- name: Grinning Face
- code: U+1F600


```python
var = 'üòÄ'
var
```




    'üòÄ'




```python
var = "\N{Grinning Face}"
var
```




    'üòÄ'



The character code has 5 digits, so more than 4, and we therefore need to escape the code using `\Uxxxxxxxx` - an 8 digit code (padded with zeroes to the right if needed) - in this case `0001F600`:


```python
var = "\U0001F600"
var
```




    'üòÄ'



(Note the case difference `\uxxxx` and `\Uxxxxxxxx` for 4 vs 8 digit codes)


```python

```
