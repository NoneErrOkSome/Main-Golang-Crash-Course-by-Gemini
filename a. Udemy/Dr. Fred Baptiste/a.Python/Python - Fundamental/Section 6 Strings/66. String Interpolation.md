### String Interpolation

Often we want to "interpolate" values into strings.

Here I'll show you two mechanisms, the `format()` method and **formatted strings**, so called **f-strings**.


```python
open_, high, low, close = 98, 100, 95, 99
```

Note: I use `open_` instead `open` as a symbol because `open` is actually a built-in function in Python. Although we can redefine it, if we do so we won't be able to open files later :-)

Now, we want to generate a string that contains these values - maybe for display to our users, or maybe to save into a CSV file we are creating.

We can use the `format()` method this way:


```python
'open: {}, high: {}, low: {}, close: {}'.format(open_, high, low, close)
```




    'open: 98, high: 100, low: 95, close: 99'



The only thing is that we need to make sure we list the arguments in the same order as we are interpolating them into the string.

Now this may at times be prone to errors - in that case, there is a variant where we can name the argument in the string, and used named arguments in the `format` method (we'll get to named arguments later in this course):


```python
bid = 1.5760
ask = 1.5763
```


```python
'bid: {bid}, ask: {ask}, spread: {spread}'.format(bid=bid, ask=ask, spread=(ask - bid))
```




    'bid: 1.576, ask: 1.5763, spread: 0.00029999999999996696'



This is sometimes easier than remembering the order of the variables, because this works just as well:


```python
'bid: {bid}, ask: {ask}, spread: {spread}'.format(spread=(ask - bid), bid=bid, ask=ask)
```




    'bid: 1.576, ask: 1.5763, spread: 0.00029999999999996696'



You'll notice that the displayed value for the spread is a little too much (plus it's not exact, as we already know when dealing with floats). We can specify a format Python should use to display the float:


```python
'bid: {bid:.4f}, ask: {ask:.4f}, spread: {spread:.4f}'.format(spread=(ask - bid), bid=bid, ask=ask)
```




    'bid: 1.5760, ask: 1.5763, spread: 0.0003'



The other advantage of used named variables is that they can be used more than once in the same string:


```python
'{a} + {b} = {b} + {a}'.format(a=10, b=20)
```




    '10 + 20 = 20 + 10'



If we had wanted to use just positional arguments, we would have to do this:


```python
'{} + {} = {} + {}'.format(10, 20, 20, 10)
```




    '10 + 20 = 20 + 10'



Starting in Python 3.6, there is another way to do the same thing - f-strings.

These f-strings directly interpolate existing symbols into our string - this means they must exist before we define the f-string:


```python
a = 10
b = 20
```


```python
f'{a} + {b} = {b} + {a}'
```




    '10 + 20 = 20 + 10'



In fact, we can even include expressions, not just symbols in the interpolation:


```python
f'{a} + {b} = {a + b}'
```




    '10 + 20 = 30'



Let's go back to our open-high-low-close example:


```python
f'open: {open_}, high: {high}, low: {low}, close: {close}'
```




    'open: 98, high: 100, low: 95, close: 99'



And our spread example:


```python
f'ask: {ask}, bid: {bid}, spread: {ask - bid}'
```




    'ask: 1.5763, bid: 1.576, spread: 0.00029999999999996696'



As you can see we also have that visual representation issue, so we rectify it using the same approach as before:


```python
f'ask: {ask:.4f}, bid: {bid:.4f}, spread: {(ask - bid):.4f}'
```




    'ask: 1.5763, bid: 1.5760, spread: 0.0003'



Technically we don't even need the parentheses in the last interpolated expression:


```python
f'ask: {ask:.4f}, bid: {bid:.4f}, spread: {ask - bid:.4f}'
```




    'ask: 1.5763, bid: 1.5760, spread: 0.0003'




```python

```
