Python's `datetime` module provides the `strftime` method for formatting date and time objects into readable strings, as well as the `strptime` function for converting strings into date and time objects.

**strftime:**

The `strftime` method is used to create a string representation of a date, time, or datetime object. You pass it a format string that specifies how you want the date and time to be displayed.

Here are a few examples:

```python
from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()

# Format as 'yyyy-mm-dd'
print(now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))  # Output: '2023-06-15'

# Format as 'dd-mm-yyyy'
print(now.strftime('%d-%m-%Y'))  # Output: '15-06-2023'

# Format as 'Month Day, Year, hh:mm:ss'
print(now.strftime('%B %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S'))  # Output: 'June 15, 2023, 14:35:20'
```

Some of the common format codes are:

- `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number.
- `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%H`: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%M`: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%S`: Second as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%B`: Full month name.

**strptime:**

The `strptime` function is the opposite of `strftime`. It takes a string and a format string, and converts them into a `datetime` object.

Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_string = '2023-06-15'

# Convert the string into a datetime object
date = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d')

print(date)  # Output: 2023-06-15 00:00:00
```

In the above example, `datetime.strptime` takes the string '2023-06-15' and the format string '%Y-%m-%d', and returns a datetime object representing June 15, 2023.

These methods are powerful tools for customizing the representation of dates and times in your Python programs.
