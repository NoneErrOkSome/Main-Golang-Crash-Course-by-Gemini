In the context of the `datetime` module, Python distinguishes between two types of date and time objects: "naive" and "aware".

- **Naive**: A naive datetime object contains no timezone information and hence is not aware of daylight saving time. It's called naive because it's unable to tell the absolute time in real world. For example, "2023-06-15 13:45:30" is a naive time because we don't know which timezone this time refers to.

- **Aware**: An aware datetime object has enough information to locate itself relative to other aware datetime objects. It knows about timezones, daylight saving time, and other adjustments such as leap seconds.

**Creating naive datetime objects:**

When you create a date, time, or datetime object, it's naive by default.

```python
from datetime import datetime, date, time

# Naive datetime
dt = datetime(2023, 6, 15, 13, 45, 30)
print(dt)  # Output: 2023-06-15 13:45:30

# Naive date
d = date(2023, 6, 15)
print(d)  # Output: 2023-06-15

# Naive time
t = time(13, 45, 30)
print(t)  # Output: 13:45:30
```

**Creating aware datetime objects:**

To create an aware datetime object, you need to attach a `tzinfo` object, which represents timezone information. The `pytz` library is commonly used to work with timezones:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

# Aware datetime
dt = datetime(2023, 6, 15, 13, 45, 30, tzinfo=pytz.UTC)
print(dt)  # Output: 2023-06-15 13:45:30+00:00

# Or using a specific timezone
ny_tz = pytz.timezone('America/New_York')
dt = datetime(2023, 6, 15, 9, 45, 30, tzinfo=ny_tz)
print(dt)  # Output: 2023-06-15 09:45:30-04:00
```

Remember that operations between naive and aware datetime objects are not allowed to avoid ambiguous results. When comparing or doing arithmetic with datetime objects, make sure they are all naive or all aware.
