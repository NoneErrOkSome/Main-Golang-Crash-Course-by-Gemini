The `datetime` module in Python is used to deal with real dates and times. It provides classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways.

Here are some common classes and methods available in the `datetime` module:

**1. datetime.date**: This is an idealized naive date, assuming the Gregorian calendar always was, and always will be, in effect. Attributes: year, month, and day.

```python
import datetime

d = datetime.date(2023, 5, 22)
print(d)  # Output: 2023-05-22
```

**2. datetime.time**: This represents an idealized time, independent of any particular day, assuming that every day has exactly 24*60*60 seconds. Attributes: hour, minute, second, microsecond, and tzinfo.

```python
import datetime

t = datetime.time(12, 30, 45)
print(t)  # Output: 12:30:45
```

**3. datetime.datetime**: This combines a date and a time and is the most commonly used. Attributes: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, and tzinfo.

```python
import datetime

dt = datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 22, 12, 30, 45)
print(dt)  # Output: 2023-05-22 12:30:45
```

**4. datetime.timedelta**: This is used for manipulating dates and for expressing durations. You can add or subtract it from instances of `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, or `datetime.time`.

```python
import datetime

delta = datetime.timedelta(days=7, hours=2)
print(delta)  # Output: 7 days, 2:00:00

now = datetime.datetime.now()
new_date = now + delta
print(new_date)  # Output: The date and time 7 days and 2 hours from now
```

**5. datetime.timezone**: This is a class for timezone information objects. These are used by the datetime and time classes to provide a customizable notion of time adjustment (for example, to account for time zone and/or daylight saving time).

```python
import datetime

tz = datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=-5))
print(tz)  # Output: UTC-05:00
```

This is a high-level overview. Each of these classes has several methods for various uses, such as formatting dates and times in different ways, parsing dates and times from strings, comparing dates and times, and more.
