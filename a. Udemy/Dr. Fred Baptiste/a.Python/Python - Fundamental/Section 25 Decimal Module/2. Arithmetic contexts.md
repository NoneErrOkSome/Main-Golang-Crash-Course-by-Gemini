The Decimal module in Python supports arithmetic with a controllable precision and several rounding modes. This control is accomplished by setting what's known as a 'context'. This context determines the precision and rounding mechanisms for arithmetic with decimals.

First, you import the required functions:

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext, setcontext, Context
```

You can get the current context using the `getcontext()` function, and you can change it using the `setcontext()` function. A context is an instance of the `decimal.Context` class, and it has several attributes that control the precision and behavior of arithmetic operations:

```python
# Get the current context
ctx = getcontext()

# Print the current context
print(ctx)

# Output: Context(prec=28, rounding=ROUND_HALF_EVEN, Emin=-999999, Emax=999999, capitals=1, clamp=0, flags=[], 
# traps=[InvalidOperation, DivisionByZero, Overflow])
```

As you can see, the current context has a precision of 28 digits, and it uses the rounding mode `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`.

The precision is the maximum number of significant digits in the result of an operation:

```python
# Change the precision
getcontext().prec = 6

print(Decimal(1) / Decimal(7))

# Output: 0.142857
```

The `rounding` attribute determines the rounding mode. There are several rounding modes available:

- `ROUND_UP`: Round away from zero.
- `ROUND_DOWN`: Round towards zero.
- `ROUND_CEILING`: Round towards positive infinity.
- `ROUND_FLOOR`: Round towards negative infinity.
- `ROUND_HALF_UP`: Round to nearest with ties going away from zero.
- `ROUND_HALF_DOWN`: Round to nearest with ties going towards zero.
- `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`: Round to nearest with ties going to nearest even integer. This is also known as bankers' rounding and it's the default mode in Python.

For instance, to change the rounding mode:

```python
from decimal import ROUND_DOWN
getcontext().rounding = ROUND_DOWN

print(Decimal('7.325').quantize(Decimal('0.00')))

# Output: 7.32
```

You can also create your own context and use it for specific calculations:

```python
# Create a context with a precision of 2
ctx = Context(prec=2)

# Use the context
with setcontext(ctx):
    print(Decimal(1) / Decimal(7))

# Output: 0.14
```

In this case, the precision of 2 is only used within the `with` block. Outside the block, the default context is used.
