The Decimal module in Python is used for efficient and accurate floating-point arithmetic. The `decimal` module provides support for fast correctly rounded decimal floating point arithmetic. The Decimal class in this module is especially useful for financial and monetary calculations.

To use it, you first need to import the decimal module:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
```

The Decimal is a floating decimal point type. It has a floating decimal point which means the decimal point can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of a number. 

For example, in the number 123.45, the decimal point is placed after the second digit, while in the number 0.012345, the decimal point is placed at the start. 

The decimal module provides arithmetic with as much precision as needed:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

# Create a Decimal object
x = Decimal(3.14)

# another Decimal object
y = Decimal(2.74)

# perform a decimal precision operation
print(x * y)
```

In addition to its precision, another advantage of using the Decimal class instead of the float in Python is that it provides more functions and handles more complex operations. For example, you can specify the rounding mode, check if a number is finite or infinite, or adjust the precision of calculations.

You can create a Decimal object from integers, strings, floats, or tuples. However, it's usually best to create Decimal objects from strings or tuples to avoid the approximation issues of binary floating point numbers:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

# decimal from string
x = Decimal('0.1')

# decimal from tuple
y = Decimal((0, (3, 1, 4), -2))

print(x)
print(y)
```

You can control the precision of all decimal operations by using a special context object:

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# set the precision
getcontext().prec = 4

a = Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)
print(a)  # 0.1429
```

Please note that the decimal module also supports a variety of mathematical operations like square root, exponentiation, logarithm, cosine, etc. However, these operations are not as fast as the operations on floats, and they are also not as fast as the operations provided by libraries like numpy for large arrays of numbers.
