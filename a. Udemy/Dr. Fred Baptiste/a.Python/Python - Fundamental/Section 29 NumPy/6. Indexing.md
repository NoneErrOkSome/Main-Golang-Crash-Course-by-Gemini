In NumPy, indexing is a way to access specific elements in an array. The indexing works quite similar to Python's standard list indexing. Indexing in NumPy can be done in multiple ways.

1. **Integer Indexing**: This is the most basic way to index an array, which works just like indexing a list in Python. Here is an example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Access the element at index 2
print(arr[2])  # Output: 3
```

2. **Slice Indexing**: Similar to lists, you can slice a NumPy array to get a range of values:

```python
# Get the elements at indices 1 to 3
print(arr[1:4])  # Output: [2 3 4]
```

3. **Boolean Indexing**: This is a powerful indexing method which allows you to select elements based on conditions:

```python
# Get all elements in arr greater than 2
print(arr[arr > 2])  # Output: [3 4 5]
```

4. **Fancy Indexing**: This is just a term adopted by NumPy to describe integer array indexing. Fancy indexing allows you to access multiple array elements at once:

```python
# Create an array
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90])

# Fancy indexing
indices = np.array([1, 3, 5])
print(arr[indices])  # Output: [20 40 60]
```

In a multidimensional array, you can also index elements. Here's an example for a 2D array:

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]])

# Access the element at row 1 column 2
print(arr[1, 2])  # Output: 6
```

Similarly, you can use slicing, boolean indexing, and fancy indexing in multidimensional arrays as well.
