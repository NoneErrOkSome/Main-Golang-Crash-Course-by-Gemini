NumPy provides a rich set of mathematical and statistical functions that you can apply to arrays. Here are some additional examples:

1. **Math functions**: Beyond basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), NumPy includes functions for more complex mathematical operations:

   - Power: Raises each element in an array to a specified power.

     ```python
     import numpy as np

     arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
     print(np.power(arr, 2))  # Output: [ 1  4  9 16 25]
     ```

   - Logarithm: Computes the natural logarithm, base-2 logarithm, and base-10 logarithm of each element in an array.

     ```python
     print(np.log(arr))       # natural logarithm
     print(np.log2(arr))      # base-2 logarithm
     print(np.log10(arr))     # base-10 logarithm
     ```

   - Trigonometric: Computes the sine, cosine, and tangent of each element in an array.

     ```python
     print(np.sin(arr))       # sine
     print(np.cos(arr))       # cosine
     print(np.tan(arr))       # tangent
     ```

2. **Statistical functions**: NumPy provides functions to calculate statistics of arrays:

   - Mean: Computes the arithmetic mean along a specified axis.

     ```python
     print(np.mean(arr))      # Output: 3.0
     ```

   - Median: Computes the median along a specified axis.

     ```python
     print(np.median(arr))    # Output: 3.0
     ```

   - Standard deviation and variance: Compute the standard deviation and variance along a specified axis, respectively.

     ```python
     print(np.std(arr))       # standard deviation
     print(np.var(arr))       # variance
     ```

   - Min and max: Identify the minimum and maximum values along a specified axis.

     ```python
     print(np.min(arr))       # minimum
     print(np.max(arr))       # maximum
     ```

   - Sum and product: Compute the sum and product of array elements over a given axis.

     ```python
     print(np.sum(arr))       # sum
     print(np.prod(arr))      # product
     ```

Remember that many of these functions can take an `axis` argument to compute the operation along a specific axis for a multi-dimensional array. For example, `np.mean(arr, axis=0)` will compute the mean of `arr` along the first axis.
