Universal functions (also known as ufuncs) in NumPy are functions that operate element-wise on arrays. They are the key to NumPy's ability to perform fast mathematical operations. Universal functions in NumPy are highly optimized and provide a flexible way to perform mathematical operations on arrays.

There are many universal functions available in NumPy, and they fall mainly into two categories: unary ufuncs, which operate on a single input, and binary ufuncs, which operate on two inputs.

Here are some examples of common universal functions:

1. **Unary ufuncs**:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Compute the square root of each element
print(np.sqrt(arr))  # Output: [1.         1.41421356 1.73205081 2.         2.23606798]

# Compute the exponential of each element
print(np.exp(arr))  # Output: [  2.71828183   7.3890561   20.08553692  54.59815003 148.4131591 ]
```

2. **Binary ufuncs**:

```python
# Create two arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Add the elements of arr1 and arr2
print(np.add(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [ 7  9 11 13 15]

# Compute the maximum element-wise between arr1 and arr2
print(np.maximum(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [ 6  7  8  9 10]
```

Note that these functions return a new array and do not modify the original arrays. Furthermore, they can be used with broadcasting, which means they can handle arrays of different shapes in a sensible way. For instance, you can easily add a scalar (a zero-dimensional array) to an array:

```python
# Add 1 to each element of arr
print(np.add(arr, 1))  # Output: [2 3 4 5 6]
```

This flexibility makes universal functions a powerful tool for performing mathematical operations on NumPy arrays.
