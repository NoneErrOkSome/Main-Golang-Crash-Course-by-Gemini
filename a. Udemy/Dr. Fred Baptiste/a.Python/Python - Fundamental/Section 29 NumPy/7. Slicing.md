Slicing in NumPy is a way to extract a range of elements from an array, similar to how you slice lists in Python. It works by specifying a start index, an end index, and an optional step index.

Here is the basic syntax:

```python
# Array slicing syntax
arr[start:stop]  # items start through stop-1
arr[start:]      # items start through the rest of the array
arr[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1
arr[:]           # a copy of the whole array
```

You can also specify a step value, which is the difference between each index in the slice:

```python
arr[start:stop:step]  # start through not past stop, by step
```

Here are some examples:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Slice elements from index 1 to index 5
print(arr[1:5])  # Output: [2 3 4 5]

# Slice elements from the beginning to index 4
print(arr[:4])  # Output: [1 2 3 4]

# Slice elements from index 4 to the end of the array
print(arr[4:])  # Output: [5 6 7 8 9]

# Slice elements from the beginning to the end with a step of 2
print(arr[::2])  # Output: [1 3 5 7 9]
```

In a multidimensional array, you can slice along each dimension independently. Here's an example for a 2D array:

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]])

# Slice all rows and the first 3 columns
print(arr[:, :3])
# Output:
# [[ 1  2  3]
#  [ 6  7  8]
#  [11 12 13]]
```

In this example, `:` selects all rows and `:3` selects the first 3 columns. Thus, the slice includes all the elements at the intersection of these rows and columns.
