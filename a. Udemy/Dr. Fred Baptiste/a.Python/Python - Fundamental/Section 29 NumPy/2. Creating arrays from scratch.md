There are several functions provided by NumPy to create arrays from scratch. Here are some of them:

1. `np.zeros(shape)`: This creates an array filled with zeros. The shape is a tuple specifying the dimensions of the array.

```python
import numpy as np

zeros = np.zeros((3, 3))
print(zeros)
# Output:
# array([[0., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 0.]])
```

2. `np.ones(shape)`: This creates an array filled with ones. The shape is a tuple specifying the dimensions of the array.

```python
ones = np.ones((3, 3))
print(ones)
# Output:
# array([[1., 1., 1.],
#        [1., 1., 1.],
#        [1., 1., 1.]])
```

3. `np.full(shape, fill_value)`: This creates an array filled with the provided fill value. The shape is a tuple specifying the dimensions of the array.

```python
full = np.full((3, 3), 7)
print(full)
# Output:
# array([[7, 7, 7],
#        [7, 7, 7],
#        [7, 7, 7]])
```

4. `np.eye(N)`: This creates a 2D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere (identity matrix).

```python
eye = np.eye(3)
print(eye)
# Output:
# array([[1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 1., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 1.]])
```

5. `np.arange(start, stop, step)`: This creates an array with regularly incrementing values between start and stop, with the step size.

```python
arange = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # From 0 to 10(exclusive) with step size 2
print(arange)
# Output: array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
```

6. `np.linspace(start, stop, num)`: This creates an array with num evenly spaced points between start and stop.

```python
linspace = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  # 5 values evenly spaced between 0 and 1
print(linspace)
# Output: array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ])
```

7. `np.random.random(shape)`: This creates an array with the given shape filled with random values between 0 and 1.

```python
random = np.random.random((3, 3))  # 3x3 array of random values between 0 and 1
print(random)
```

8. `np.random.randint(low, high, size)`: This creates an array of the given shape with random integers between low (inclusive) and high (exclusive).

```python
random_int = np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))  # 3x3 array with random integers between 0 and 10
print(random_int)
```

Remember that these are just some of the ways to create arrays using NumPy. There are many other functions available, which you can find in the NumPy documentation.
