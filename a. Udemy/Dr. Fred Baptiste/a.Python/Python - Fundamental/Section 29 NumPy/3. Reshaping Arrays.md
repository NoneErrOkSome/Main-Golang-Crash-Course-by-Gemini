The shape of an existing array can be changed given that the new shape should be compatible with the original shape. For example, you can reshape a 1D array into a 2D array (a matrix), or you can reshape a 1D array into a 3D array (a cube), etc.

The most common reshaping operation is converting a 1D array into a 2D array, or vice versa.

Here is how you can do that in NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr = np.arange(1, 10)
print("Original array:")
print(arr)

# Now reshape it to a 2D array of shape (3, 3)
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape((3, 3))
print("\nReshaped array:")
print(reshaped_arr)
```

In this example, the original 1D array has 9 elements, so we can reshape it to any new shape that has 9 elements as well. Here we chose the new shape to be (3, 3), so the 1D array was reshaped to a 2D array with 3 rows and 3 columns.

Note: The reshape operation creates a view on the original array, which means that the original array's shape is not changed, but the reshaped array shares the same data.

Sometimes, you might not know the size of one of the dimensions and you'd like NumPy to calculate it for you. You can use -1 for this. For example:

```python
arr = np.arange(1, 10)
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape((3, -1))
```

In this example, we specified the shape as (3, -1), which means that the reshaped array will have 3 rows and the number of columns will be calculated automatically by NumPy (which will be 3 in this case).

Lastly, it's also possible to flatten a multi-dimensional array back to a 1D array using the `flatten()` or `ravel()` function:

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Flatten the array
flattened_arr = arr.flatten()
print(flattened_arr)
# Output: array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```

Here, `flatten()` and `ravel()` have the same effect. The difference between the two is that `flatten()` returns a copy of the original array while `ravel()` returns a view.
