Stacking in NumPy is a way to combine existing arrays to create a bigger array. There are two types of stacking in NumPy: horizontal stacking and vertical stacking. 

1. **Horizontal Stacking:** This stacks the arrays in a sequence horizontally (column-wise).

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two 1D arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Horizontal stacking
h_stack = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))
print(h_stack) 
# Output: array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```

2. **Vertical Stacking:** This stacks the arrays in a sequence vertically (row-wise).

```python
# Vertical stacking
v_stack = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))
print(v_stack)
# Output: 
# array([[1, 2, 3],
#        [4, 5, 6]])
```

For 2D arrays, `hstack` and `vstack` are equivalent to concatenation along the second and first axis, respectively.

```python
# Create two 2D arrays
arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
arr2 = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])

# Horizontal stacking
h_stack = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))
print(h_stack)
# Output: 
# array([[ 1,  2,  3,  7,  8,  9],
#        [ 4,  5,  6, 10, 11, 12]])

# Vertical stacking
v_stack = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))
print(v_stack)
# Output: 
# array([[ 1,  2,  3],
#        [ 4,  5,  6],
#        [ 7,  8,  9],
#        [10, 11, 12]])
```

You can also use the `np.concatenate()` function with an appropriate axis parameter to achieve similar results. For instance, `np.concatenate([arr1, arr2], axis=0)` would be equivalent to `np.vstack([arr1, arr2])`, and `np.concatenate([arr1, arr2], axis=1)` would be equivalent to `np.hstack([arr1, arr2])`.
