Fancy indexing is a term adopted by NumPy to describe indexing using integer arrays. Fancy indexing allows you to access and modify complicated patterns of data in a NumPy array beyond what normal slicing allows.

Here is an example of fancy indexing:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Define an array of indices
indices = np.array([1, 3, 5])

# Use fancy indexing to access elements at these indices
print(arr[indices])  # Output: [1 3 5]
```

Fancy indexing can be used in multiple dimensions. Here's an example for a 2D array:

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr = np.array([[0, 1, 2],
                [3, 4, 5],
                [6, 7, 8],
                [9, 10, 11]])

# Define arrays of indices for each dimension
row_indices = np.array([1, 2])
col_indices = np.array([0, 2])

# Use fancy indexing to access elements at these indices
print(arr[row_indices, col_indices])  # Output: [3 8]
```

In this example, the elements `arr[1, 0]` and `arr[2, 2]` are selected. Fancy indexing returns a new array and does not modify the original array.

You can also use fancy indexing to modify parts of an array:

```python
# Create an array
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Define an array of indices
indices = np.array([1, 3, 5])

# Use fancy indexing to modify elements at these indices
arr[indices] = 99

print(arr)  # Output: [0 99 2 99 4 99 6 7 8 9]
```

In this example, the elements at indices 1, 3, and 5 have been changed to 99.
