Python provides several ways to import modules and their components, depending on the specific needs of your program. Here are some of the most common variants:

**1. Importing a module**

```python
import math
```
In this case, you import the entire `math` module. To access functions or variables in the module, use the dot notation, as in `math.pi` or `math.sqrt()`.

**2. Importing a module with a different name**

```python
import math as m
```
This imports the `math` module, but gives it the alias `m`. This can be useful if you're working with modules that have long or conflicting names.

**3. Importing specific functions or variables from a module**

```python
from math import pi, sqrt
```
This imports only `pi` and `sqrt` from the `math` module. You can then use these directly without the module prefix.

**4. Importing all functions and variables from a module**

```python
from math import *
```
This imports all functions and variables from the `math` module. Be careful with this approach, because it can lead to name conflicts if different modules have functions or variables with the same name.

**5. Importing a package**

Packages in Python are directories that contain multiple package modules. For example:

```python
import numpy
```
This would import the `numpy` package, and to access its modules, you would use dot notation, like `numpy.array()`.

**6. Importing a module from a package**

You can also import a specific module from a package:

```python
from numpy import array
```
This imports the `array` module from the `numpy` package.

**7. Importing a module from a package with a different name**

You can also import a specific module from a package with a different name:

```python
from numpy import array as arr
```
This imports the `array` module from the `numpy` package but gives it the alias `arr`.

Remember to follow good practices when importing modules. Avoid importing everything with `*` as it can make your code harder to read and understand, and can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, only import what you need and use aliases to avoid naming conflicts.
