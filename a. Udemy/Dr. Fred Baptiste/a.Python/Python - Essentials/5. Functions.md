Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the fundamentals of functions in Python, including defining functions, function arguments and return values, and lambda functions.

### 5. Functions

Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, improving readability, and reducing redundancy.

#### Defining Functions

To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()` which may include parameters. The body of the function is indented.

**Syntax:**
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    # Code to execute
    return value # Optional
```

**Example:**
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In this example, `greet` is a simple function that takes one parameter (`name`) and prints a greeting message.

#### Function Arguments and Return Values

**Arguments/Parameters:**

- **Positional Arguments:** These are arguments that need to be included in the proper position during the function call.
  
  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y

  result = add(3, 5)  # Output: 8
  ```

- **Keyword Arguments:** These are arguments where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
  
  ```python
  def introduce(name, age):
      print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

  introduce(age=30, name="Bob")
  ```

- **Default Arguments:** You can provide default values for parameters. If an argument for such a parameter is not provided during the call, its default value will be used.
  
  ```python
  def greet(name="Guest"):
      print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  greet()          # Output: Hello, Guest!
  greet("Alice")   # Output: Hello, Alice!
  ```

- **Variable-length Arguments:** Sometimes you may not know beforehand how many arguments will be passed to your function. You can use `*args` for non-keyword variable-length arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword variable-length arguments.
  
  ```python
  def sum_all(*args):
      return sum(args)

  result = sum_all(1, 2, 3)   # Output: 6

  def print_info(**kwargs):
      for key, value in kwargs.items():
          print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Alice", age=25)
```

**Return Values:**

A function can return data back to where it was called using the `return` statement.

```python
def square(number):
    return number * number

result = square(4)   # result will be assigned with value:16 
```

If no `return` statement is used or if it's executed without an expression after it (just `return`), then by default it returns `None`.

#### Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the keyword `lambda`. They can have any number of input parameters but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned.

**Syntax:**
```python
lambda parameters: expression
```

Lambda functions are often used when you need a simple function for a short period (like as an argument to another higher-order function).

**Example:**
```python
# Regular Function:
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Lambda Function:
add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y

print(add_lambda(3,4))   # Output :7 

# Using lambda with map() 
numbers = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4]
squared = list(map(lambda x : x* x,numbers))
print(squared)   #Output :[1 ,4 ,9 ,16]
```
In this example above both regular & lambda performs same addition operation . The map() example shows how lambdas can be useful when working within context other higher order functions .

These fundamental concepts around defining & using different types/functions along side basic examples should give clarity on how they work together .
