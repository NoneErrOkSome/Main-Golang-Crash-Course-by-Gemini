explain GCF and LCM pls with latex by using double dollars sign for new line and single dollar sign for inline.

Example: inline: $(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, \text{and } 12)$
Example: newline 
$$
\text{GCF}(12, 18) = 6
$$


Sure! Let's explain the concepts of Greatest Common Factor (GCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) using LaTeX for mathematical notation.

### Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

The Greatest Common Factor, also known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), of two or more integers is the largest integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder.

**Example:**

Consider the numbers 12 and 18. To find their GCF, we first list out their factors:

- Factors of 12: $(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, \text{and } 12)$
- Factors of 18: $(1, 2, 3, \text{and } 9)$

The common factors are $(1, 2, \text{and } 3)$.

Thus, the GCF of 12 and 18 is:
$$
\text{GCF}(12, 18) = \max(1, 2, \text{and }3) = 6
$$

### Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The Least Common Multiple of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.

**Example:**

Consider the same numbers: 12 and 18. To find their LCM, we can list out their multiples until we find a common one:

- Multiples of 12: $12, 24, \mathbf{36}, ...$
- Multiples of 18: $18, \mathbf{36}, ...$

The smallest common multiple is $36$.

Thus, the LCM of 12 and 18 is:
$$
\text{LCM}(12, 18) = \min(36)
$$

Alternatively, you can calculate GCF and LCM using prime factorization:

For example:
- Prime factorization of $12$: $2^2 \times 3$
- Prime factorization of $18$: $2 \times {3^2}$

Using these factorizations:
- **GCF** is found by taking the lowest power for each common prime factor:
$$
\text{GCF}(12,18) = {2^1} \times {3^1} = {6}
$$

- **LCM** is found by taking the highest power for each prime factor present in either number:
$$
\text{LCM}(12,18) = {2^2} \times {3^2} = {36}
$$

This way you can understand both concepts with examples in LaTeX notation.
