How to create angular project?

 To create an Angular project, you need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your system. Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install Node.js
- Go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Download and install the latest version of Node.js for your operating system. This will also install npm (Node package manager), which is required for installing Angular CLI.

### Step 2: Install Angular CLI
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to install Angular CLI globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

### Step 3: Create a New Angular Project
- Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
- Use the following command to create a new Angular project:

  ```bash
  ng new project-name
  ```

  Replace `project-name` with your desired project name.

### Step 4: Navigate into Your Project Directory
- Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory using:

  ```bash
  cd project-name
  ```

### Step 5: Serve Your Application
- To run your new Angular application, use the command:

  ```bash
  ng serve
  ```

- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/`. You should see your new Angular app running.

These steps will help you set up a basic Angular project. The `ng serve` command compiles your application and opens it in a web server for development purposes. You can edit files in the `src` folder, and changes should automatically reflect in your browser thanks to live reloading.
