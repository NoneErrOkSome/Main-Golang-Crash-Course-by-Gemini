Of course. Here is a shortened, arrow-based summary of how Angular renders its content:

index.html is loaded by the browser with an empty <app-root></app-root> tag.

→

The Angular CLI injects compiled JavaScript (<script> tags) into index.html.

→

The browser executes these scripts, running the code in main.ts first.

→

main.ts calls the bootstrapApplication(AppComponent) function.

→

Angular starts and reads the @Component decorator metadata from AppComponent.

→

Angular sees the selector: 'app-root' and finds the <app-root> tag in index.html.

→

Angular injects the component's HTML from its templateUrl into the <app-root> tag.

→

The user sees the fully rendered component.
