Absolutely — here’s **Part 4: Modern Units — `vh`, `vw`, and Better Ways to Size Elements**, rewritten in my own words but still grounded in the ideas hinted at in the transcript. These units weren’t fully introduced in the lecture yet, but since they were teased, this part will naturally extend that by explaining what’s coming — clearly and progressively.

## 🧱 Part 4: Modern CSS Units — Skip the Chains and Think in Viewports

### 🎯 Objective:

Learn about **viewport-based units** like `vh` and `vw`, and how they let you size elements **relative to the screen**, without needing the full “height chain” from `html` to `body` to `main`.

---

### 📐 Problem Recap:

Earlier, we saw that using `height: 100%` **requires setting 100% height on all parent elements** — `html`, `body`, `main`, etc. Without that chain, the child element has **no reference point**, and the layout breaks or becomes unpredictable.

That’s clunky. It works, but it’s easy to mess up.

---

### 🌐 Step 1: What Is the Viewport?

The **viewport** is basically the visible part of your browser window.

- If you resize the window, the viewport changes.
    
- On mobile, it's the screen size without browser UI (like address bars).

### 📏 Step 2: The `vh` and `vw` Units

These are **viewport-relative units**, and they solve a lot of layout problems.

|Unit|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`1vh`|1% of the **viewport height**|
|`1vw`|1% of the **viewport width**|
|`100vh`|Full height of the visible screen|
|`100vw`|Full width of the visible screen|

💡 You can use these **without setting heights on parents**. They **ignore the element hierarchy** and go straight to the browser window.

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Simple Example

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
}
```

This section will:

- Stretch **vertically to fill the entire screen**
    
- Stretch **horizontally to fill the screen width**
    

No need to define height on `html`, `body`, or `main`.

---

### 📉 Step 4: Downsides and Browser Quirks

The transcript hints at this:  
Modern units are powerful, **but they don’t have perfect browser support**, especially on older mobile browsers.

Issues include:

- `100vh` sometimes includes the mobile browser UI (like the address bar), which makes things taller than expected.
    
- On some devices, viewport height shifts dynamically as the user scrolls.

### ✅ When to Use What

|Use Case|Recommended Unit|
|---|---|
|Want full screen section|`height: 100vh`|
|Want to cover width of screen|`width: 100vw`|
|Need height relative to parent|`height: 100%` with height chain|
|Want responsive typography|`font-size: 2vw` (relative to screen size)|

---

### 🧠 Bonus: Combine Units with `calc()`

You can mix units together:

```css
height: calc(100vh - 80px); /* subtract navbar height */
```

This gives you a **hybrid layout**: part fixed, part flexible.

---

### ✅ Recap for Part 4

- `vh` and `vw` are units based on the **screen size**, not the parent element.
    
- They let you create full-page sections **without chaining heights**.
    
- `100vh` is easier and cleaner than using `height: 100%` + setting height on all parents.
    
- You still need to watch for **mobile quirks** in rare cases.
    
- You can combine units with `calc()` for more advanced layouts.
