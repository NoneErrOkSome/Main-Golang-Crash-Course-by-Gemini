## 🎬 **Lesson 2: How to Make `height: 100%` Work in CSS**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Unlike `width: 100%`, which works easily, `height: 100%` **often doesn’t do what you expect** — especially when you're trying to stretch an element to fill the entire page.

Let’s break down **why** this happens and how to **fix it properly**.

---

### 📌 **Step 1: The Mistake Everyone Makes**

```css
.section {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: tomato;
}
```

> ❗ You expect it to fill the full page...  
> But it only grows as tall as its **parent element**, which may not have any height defined at all.

---

### 🧠 **Step 2: Understanding What 100% Means**

> `height: 100%` means:
> 
> > "Take up 100% of **my parent’s height**."

But if the parent has **no height set**, there's nothing to refer to —  
and the browser defaults to "auto," which means:

> “Just grow as tall as your content.”

---

### 🧱 **Step 3: Fixing the Problem – Set Height on All Parents**

To make `height: 100%` work, you need to set height **all the way up the chain**:

```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

main {
  height: 100%;
}

.section {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: tomato;
}
```

✅ This works because:

- `html` gets 100% of the browser window height
    
- `body` inherits from `html`
    
- `main` inherits from `body`
    
- `.section` inherits from `main`
    

Now `.section` knows what 100% means — the full height of the page.

---

### 🧪 Try It:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <section class="full">I'm full height now!</section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
html, body, main {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}

.full {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: tomato;
}
```

---

### 📌 **Bonus Tip: Use Viewport Units (Modern Alternative)**

You can also skip the whole chain and use **viewport units**:

```css
.section {
  height: 100vh; /* 100% of the viewport height */
}
```

- `1vh` = 1% of the **viewport height**
    
- Works even if parents don’t have height set
    

✅ Modern browsers support this well, but keep in mind:

- On mobile, `100vh` may include the URL bar, so it **might jump around**

### 🧠 Final Summary

|Approach|Works With?|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|`height: 100%`|Only if parent has height|Requires all ancestors to define height|
|`height: 100vh`|Always (viewport height)|Easier, more modern|
