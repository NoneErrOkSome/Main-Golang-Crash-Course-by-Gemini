Great! Here's **Lesson 3: Visualizing the Parent–Child Height Chain** — focused, visual, and crystal clear.

## 🎬 **Lesson 3: Visualizing the Parent–Child Height Chain**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Let’s now _visualize_ how `height: 100%` flows down from the top of the page to your target element.  
> This is the **height inheritance chain** — and you need to **complete the chain** for it to work.

---

### 🧱 **Step 1: Imagine the DOM Tree as a Stack**

```
<html>
  ↓
<body>
  ↓
<main>
  ↓
<section class="box">
```

> If any element in this chain doesn’t have an explicit height,  
> the chain **breaks**, and `height: 100%` on `.box` will **not work**.

---

### 🧪 **Step 2: Broken Chain Example**

```css
.box {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: salmon;
}
```

> ❗ But if `main`, `body`, or `html` don’t have height set —  
> `.box` has **nothing to refer to** for its 100%.

✅ In DevTools, you'll see the `.box` only grows as tall as its content.

---

### 🧰 **Step 3: Fixing the Chain — Step by Step**

```css
html {
  height: 100%;  /* 100% of the browser window */
}

body {
  height: 100%;  /* 100% of html */
  margin: 0;
}

main {
  height: 100%;  /* 100% of body */
}

.box {
  height: 100%;  /* 100% of main */
  background-color: salmon;
}
```

✅ Now, `.box` = 100% of `main` = 100% of `body` = 100% of `html` = full page height.

### 🧠 Summary Diagram (Visual Mental Model)

```
[html]    → height: 100% of viewport ✅
   ↓
[body]    → height: 100% of html ✅
   ↓
[main]    → height: 100% of body ✅
   ↓
[section] → height: 100% of main ✅
```

> Every level **must define a height** to make the next one’s `height: 100%` work.

---

### 📝 Best Practice Checklist

✅ Add this once at the top of your CSS file if you’ll use full-height layouts:

```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}
```

> This alone sets up a reliable base for flexible height layouts later on.
