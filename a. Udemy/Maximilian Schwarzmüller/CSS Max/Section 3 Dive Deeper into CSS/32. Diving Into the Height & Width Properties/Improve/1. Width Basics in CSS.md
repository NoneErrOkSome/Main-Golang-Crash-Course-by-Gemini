Got it! Let's start with a cleaned-up, focused segment:

## 🎬 **Lesson 1: Width Basics in CSS**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Before we talk about height, let’s understand how **width** works for HTML elements — and how it behaves by default.

---

### 📦 **Step 1: Block vs Inline Elements**

- Block-level elements (like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<main>`)  
    ➜ **automatically take up the full width** of their parent container.
    
- Inline elements (like `<span>`, `<a>`)  
    ➜ Only take up **as much width as their content needs**.
    

🧪 **Try This:**

```html
<section class="box">Block Element</section>
<span class="inline-box">Inline Element</span>
```

```css
.box {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.inline-box {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

> You’ll see the section fills the row — but the span only surrounds the text.

---

### 📏 **Step 2: Setting Width Explicitly**

#### ✔️ 100% Width (Default for Block Elements)

```css
.box {
  width: 100%;
}
```

> This will **not visibly change anything**, because block elements already behave this way by default.

#### ✔️ Custom Percent Width

```css
.box {
  width: 50%;
}
```

> This will shrink the box to **half the width of its parent container**.

🧠 This is **relative width** — perfect for responsive layouts.

---

### 🔒 **Step 3: Using Fixed Widths (Pixels)**

```css
.box {
  width: 400px;
}
```

> This makes the element exactly 400 pixels wide — no matter how big the screen or parent is.

---

### 🧠 **Quick Summary**

|Width Value|Meaning|Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|`100%`|Full width of parent|Default for block elements|
|`50%`|Half the width of parent|Responsive / flexible|
|`300px`|Exactly 300 pixels wide|Fixed / not responsive|
