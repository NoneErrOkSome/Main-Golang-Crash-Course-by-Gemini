## 🎬 **Lesson 4: Understanding `height: auto`, `min-height`, and `vh`**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Now that you know how `height: 100%` works and how to make it work…  
> It’s time to understand **when not to use it** — and when other values like  
> `auto`, `min-height`, or `vh` are a better fit.

Let’s break them down.

---

### 📏 1. **`height: auto`** (Default Behavior)

```css
.section {
  height: auto;
}
```

✅ This is the default.

> It means:  
> ➤ “Let the content decide how tall this box should be.”

🧠 Use `auto` when:

- You want the section to grow naturally with content
    
- You **don’t need to fill** the full height
    

> **Do not combine `auto` with `height: 100%`** — they serve opposite purposes.

---

### 📐 2. **`min-height` — Minimum Height You Can Rely On**

```css
.hero {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

✅ This is very useful for layouts like splash screens or hero sections.

> It means:  
> ➤ “Always be at least this tall, but grow if needed.”

🧠 Use `min-height` when:

- You want something to **fill at least the screen** but grow if content pushes further
    
- You want to avoid scroll clipping
    

🧪 Example:

```css
.hero {
  min-height: 100vh;
  background: darkslateblue;
  color: white;
}
```

---

### 🪟 3. **`vh` — Viewport Height Units**

```css
.section {
  height: 100vh;
}
```

> `1vh = 1% of the viewport height`  
> So `100vh = full visible browser window`

🧠 Use `vh` when:

- You want an element to **perfectly fill the screen height**
    
- You don’t want to rely on parent containers
    

✅ Unlike `height: 100%`, this **does not need a parent chain**.

---

### 🚨 Mobile Tip: Beware `100vh` on Mobile

Some mobile browsers include the address bar in their height calculation — so `100vh` can appear **too tall** or **cause layout jumping**.

💡 Fix (coming in CSS later):

```css
height: 100svh;  /* "small viewport height" — safer on mobile */
```

> `svh`, `lvh`, and `dvh` are new viewport-relative units with better control.  
> Support is growing — use with fallbacks for now.

### 🧠 Final Summary Table

|Property|Behavior|Best Used For|
|---|---|---|
|`height: auto`|Grows with content|Default behavior — flexible layouts|
|`height: 100%`|Matches parent height (if defined)|Requires height on all parent elements|
|`min-height`|Sets a minimum, grows if needed|Hero sections, flexible full-page blocks|
|`height: 100vh`|100% of viewport height (fixed)|Full-screen layouts, no parent required|
|`height: 100svh`|Safer 100vh for mobile|Viewport-aware layouts|
