## 🧱 Part 1: Understanding Width — The Straightforward One

### 🎯 Objective:

Understand how width behaves in CSS, especially in block-level elements like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and how setting width using different units (percentages vs pixels) affects the layout.

---

### 🟩 Step 1: What Happens By Default?

By default, many HTML elements are **block-level elements** — meaning they naturally take up the **entire width of their parent container**.

#### Example elements:

- `<div>`
    
- `<section>`
    
- `<main>`
    
- `<h1>`, `<p>`, etc.
    

So, if a `<section>` is inside `<main>`, and you don’t set any width, it automatically fills the entire width of `<main>`, even though you never told it to.

💡 **So `width: 100%` is already happening — you just don’t see it written.**

---

### 🟨 Step 2: What Happens if You Explicitly Set `width: 100%`?

If you add:

```css
section {
  width: 100%;
}
```

You won’t visually see any difference. That’s because the section **already** behaves this way. You’re just being explicit.

However, setting it like this **can be helpful for clarity**, especially when you're working in teams or overriding styles.

---

### 🟧 Step 3: Let’s Try `width: 50%`

This is where things get interesting.

If you set:

```css
section {
  width: 50%;
}
```

Now the section visibly **shrinks to half the width** of its container.

If the container is `<main>` and `<main>` takes up the full page width, then `50%` of `<main>` = **50% of the screen width**.

🧠 Percentages in width always refer to the **width of the parent** — never the screen, unless the parent is the screen.

---

### 🟥 Step 4: What If the Parent Has Its Own Width?

Let’s say you do this:

```css
main {
  width: 800px;
}

section {
  width: 50%;
}
```

Now the section will be **400px wide**, because 50% of 800px is 400px.

💡 **Always remember:**  
**% width is relative to the direct parent.**  
So changing the parent affects the child automatically.

---

### ⚫ Step 5: Using Absolute Values Like `px`

You can also use **pixel values** for width instead of percentages:

```css
section {
  width: 300px;
}
```

This makes the section exactly **300 pixels wide**, no matter how wide the screen or the parent is.

If you change it to `700px`, it’ll grow larger. These are **fixed sizes**, not relative.

---

### 🔁 When to Use What?

|Use This|When|
|---|---|
|`width: 100%`|You want the element to stretch full width of parent|
|`width: 50%`|You want a proportionate width that adapts to screen/container|
|`width: 300px`|You want a consistent, fixed-width box no matter the screen size|

---

### ✅ Recap for Part 1

- Most block-level elements already take 100% width by default.
    
- `width: 100%` makes it explicit but may not visually change anything.
    
- `width: 50%` shrinks the element relative to its parent’s width.
    
- `width: 300px` gives you a fixed size, independent of screen or parent width.
    
- Percentage-based widths are **dynamic** and flexible, while pixel-based widths are **fixed**.
