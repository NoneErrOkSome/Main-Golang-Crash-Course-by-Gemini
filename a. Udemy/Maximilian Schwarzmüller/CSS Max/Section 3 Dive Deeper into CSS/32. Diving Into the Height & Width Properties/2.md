Perfect — here’s **Part 2: Understanding Height**, fully expanded and clarified in my own words, while staying completely within the original transcript's scope.

## 🧱 Part 2: Understanding Height — The Tricky One

### 🎯 Objective:

Learn how `height` behaves in CSS, why `height: 100%` doesn’t work like `width: 100%`, and what it takes to make it work properly.

---

### 🟩 Step 1: What Happens by Default?

Just like with width, block-level elements will stretch across the **entire width** of their container. But when it comes to **height**, it's **not the same**.

Most containers (like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<div>`) **don’t have a fixed height**. Instead, they **automatically grow in height** depending on the content inside them.

So if your `<section>` contains just one `<h1>`, it will only be tall enough to fit that `<h1>`.

---

### 🟨 Step 2: What Happens if You Set `height: 100%`?

Let’s say you try:

```css
section {
  height: 100%;
}
```

You might **expect** this section to take up the full height of the screen.  
But... nothing really happens. It just grows a bit — maybe adds a few pixels in height.

**Why?**  
Because `100%` is **relative to the height of the parent**, and the parent (`<main>`) **doesn’t have a defined height either**.

So if the parent has no height, then `100%` of "nothing" is... nothing. 💡

---

### 🟧 Step 3: The Parent-Child Relationship for Height

Let’s imagine this chain:

```
html → body → main → section
```

Each of these is a parent of the next.

If you want the `section` to fill the screen vertically using `height: 100%`, each parent **must have a height set too**. Otherwise, each one defaults to “as tall as its content,” and the 100% has nothing to work with.

---

### 🟥 Step 4: Fixing It with an Explicit Height

Try setting a **fixed height** on the parent:

```css
main {
  height: 500px;
}
section {
  height: 100%;
}
```

Now, the section grows to **match the 500px height of `<main>`** — it finally works as expected!

This proves the point:  
`height: 100%` only works **if the parent has a height you can reference.**

---

### 🔗 Step 5: Creating a “Height Chain” All the Way Up

To make `section { height: 100% }` fill the **entire screen**, you need to “pass down” height values from top to bottom:

```css
html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  height: 100%;
}

main {
  height: 100%;
}

section {
  height: 100%;
}
```

Each level passes the height reference to the next. Now the section **truly fills the screen**.

---

### ⚠️ Step 6: Why It Doesn’t Work Without the Chain

If any one of these elements (`html`, `body`, `main`) is missing `height: 100%`, the chain **breaks**.

That’s why people often get confused when `height: 100%` just... does nothing. The height can’t be calculated because there’s no reference.

---

### ⚙️ Pro Tip: The Modern Way (Preview)

The lecturer hints that there's a **newer unit** that makes this easier — like `100vh` (100% of the viewport height) — but it’s covered in a later section.

This unit doesn’t depend on the parent’s height, so it can be used independently.

---

### ✅ Recap for Part 2

- Height doesn’t behave like width — it doesn’t stretch by default.
    
- `height: 100%` only works if the parent has a defined height.
    
- You need to pass height down the chain: `html → body → main → section`.
    
- Fixed height values (like `500px`) can be used to test and understand this behavior.
    
- Without this chain, `100%` is meaningless — there's no reference height to use.
