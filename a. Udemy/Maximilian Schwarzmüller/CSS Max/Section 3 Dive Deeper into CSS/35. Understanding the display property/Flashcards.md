Here are **flashcards** based on the lecture transcript:

---

### **Flashcard 1**

**Q: What does the `display` property control?**  
**A: It controls how an element is rendered, such as `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, or `none`.**

---

### **Flashcard 2**

**Q: What is the default display behavior of block-level elements?**  
**A: Block-level elements take up the full width of their parent container and start on a new line.**

---

### **Flashcard 3**

**Q: What is the default display behavior of inline elements?**  
**A: Inline elements only take as much width as needed and stay in the same line as other elements.**

---

### **Flashcard 4**

**Q: What happens when an inline element is set to `display: block`?**  
**A: It behaves like a block-level element, taking the full width and starting on a new line.**

---

### **Flashcard 5**

**Q: What does `display: none` do?**  
**A: It removes the element from the visible layout and document flow, but it remains in the DOM.**

---

### **Flashcard 6**

**Q: How does `display: inline-block` behave?**  
**A: It combines inline layout (sits next to other elements) with block-level properties like padding and margins.**

---

### **Flashcard 7**

**Q: Why is `display: none` useful in conjunction with JavaScript?**  
**A: It allows elements like modals to be toggled visible or hidden dynamically.**

---

### **Flashcard 8**

**Q: What is BEM (Block Element Modifier)?**  
**A: A naming convention for CSS classes to ensure clarity and avoid accidental reuse. Example: `main-nav__item`.**

---

### **Flashcard 9**

**Q: How does padding behave differently for inline and block elements?**  
**A: For inline elements, padding only affects left and right. For block or inline-block, padding applies to all sides.**

---

### **Flashcard 10**

**Q: What is the purpose of `inline-block` in navigation design?**  
**A: It allows navigation items to align horizontally while still enabling block-level styling for spacing and padding.**

---

### **Flashcard 11**

**Q: What happens when you apply `padding` to an inline-block element?**  
**A: Padding affects all sides of the element, allowing for consistent spacing inside the box.**

---

### **Flashcard 12**

**Q: What is the difference between `display: none` and visibility hidden?**  
**A: `display: none` removes the element from the document flow, while `visibility: hidden` makes it invisible but keeps its space.**

---

### **Flashcard 13**

**Q: How does the box model apply to inline elements?**  
**A: Inline elements use the box model, but top and bottom margins or padding have little to no effect.**

---

### **Flashcard 14**

**Q: What is the purpose of the `list-style` property when working with `<ul>` or `<ol>`?**  
**A: It customizes or removes bullet points and numbering. Example: `list-style: none;`.**

---

### **Flashcard 15**

**Q: What is the advantage of using `display: inline-block` for navigation items?**  
**A: It allows items to appear in a single line while still supporting top/bottom margins and paddings.**

---

### **Flashcard 16**

**Q: How does `margin` behave for inline elements?**  
**A: Margins on the left and right work, but top and bottom margins are ignored or minimally effective.**

---

### **Flashcard 17**

**Q: What CSS class naming pattern was introduced in the lecture?**  
**A: The BEM pattern, where class names are structured as `block__element--modifier` for clarity.**

---

### **Flashcard 18**

**Q: What does `display: block` enforce on an element?**  
**A: The element takes the full width available and starts on a new line.**

---

### **Flashcard 19**

**Q: What property can you use to dynamically show or hide elements in JavaScript?**  
**A: Use `display: none` to hide elements and toggle them as needed.**

---

### **Flashcard 20**

**Q: Why is `inline-block` useful for navigation menus compared to `block`?**  
**A: It aligns items horizontally like `inline`, but still allows block-level features for spacing and padding.**
