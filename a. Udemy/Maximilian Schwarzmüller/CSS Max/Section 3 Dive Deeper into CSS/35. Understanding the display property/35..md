### **CSS Properties Used in the Lecture**

1. **`display`**: Controls how an element is rendered in the document. Values include:
    
    - `block`: Makes the element behave like a block, taking full width.
    - `inline`: Makes the element behave inline, taking only as much space as needed.
    - `inline-block`: Combines block styling (supports padding/margin) with inline layout.
    - `none`: Hides the element from the layout and document flow.
2. **`padding`**: Adds space inside an element's border. Affects both inline and block elements differently. For block and inline-block, padding applies to all sides; for inline, it only affects left and right.
    
3. **`margin`**: Adds space outside an element's border. Margins on top and bottom are ignored for inline elements but apply fully to block and inline-block elements.
    

These properties demonstrate how layout behavior can be manipulated for navigation design and flexible alignment.
