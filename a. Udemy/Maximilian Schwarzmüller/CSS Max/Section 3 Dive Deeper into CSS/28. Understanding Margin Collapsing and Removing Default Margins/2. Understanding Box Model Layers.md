## 🎬 **Part 2: Understanding Box Model Layers**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Now that we’ve removed the unexpected spacing from the `<body>`,  
> let’s understand how **spacing really works** in CSS — using something called the **box model**.

---

### 📦 **Step 1: What Is the Box Model?**

> Every HTML element is treated as a **box** in CSS.  
> This box is made up of **four layers**:

```
| MARGIN |  ← outermost
| BORDER |
| PADDING |
| CONTENT |  ← innermost
```

> Let’s go through each layer step-by-step:

### 🧱 **Step 2: Layer Breakdown**

|Layer|Description|
|---|---|
|**Content**|The actual text or image inside the element|
|**Padding**|Space between the content and the border|
|**Border**|The visible edge around the padding|
|**Margin**|Space **outside** the element — separates it from other elements|

> Think of it like a shipping box:
> 
> - The **content** is the item inside
>     
> - The **padding** is the bubble wrap
>     
> - The **border** is the cardboard box
>     
> - The **margin** is the space between this box and other boxes in the truck
>

### 🧪 **Step 3: Try It Yourself**

> Let’s style a simple `<div>` to visualize the box model:

```html
<div class="box">Hello</div>
```

```css
.box {
  padding: 20px;
  border: 4px solid orange;
  margin: 30px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

> Open this in the browser and inspect it.  
> You’ll see each layer clearly color-coded in the DevTools **Box Model panel**.

---

### 🧠 **Key Takeaway**

> ✅ CSS spacing is made up of **4 layers** in this order:  
> **Content → Padding → Border → Margin**

> 🎯 Understanding these layers helps you control spacing and layout precisely.
