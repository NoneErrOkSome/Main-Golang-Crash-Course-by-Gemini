## 🎬 **Part 1: Unexpected Spacing – What’s Going On?**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Let's start with something you may have noticed when building your first webpage:  
> even though you didn’t add any spacing, there’s **some white space** around your content.  
> Why is that?

---

### 🧪 **Step 1: Inspect the Layout**

> Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (usually right-click ➜ "Inspect").  
> Hover over the `<body>` element.  
> You’ll likely see **orange spacing** around it. That’s **margin**.  
> And if you look closely, you’ll see it’s exactly **8px** by default.

---

### 📦 **Step 2: Understand the Cause**

> This 8px is not something _you_ added — it's coming from the **browser’s default stylesheet**.  
> Browsers apply default styling to certain elements like `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`, etc.

---

### 🧹 **Step 3: Fix the Body Margin**

> To remove this default margin and make your content stretch **edge to edge**,  
> simply reset the body’s margin like this:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

> Reload the page — now your content touches the edges of the screen.  
> No more hidden space.

---

### 🧠 **Key Takeaway**

> ✅ Most browsers add **default margin** to the `<body>` and other elements.  
> 🧼 Always begin your CSS by **resetting the margin** to avoid layout surprises.
