## 🎬 **Part 3: Intro to Margin Collapsing**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor Script**

> Now that you understand the **box model**, let's talk about something that often surprises beginners:  
> **margin collapsing** — a special rule in CSS that affects how **vertical margins** behave.

---

### ⚠️ **Step 1: The Common Scenario**

> Imagine you have two stacked block elements like this:

```html
<div class="section-a">A</div>
<div class="section-b">B</div>
```

```css
.section-a {
  margin-bottom: 40px;
  background: lightcoral;
}

.section-b {
  margin-top: 30px;
  background: lightgreen;
}
```

> You might expect the space between them to be **40px + 30px = 70px**...  
> But if you open this in the browser, you’ll notice:  
> ❗ The actual gap is **only 40px**, not 70px.

---

### 🔍 **Step 2: Why? → Margin Collapsing**

> This behavior is called **margin collapsing**.  
> When two vertical margins **meet**, they **collapse into one**.  
> ✅ And the browser keeps **only the larger one**.

> In our example:

- `.section-a` has `margin-bottom: 40px`
    
- `.section-b` has `margin-top: 30px`
    
- Final spacing between them = **40px** (the larger of the two)
    

---

### 🎯 **Step 3: Why CSS Works This Way**

> Margin collapsing is not a bug — it’s intentional.  
> It's designed to **prevent double spacing** between stacked elements.

> 🧠 Think of it as CSS saying:
> 
> > "Since these two margins touch, I’ll only keep the bigger one."

---

### 🖼️ **Step 4: Visual Explanation (Optional)**

You can imagine this:

```
[Box A]
   ↓  margin-bottom: 40px
---------------
   ↑  margin-top: 30px
[Box B]
```

👉 Only the **larger of the two** (40px) is applied between them.

---

### 🧠 **Key Takeaway**

> ✅ When **two vertical margins** touch, **only the larger one stays** —  
> this is **margin collapsing**.

> 🧩 It mostly happens:
> 
> - Between **stacked siblings**
>     
> - Between **parent and first/last child**
>     
> - Inside **empty elements**
>
