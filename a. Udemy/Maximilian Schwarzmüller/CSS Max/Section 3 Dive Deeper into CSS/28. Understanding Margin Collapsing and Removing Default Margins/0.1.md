**🧱 Margin Collapsing in CSS: Explained Simply**

---

### ✅ What Is Margin Collapsing?

**Margin collapsing** happens when **two vertical margins meet**, and **they merge (collapse) into one margin** — not added together.

---

### 🧩 When Does It Happen?

There are **3 main situations** where margin collapsing occurs:

#### 1. **Adjacent Siblings**

If two block elements are next to each other and both have top/bottom margins:

```html
<div class="box1"></div>
<div class="box2"></div>
```

```css
.box1 {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}
.box2 {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```

👉 The vertical space between them will be **30px** (the larger one), not 50px.

---

#### 2. **Parent and First/Last Child**

If a parent has no padding or borders, its vertical margin may collapse with its child.

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.parent {
  margin-top: 40px;
}
.child {
  margin-top: 30px;
}
```

👉 The **larger margin wins** (40px), not 70px.

---

#### 3. **Empty Blocks**

If a block has no content, padding, or borders, its top and bottom margins **collapse together**.

```css
.empty {
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}
```

👉 Resulting vertical margin is **30px**, not 50px.

### 🛠️ How to Prevent Margin Collapsing

You can **stop** collapsing by doing any of these:

- Add `padding` or `border` between parent and child
    
- Add `overflow: hidden;` or `overflow: auto;` to the parent
    
- Add `display: flow-root;` to the parent (modern fix)
