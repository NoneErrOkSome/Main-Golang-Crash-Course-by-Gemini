The lecturer is teaching key CSS styling techniques, focusing on **text-decoration**, **font styles**, and **vertical alignment** to refine the appearance and positioning of navigation elements in a webpage. Here's a breakdown of the lessons:

1. **Text Decoration**:
    
    - Explains how to remove the default underlining on anchor (`<a>`) tags using `text-decoration: none;`.
    - Highlights the browser's default styling for links and demonstrates how to override it.
2. **Font Styling**:
    
    - Shows how to change the font color using a specific hex code (e.g., `#0e4f1f`).
    - Adjusts the font weight to `bold` using `font-weight: bold;`, emphasizing the importance of importing the correct font weight from external font libraries.
    - Increases the font size (e.g., to `22px`) for better emphasis on the brand.
3. **Position Adjustments**:
    
    - Addresses how increasing font size may impact layout, causing elements to shift into new lines.
    - Demonstrates calculating widths using percentages and adjusting CSS rules dynamically (e.g., `width: calc(100% - 74px);`) to accommodate changes in size.
4. **Vertical Alignment**:
    
    - Introduces the `vertical-align` property to align elements in the middle of their container.
    - Explains the need to apply `vertical-align: middle;` to both adjacent elements to achieve proper alignment.
5. **CSS Organization**:
    
    - Encourages assigning specific class names to elements (e.g., `main-header__brand`) for targeted styling.
    - Reinforces the importance of organizing CSS rules logically, aligning with the structure of the HTML.
6. **Browser Debugging**:
    
    - Encourages inspecting elements in the browser to understand and address styling issues (e.g., measuring new element widths after font size changes).

The overarching goal is to teach effective CSS techniques for styling navigation and branding elements, focusing on improving aesthetics, maintaining alignment, and achieving a polished, professional look.
