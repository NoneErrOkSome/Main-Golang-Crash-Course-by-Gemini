## 🟩 Part 6: Style Header — Width, Background Color

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Now that we’ve attached the `.main-header` class, let’s focus on:

- Making the header span **full width**
    
- Giving it a strong **green background**
    

This step prepares the visual structure of your nav bar area.

---

### 🧠 What the Instructor Says

> “To set the width to 100%, we simply add `width: 100%`...”

> “Now besides that, we want to set a background color. I mentioned I want to use green… I prepared a special hex code…”

> “It’s the same green we used for the section title…”

---

### ✅ CSS To Add (or verify)

In your `styles.css`:

```css
.main-header {
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #2ddf5c;
}
```

---

### 🔍 Why This Matters

|Property|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`width: 100%`|Ensures the header spans the whole page width|
|`background-color`|Makes the header stand out visually|

> Even though `<header>` is a block-level element and already fills width by default, setting `width: 100%` is good **explicit practice** — especially useful later for layout overrides.

### 🎨 Optional Visual Reference

This green: `#2ddf5c`  
🟩 A fresh, vibrant green used consistently in the theme

---

### 💬 Instructor's Intent

> “This is kind of the main theme color our application will use.”

> “Of course you are free to choose any green you want…”

So while this color is suggested, you’re allowed to tweak it — but stick with this for consistency during the course.

### 🧠 Summary

Your `.main-header` is now:

- Visually distinct
    
- Full-width
    
- Themed
