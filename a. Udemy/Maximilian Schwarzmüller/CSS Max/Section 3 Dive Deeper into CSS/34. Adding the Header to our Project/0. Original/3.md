## 🟩 Part 3: First Render — The Ugly Header

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Preview how the new header _looks before any styling_ — and notice:  
✅ the links work structurally  
❌ but look ugly and stacked

---

### 🧠 What Happens Here (from the transcript)

> “...if we save that and also save the updated main.css file of course and reload it, we got this ugly part at the top.”

> “Our goal for the next lectures will be to turn this into a non-ugly part.”

This part is just about observing what the browser renders when you’ve only added HTML.

### 🖼️ What You See in Browser

- The header now appears **above the content**
    
- The nav links:
    
    - Stack **vertically**
        
    - Have default **blue + underlined** style
        
    - Show default list **bullets**
        
- Looks unstyled and not aligned at all — but that’s expected!

### 📄 Your HTML so far:

```html
<header>
  <div>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Products</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
</header>
```

> No classes or styles yet. The goal is to **confirm the markup works**.

---

### ✅ What You Should Do

- Save your HTML file
    
- Refresh the browser
    
- Confirm the structure appears visually (even if ugly)
    

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaway

This is an **intentional stop** before styling — to:

- Prove that semantic structure is added
    
- Get a “before” state to compare styling changes later
