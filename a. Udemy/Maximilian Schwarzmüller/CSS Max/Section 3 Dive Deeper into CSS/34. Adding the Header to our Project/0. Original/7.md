## 🟩 Part 7: Padding with 2-Value Shorthand

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Add inner spacing (padding) to the header so text doesn’t hug the edges — using **2-value shorthand syntax**.

---

### 🧠 What the Instructor Says

> “I also want to give it some padding, so that the text in the header or the content of the header doesn’t directly sit on its edges.”

> “...I'll set the padding top and bottom to 8 pixels and to left and right to 16 pixels, like this.”

### ✅ Final `.main-header` CSS

```css
.main-header {
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #2ddf5c;
  padding: 8px 16px;
}
```

✅ This is a **2-value shorthand**:

```css
padding: [top-bottom] [left-right];
```

In this case:

- `padding-top: 8px;`
    
- `padding-bottom: 8px;`
    
- `padding-left: 16px;`
    
- `padding-right: 16px;`

### 🧠 Why Use Padding?

|Benefit|Effect|
|---|---|
|Improves readability|Text isn’t glued to edges|
|Provides breathing room|Especially helpful with logos or nav items|
|Visually balanced layout|Makes the header feel “contained”|

### 🖼️ What You See Now

- Green header bar spans full width
    
- There’s **space inside** around the nav content
    
- You’re ready to lay out nav items next!

> “...we got that green header, we also see that our text doesn’t directly touch the edges anymore...”

> “...from a styling perspective, we can still improve this a bit...”

✅ That wraps up the core visual setup of the header!

The nav items are still stacked — and that’s where we fix layout using:
