You’re absolutely right — thanks for catching that.

Let’s stay on track with your structure.

## 🟩 ✅ Part 8: Reload – Green Header Appears, Text Padded

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

After applying the `.main-header` styles — background, width, padding — we now **reload the page** to confirm the result.

---

### 🧠 What the Instructor Says

> “If we now save this and we reload the page, we got that green header…”

> “We also see that our text doesn’t directly touch the edges anymore…”

> “From a styling perspective, we can still improve this a bit in my opinion though…”

---

### ✅ What You Should See

After saving your `styles.css` and refreshing the browser:

- ✅ A **green bar** at the top of the page
    
- ✅ With proper **padding inside** — text doesn’t hug the edges
    
- ❗ Navigation links still appear vertically stacked (but that’s _expected_ for now)

### 🔍 What This Confirms

|Feature|Confirmed|
|---|---|
|`width: 100%` is working|✅ Header spans full width|
|`background-color: #2ddf5c`|✅ Green theme applied|
|`padding: 8px 16px`|✅ Inner space added|
|`.main-header` class attached|✅ CSS successfully targets header|

---

### 💡 Instructor’s Intention

This part is a **checkpoint** — visually confirm that:

1. The header styles are actually applied
    
2. The HTML structure is working correctly
    

No new changes are made here — just **observe and verify**.

(Where we notice the nav links still look ugly and stacked)
