Based strictly on the **original transcript** you provided — without improving or restructuring the teaching style — and **matching each natural “action step” or HTML/CSS update** mentioned in the flow, you would need exactly:

### ✅ **9 parts** to cover all the lecture steps with matching HTML and CSS:

| Part | Title                                          | Focus                                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | Initial Cleanup                                | Remove ugly border and margin from `#product-overview`, keep padding |
| 2️⃣  | Add Navigation Markup (Header + Nav + UL + LI) | Paste given navigation structure into HTML                           |
| 3️⃣  | First Render — The Ugly Header                 | Save and observe unstyled header content                             |
| 4️⃣  | Element Selector vs. Class Selector            | Why we avoid `header {}` and create `.main-header` instead           |
| 5️⃣  | Add Class to Header Element                    | Add `class="main-header"` to `<header>`                              |
| 6️⃣  | Style Header: Width, Background Color          | Add `width: 100%` and `background-color: #2ddf5c`                    |
| 7️⃣  | Padding with 2-Value Shorthand                 | Add `padding: 8px 16px`                                              |
| 8️⃣  | Reload: Green Header Appears, Text Padded      | Save & preview the styled header                                     |
| 9️⃣  | The Problem with List Layout                   | `<li>` elements stack — preview problem before introducing `flex`    |

### ✅ Summary

- These 9 parts follow the **natural progression of the lecture exactly as spoken**
    
- No added improvements or optimization — just reflect how the instructor walks through it
    
- The **next lecture** would begin with `display: flex` to fix the nav list layout (not included in this part)
