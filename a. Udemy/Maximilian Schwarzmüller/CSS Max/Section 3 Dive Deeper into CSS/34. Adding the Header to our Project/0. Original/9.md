## 🟩 Part 9: The Problem with List Layout

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Observe the **unstyled navigation list** — and realize we need to fix how it appears on screen.

---

### 🧠 What the Instructor Says

> “This unordered list doesn’t look that great…”

> “We don’t want to have a list rendered like that...”

> “...from a styling perspective, all these list items should sit next to each other — not on top of each other.”

---

### ❌ What You See Now

Your browser shows:

- The green header ✅
    
- But inside:
    
    ```
    • Home  
    • Products  
    • About  
    • Contact
    ```
    
- ❗ Links are stacked vertically
    
- ❗ There are default bullets
    
- ❗ Font size and spacing look messy

### 🔍 Why It Looks Like This (Browser Defaults)

|Element|Browser Default Behavior|
|---|---|
|`<ul>`|Adds margin/padding, displays items stacked|
|`<li>`|Adds bullets and vertical layout|
|`<a>`|Blue, underlined, block or inline|

> All of this is **unstyled**, and it’s normal for now. We haven’t touched the list or the links yet.

### 💡 What This Sets Up

This part **introduces the problem** we’re about to solve:

- Use **`display`** to lay out items horizontally
    
- Remove bullets
    
- Reset spacing
    
- Improve visual flow
    

> Instructor's hint:  
> “Now to achieve this, we’ll actually need to dive into a new property — the `display` property…”

---

✅ You’ve completed all setup steps. Your header and nav are in place, styled, and semantically correct.
