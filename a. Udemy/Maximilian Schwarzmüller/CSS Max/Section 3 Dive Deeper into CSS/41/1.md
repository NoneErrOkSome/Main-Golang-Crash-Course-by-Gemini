### Part 1: Adding Margins for Spacing Between Navigation Links

**Concept:**  
Inline-block elements have restrictions regarding vertical spacing (top and bottom margins), but horizontal spacing (left and right margins) works as expected. By using a margin shorthand, you can control spacing without affecting layout integrity.

**Implementation:**

1. Target the `.main-nav__item` class in your CSS.
2. Use the shorthand property for margin:
    
    - First value (`0`) refers to the top and bottom margins.
    - Second value (`16px`) refers to the left and right margins.
    
    ```css
    .main-nav__item {
        margin: 0 16px;
    }
    ```
    

**Effect:**  
The links within the navigation now have more space between them horizontally. This approach keeps the layout intact and prevents elements from jumping to a new line.
