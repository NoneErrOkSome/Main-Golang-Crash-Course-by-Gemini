### Part 2: Styling Anchor Tags (Text Decoration and Color)

**Concept:**  
Anchor tags (`<a>`) are styled by browsers with default properties like underlines (`text-decoration: underline`) and a default text color. To override these, you must directly target the anchor tags since changing the parent elements (like `<li>`) won't affect the anchor tags due to CSS specificity and inheritance limitations.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Target the Anchor Tags:**  
    Use a combinator to select anchor tags nested within `.main-nav__item`.
    
    ```css
    .main-nav__item a {
        text-decoration: none; /* Removes underline */
        color: #0e4f1f; /* Matches the green color used for the brand */
    }
    ```
    
2. **Explanation of the Selector:**
    
    - `.main-nav__item a` targets `<a>` tags that are children of elements with the class `.main-nav__item`.
    - This is a high-performance selector since it directly selects specific nested elements, avoiding unnecessary global classes.

**Effect:**

- The underlines from the links are removed (`text-decoration: none`).
- The text color of the links changes to the same green color (`#0e4f1f`) as the `.main-header__brand`.
