### Part 4: Final Notes and Optimization

**Review of Changes:**

1. **Spacing:**
    
    - Added horizontal spacing between the navigation links using `margin: 0 16px;` in the `.main-nav__item` class.
    - This ensures a clean and consistent layout without affecting vertical alignment.
2. **Anchor Tag Styling:**
    
    - Removed the default underline (`text-decoration: none`) and applied the custom green color (`color: #0e4f1f`) to match the brand.
    - This provides a cohesive and polished appearance for the links.
3. **Hover Effects:**
    
    - Introduced dynamic hover styles using the `:hover` pseudo-class to improve user experience.
    - Hovering over a link now shows a lighter green color (`#2ddf5c`) with an underline for emphasis.

**Optimization Considerations:**

- **Performance of Selectors:**
    - Using `.main-nav__item a` is efficient as it directly targets anchor tags within the navigation without additional classes.
- **Readability and Maintainability:**
    - Group related styles together for better organization. For instance:
        
        ```css
        .main-nav__item a {
            text-decoration: none;
            color: #0e4f1f;
        }
        
        .main-nav__item a:hover {
            text-decoration: underline;
            color: #2ddf5c;
        }
        ```
        

**Outcome:**  
The navigation bar is now visually appealing, functionally interactive, and optimized for user experience. The links are cleanly spaced, styled to match the brand, and provide clear feedback on hover.
