### Part 3: Adding Hover Effects to Anchor Tags

**Concept:**  
Hover effects enhance user experience by providing visual feedback when the mouse pointer moves over a link. This is achieved using the `:hover` pseudo-class in CSS, which allows you to define styles specifically for the hovered state of an element.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Target Hover State:**  
    Use the combinator `.main-nav__item a:hover` to style the anchor tags when hovered.
    
    ```css
    .main-nav__item a:hover {
        text-decoration: underline; /* Adds an underline to emphasize hover */
        color: #2ddf5c; /* Changes text color to a lighter green for contrast */
    }
    ```
    
2. **Explanation of Hover Styles:**
    
    - `text-decoration: underline`: Restores the underline as a visual cue on hover, emphasizing the interactive nature of the links.
    - `color: #2ddf5c`: Applies a lighter green color to distinguish the hovered state from the default appearance.

**Effect:**

- When users hover over the links, the text color changes to a lighter green, and an underline appears.
- This dynamic styling makes the navigation links more interactive and visually engaging.
