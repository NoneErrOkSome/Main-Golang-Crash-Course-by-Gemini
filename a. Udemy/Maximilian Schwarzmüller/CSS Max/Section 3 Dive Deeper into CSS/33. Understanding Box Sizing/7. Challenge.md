Awesome! Here comes your **practice challenge**, designed to help you apply everything you've learned about:

- `box-sizing`
    
- the CSS box model (content, padding, border, margin)
    
- visual debugging in DevTools
    
- layout behavior with width, height, overflow

## 🧠 Challenge: The Mysterious Overflowing Box

You’ve been given the following CSS and HTML:

```html
<section class="hero">
  <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
</section>
```

```css
.hero {
  width: 100%;
  height: 528px;
  padding: 40px;
  border: 10px solid #333;
  background-color: crimson;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

When you open the browser, you see:

- The red hero section **spills past the right edge** of the screen
    
- A **horizontal scrollbar** appears 😵
    
- The page feels "broken" — but `width: 100%` looks fine
    
- Even removing margin from the `<h1>` **doesn’t help**

## 🔍 Task

1. **Inspect the element** in DevTools
    
2. **Analyze** the Box Model:
    
    - What’s the content width?
        
    - How much space is padding and border adding?
        
3. **Explain** why the layout is broken, in terms of how `box-sizing` behaves by default
    
4. **Fix the layout** using what you've learned
    
    - Don't change the width or padding — just apply the correct approach

## ✅ Bonus Question

Why _doesn’t_ the `h1` margin affect the overflow in this case?

When you're ready, reply with:

- Your **diagnosis** of the problem
    
- Your **fix** (ideally just one or two lines of CSS)
    
- Your **reasoning** behind that fix
    

Let’s see how well you can debug like a pro 🧰🔥
