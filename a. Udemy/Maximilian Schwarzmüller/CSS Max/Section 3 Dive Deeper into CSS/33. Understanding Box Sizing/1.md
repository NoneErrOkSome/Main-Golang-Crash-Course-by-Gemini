# 🧱 Part 1 Deep Dive: The Unexpected Problem

---

## 🧩 What Most People Think Happens

Let’s say you're building a layout. You add a nice red box using CSS like this:

```css
section {
  width: 100%;
  height: 528px;
}
```

You're expecting that:

- The box stretches across the screen.
    
- The height is locked at exactly 528 pixels.
    
- You're done, right?
    

✅ At this point, your assumption is _technically correct_ — the box fills the width and has the height you set.

---

## 🎯 Now You Add Some Realistic Styling

Later, you decide:

> "Hmm, this box looks a bit cramped. Let me add some padding and a border."

```css
section {
  width: 100%;
  height: 528px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

You save and refresh your browser and suddenly notice something strange:

- Your red box **is too wide**.
    
- It's **pushed off the right edge of the screen**.
    
- You even get a **horizontal scrollbar** (😫).
    

What just happened?

## 🧠 The Mistake: What You _Didn’t Know_ You Were Asking For

When you wrote `width: 100%`, you were asking:

> “Make the **content area** of this section exactly 100% as wide as the screen.”

But then you added padding and border.

So now, the browser thinks:

```
Final Width = 100% (content) + 10px left padding + 10px right padding + 5px left border + 5px right border
```

That’s **+30 extra pixels**.  
So your box becomes **wider than the screen**.

💥 _Overflow happens._  
And you're left wondering why your layout broke.

## 🔎 Why This Is Confusing

This catches **everyone** off guard the first time.

Why?

Because the browser default `box-sizing: content-box` is _counter-intuitive_ for layout design.  
Most developers think of the box as a whole — not just the content.

---

## 📐 Visual Example (Described)

Imagine drawing a rectangle that says “300px wide.”  
You expect everything — text, padding, borders — to fit _inside_ that 300px.

But with `content-box`, only the **text area** is 300px.  
Add 20px of padding and 10px of border?  
That box is now **360px wide** — and that’s not what you meant.

---

## 🛑 So What’s the Takeaway?

When you set `width: 100%`, it doesn’t mean:

> “Make the whole box — everything I see — 100% wide.”

It means:

> “Make just the **content box** 100% wide, and I’ll stack padding and border **on top**.”

That’s the root of the unexpected problem.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

- Layouts break and overflow even when you “did nothing wrong.”
    
- Your width and height declarations don’t do what you _think_ they do.
    
- You lose confidence and control over your design.
    

So before you even touch `box-sizing`, the key is to **see** the invisible assumption:

> “CSS width and height only apply to the content box by default.”
