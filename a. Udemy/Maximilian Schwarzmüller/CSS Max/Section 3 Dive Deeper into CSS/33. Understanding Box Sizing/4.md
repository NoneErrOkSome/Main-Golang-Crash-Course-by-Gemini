# 🧱 Part 4 Deep Dive: Applying `box-sizing: border-box` Globally

---

## 🎯 Objective

You’ve learned that `box-sizing: border-box` is more predictable and layout-friendly.  
Now the goal is to understand:

- ✅ Why you should apply it **to all elements**
    
- ✅ Why inheritance alone is **not enough**
    
- ✅ Why the **universal selector** is the best tool for this job
    

---

## 🔄 The Inheritance Trap

You might think:

```css
body {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Great, now everything should inherit it… right?

❌ Not quite.

- `box-sizing` **does not reliably inherit** the way font or color might.
    
- Some elements (especially block-level elements like `section`, `div`, `article`) **have browser default styles** that override what you set on `body`.
    
- You’ll still get inconsistent behavior unless you explicitly set it on **every element**.
    

---

## 💥 The Real-World Problem

You apply `box-sizing: border-box` to `body`, then add padding to a `section`, and…  
boom 💥 the layout still breaks.

Why?

Because that `section` didn’t **inherit** the box-sizing rule.  
The browser applied its **default `content-box` behavior** instead.

---

## 🛠 The Fix — Use the Universal Selector

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This rule says:

> “Every single element, regardless of tag or type, should use `border-box` for its sizing model.”

### Even better:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This also targets **pseudo-elements**, like `::before` and `::after`, which are often used for decoration or layout tricks.

---

## 📦 What This Fix Gives You

✅ No more overflowing boxes  
✅ Padding and borders fit cleanly inside your widths  
✅ Consistent layouts across browsers and devices  
✅ Less mental math and fewer bugs

It's simple, clean, and removes one of the most common sources of layout headaches — especially for beginners.

---

## 💼 This Is Industry Standard

If you peek into **popular CSS resets** or frameworks:

- Bootstrap
    
- Normalize.css
    
- Tailwind CSS
    
- Foundation
    

You’ll find this snippet (or a variation of it) right at the top:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

They use it **not just for convenience** — but to ensure every developer starts from a **known, controlled box model.**

---

## ⚠️ Why We _Rarely_ Use the Universal Selector Otherwise

In general, `*` is a **powerful but risky** selector. It applies styles to **every single element**, which can be inefficient or lead to unintentional overrides.

But in this case — `box-sizing` — it’s the perfect use case:

- It’s safe.
    
- It’s performance-friendly.
    
- It doesn’t conflict with component styles.
    

📌 In short: **this is one of the only times you _should_ use `*` confidently**.

## ✅ Recap

|Concept|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|`box-sizing` does not inherit|You can't rely on `body` styling|
|Browser defaults interfere|Many tags reset `box-sizing` internally|
|`*` selector targets everything|Forces consistency|
|`::before` and `::after` too?|Yes — include them|
|Common in frameworks?|Yes — always included in modern CSS resets|

---

## 🚀 Best Practice

At the top of every stylesheet, add this:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Then never worry about weird box behavior again. ✅
