# 🧱 Part 5 Deep Dive: Building a Responsive Hero Section Using the Box Model

---

## 🎯 Objective

Now that you understand:

- how `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` work together,
    
- how `box-sizing: border-box` simplifies layout,
    
- and how to control size predictably...
    

Let’s **build a full-screen hero section** that looks clean, works on all screens, and behaves _exactly as expected_.

---

## 🧩 What’s a Hero Section?

A “hero” is the **top-most section** of a webpage. It’s usually a bold, full-page area that contains:

- A background color or image
    
- A main heading (`<h1>`)
    
- A supporting paragraph or subtitle
    
- A call-to-action button
    

And it's commonly **centered both vertically and horizontally**.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Breakdown

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Fullscreen Sizing With Viewport Units

```css
.hero {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

- `100vw` = 100% of the **viewport width**
    
- `100vh` = 100% of the **viewport height**
    

This creates a section that fills the screen regardless of device size.  
✅ **No need for a height chain** (`html`, `body`, `main`...).

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Make Box Sizing Predictable

Apply globally (in your base CSS):

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This ensures that **all widths and heights include padding and border**.  
No more unexpected overflow or layout bugs.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Add Internal Padding Without Breaking Layout

```css
.hero {
  padding: 2rem;
}
```

Thanks to `border-box`, this padding stays _within_ the 100vh height — not added on top of it.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Center the Content With Flexbox

```css
.hero {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;       /* vertical centering */
  justify-content: center;   /* horizontal centering */
}
```

Wrap your heading, paragraph, and button in a `<div>` to keep them grouped together, and they’ll stay perfectly centered.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Style Internals With Margin, Not Padding

Use `margin` between internal elements (like the heading and button) so that:

- You get vertical spacing
    
- The layout remains clean and precise
    

```css
.hero h1 {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
.hero p {
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
```

Margins affect spacing **between elements**, not element size.  
Perfect for layout gaps.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Make It Responsive With Media Queries

At smaller screen sizes, shift from a horizontal layout to a stacked vertical one and reduce padding.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero {
    padding: 1rem;
    flex-direction: column;
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

This ensures your hero looks good on all devices — phones, tablets, desktops.
