### Explanation of Background Positioning

#### 1. **Pixel Values**

- **Usage**: You can specify values in pixels (e.g., `20px`).
- **Behavior**:
    - First value affects the x-axis (horizontal).
    - Second value affects the y-axis (vertical).
- Example:
    
    ```css
    background-position: 20px 50px;
    ```
    
    - Image is shifted **20px to the right** and **50px down** from the top-left corner of the container.

#### 2. **Percentage Values**

- **Usage**: Percentages define how excess space (parts of the image outside the container) is distributed.
- **Behavior**:
    - `0%`: Aligns the edge of the image with the corresponding edge of the container.
    - `50%`: Centers the image.
    - `100%`: Aligns the opposite edge of the image with the edge of the container.
- Example:
    
    ```css
    background-position: 10% 10%;
    ```
    
    - 10% of excess space is cropped at the top and left, shifting the image slightly down and right.

#### 3. **Predefined Keywords**

- **Keywords**: `center`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`.
- **Behavior**:
    - `center`: Equivalent to `50% 50%`, centers the image in both axes.
    - `left top`: Aligns the left and top edges of the image to the container, equivalent to `0% 0%`.
    - `left bottom`: Aligns the left edge and bottom of the image, equivalent to `0% 100%`.

#### 4. **Combining Units**

- You can mix percentages and pixel values for precise control.
- Example:
    
    ```css
    background-position: 10% 20px;
    ```
    
    - Crops 10% of excess space horizontally and positions the image 20px down vertically.

#### 5. **Default Behavior**

- If only one value is provided, the other defaults to `50%` (centered).
- Example:
    
    ```css
    background-position: 20px;
    ```
    
    - Image is moved 20px to the right and vertically centered.

#### 6. **Practical Usage**

- To align the center of the image:
    
    ```css
    background-position: center;
    ```
    
- To display specific edges:
    
    ```css
    background-position: left top;
    ```
    
- To fine-tune cropping:
    
    ```css
    background-position: 10% 30%;
    ```
