### Key Takeaways from the Topic

1. **Shorthand Background Property**:
    
    - The `background` shorthand allows combining multiple background-related properties into one line.
    - Syntax: `background: [color/image] [position] / [size] [repeat] [origin/clip] [attachment];`
2. **Order of Properties**:
    
    - Position (`left 10% bottom 20%`) comes first, followed by a slash `/` to separate it from the size (`cover`).
    - Example: `background: url("freedom.jpg") left 10% bottom 20% / cover no-repeat border-box;`
3. **Positioning and Sizing**:
    
    - Positions can use percentages or pixels.
    - Size values (`cover`, `contain`, etc.) are defined after a `/`.
4. **Background Repeat**:
    
    - `no-repeat` specifies that the background image should not repeat.
    - If no conflicting property values exist, they can easily be included in shorthand.
5. **Origin and Clip**:
    
    - When both values are the same (`border-box`), only one needs to be defined.
    - If you need different values, the first value defines the origin, and the second defines the clip.
6. **Background Attachment**:
    
    - Additional properties like `fixed`, `local`, or `scroll` can be included.
7. **Simplifying CSS**:
    
    - Combining multiple properties into shorthand reduces redundancy and makes the code cleaner.
    - Commenting out redundant properties helps test the shorthand for equivalent functionality.
8. **Practical Use**:
    
    - The `background` shorthand makes managing background images and styles more efficient.
    - Experimenting with properties like `attachment` and `size` can create dynamic visuals.

With these optimizations applied, the code achieves the same result as individual properties but in a concise and professional manner. This approach ensures clarity and maintainability.
