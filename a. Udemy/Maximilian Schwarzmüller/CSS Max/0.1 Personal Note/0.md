## 💥 Realization: The `h1` Has a Default Margin

> “Notice something interesting: even if we didn’t add margin to the `.hero` section, it still has space above it. Why?”

- Select the `<h1>` inside the section
    
- In DevTools, scroll to the “Browser Styles” or “User Agent Styles”
    
- You’ll see:
    
    ```css
    h1 {
      margin-block-start: 19.92px;
      margin-block-end: 19.92px;
    }
    ```
    

✅ This is **default browser styling**.

> “So it’s the heading's margin, not the section’s, that’s creating that gap.”
