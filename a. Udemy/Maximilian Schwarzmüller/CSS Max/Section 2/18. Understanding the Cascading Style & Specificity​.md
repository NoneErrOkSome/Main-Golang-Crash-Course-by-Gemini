Here’s a **structured summary for note-taking** based on the lecture:

## 🧠 CSS Specificity & Cascade — Key Takeaways

### 🔹 Why Styles Seem to "Overwrite" Each Other

- A tag (like `h1`) and a class (like `.section-title`) can **both match** the same element.
    
- **Class selectors** can overwrite tag styles **even if defined earlier** in the CSS file.
    
- Simply changing the **order in the file** doesn’t always change which rule wins.

### 🧩 Two Concepts at Play

1. **Cascade**
    
    - **Cascading Style Sheets** = multiple rules can apply to the same element.
        
    - When conflicts occur, the browser needs a way to decide which rule wins.
        
2. **Specificity**
    
    - CSS uses **specificity** to resolve conflicts between rules.
        
    - The rule with **higher specificity** wins, **regardless of order** in the file (except for ties).

### 🎯 Specificity Hierarchy (From Lowest to Highest)

|Selector Type|Specificity Level|
|---|---|
|Universal selector (`*`)|Lowest|
|Type selector (`h1`)|Low|
|Class selector (`.title`) / attribute / pseudo-class|Medium|
|ID selector (`#main`)|High|
|Inline style (`style=""`)|Highest|

⚠️ Even if a **type selector** comes later in the file, it can be **overwritten by a class** because the class has higher specificity.

### 🛠 Developer Tools Insights

- Open DevTools (`F12` or right-click → **Inspect**).
    
- Go to the **Elements tab**.
    
- Select an element and see all styles applied (from **bottom to top** = low to high priority).
    
- Inline styles appear at the top = **highest specificity**.
    
- Conflicting styles are **crossed out** if overridden by higher specificity.
    

---

### 🧪 Example Behavior

- `.section-title { color: green; }` overrides `h1 { color: white; }`
    
- But `h1 { font-family: Anton; }` is still kept if the class doesn’t define font-family.
    

🧠 That’s because **styles don’t "reset"** unless explicitly declared.

---

### 💡 Practical Tip

- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
    
- Be aware of how **class vs tag vs ID selectors** interact.
    
- When debugging, check **specificity and cascading** in DevTools.
