For **Part 1: Layout and Structure**, I would need **3 subparts** to cover all the topics logically:

### **1.1 Fundamentals of Layouts**

Covers the basics of CSS, including box model, display properties, and basic positioning, to establish a foundational understanding of how layouts work.

### **1.2 Flexible Layout Systems**

Focuses on advanced layout techniques, including Flexbox and Grid, which are the modern standards for creating flexible and responsive designs.

### **1.3 Page-Wide Positioning and Structure**

Covers topics like fixed, relative, and absolute positioning, Z-index, stacking context, and how to structure an entire page layout cohesively.

This ensures we move progressively from the basics to mastering advanced layout systems and page-wide structural concepts. Would you like me to organize the topics into these subparts?
