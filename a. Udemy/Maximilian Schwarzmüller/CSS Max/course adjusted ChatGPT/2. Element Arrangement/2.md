For **Part 2: Element Arrangement**, I would need **2 subparts** to cover the related topics:

### **2.1 Sizing, Spacing, and Alignment**

Focuses on how individual elements are sized, spaced, and aligned within a layout.

### **2.2 Flow and Order Management**

Covers the flow of elements, including stacking, overflow handling, and arranging elements in a logical or visual sequence.

This ensures a smooth progression from understanding the individual element adjustments to managing how elements behave and interact within a layout. Would you like me to proceed with listing the related topics for these subparts?
