For **Part 3: Styling and Decoration**, I would need **3 subparts** to cover the topics effectively:

### **3.1 Typography and Text Styling**

Focuses on fonts, text-related properties, and enhancing the readability of content.

### **3.2 Visual Enhancements**

Covers colors, backgrounds, shadows, and other decorative elements that visually enhance the page.

### **3.3 Transitions and Animations**

Includes topics related to adding dynamic effects like transitions, animations, and interactivity to improve the user experience.

This structure ensures we move progressively from textual styles to overall visual appeal and then to dynamic interactions. Would you like me to proceed with listing the related topics for these subparts?
