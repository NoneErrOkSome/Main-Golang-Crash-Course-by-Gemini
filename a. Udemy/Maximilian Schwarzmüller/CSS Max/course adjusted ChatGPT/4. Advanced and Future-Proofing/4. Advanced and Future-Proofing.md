For **Part 4: Advanced and Future-Proofing**, I would need **3 subparts** to cover the topics comprehensively:

### **4.1 CSS Best Practices and Modular Design**

Covers topics related to writing clean, maintainable, and modular CSS, including CSS variables, naming conventions, and detecting browser support.

### **4.2 Advanced CSS Tools and Features**

Includes Sass and its features like nesting, variables, and mixins, which streamline CSS development.

### **4.3 Cross-Browser Compatibility and Optimization**

Focuses on ensuring the CSS works consistently across different browsers using polyfills, prefixes, and resolving inconsistencies.

This division ensures a progression from writing effective CSS to leveraging tools and optimizing for broader compatibility. Would you like me to proceed with listing the related topics for these subparts?
