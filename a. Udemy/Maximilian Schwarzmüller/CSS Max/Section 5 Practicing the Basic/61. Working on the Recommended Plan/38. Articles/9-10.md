### **9/15: When to Use "The"**

**"The"** is used for both **singular, plural, countable, and uncountable nouns** when referring to something specific or unique.

#### Rule 1: Use "the" when there is only one of something.

- _Our planet goes round **the sun.**_
- _The moon orbits our planet._

#### Rule 2: Use "the" with specific, unique things.

- _The king addressed the people._ (There’s only one king.)
- _The Prime Minister gave a speech._ (There’s only one prime minister in the context.)

### Key Note:

Sometimes, we do **not** use "the" with proper names like **planets** (e.g., _Jupiter, Saturn_) or **countries** (e.g., _France, Russia_). However, for unique common nouns like **the sun** or **the moon,** "the" is required.

### **10/15: Using "The" When It's Clear Which One You Mean**

We use **"the"** when it’s clear to both the speaker and listener which specific item or group is being referred to. This is often the case after the first mention or when context makes it obvious.

#### Examples:

1. **After the first mention:**
    
    - _I saw **a lizard** in the bushes. **The lizard** quickly hid behind a rock._
2. **Contextual clarity:**
    
    - _I took **the kids** to school._  
        (It’s clear these are _my_ kids, not random children.)
    - _I parked **the car** opposite **the post office.**_  
        ("The car" refers to my car, and "the post office" likely means my local one.)

#### Key Rule:

Use **"the"** when the noun is already known or specific due to context.
