### **3/15: Singular, Countable Nouns Only**

You can only use **"a" and "an"** with singular, countable nouns. These are nouns that represent one thing and can be counted.

#### Examples:

- Correct: _a banana_ (singular and countable)
- Incorrect: _a bananas_ (plural)
- Correct: _an onion_ (singular and countable)
- Incorrect: _an onions_ (plural)

You **cannot** use **"a" or "an"** with:

1. **Plural nouns**:
    - _a men_ → Incorrect
    - _a children_ → Incorrect
2. **Uncountable nouns**:
    - _a sugar_ → Incorrect (because sugar is uncountable on its own)
    - _an information_ → Incorrect (information is also uncountable)

#### Exception for Uncountable Nouns:

Sometimes, you can use **"a" or "an"** if you describe a **unit** of the uncountable noun, like:

- _a spoon of sugar_
- _a piece of information_

### Key Point:

Use **"a" or "an"** only with **singular** and **countable nouns.**

### **4/15: Using "A" and "An" When Introducing Something for the First Time**

When you mention something for the **first time**, use **"a" or "an"** to introduce it. This shows that the noun is new and not something the listener is already familiar with.

#### Example:

- _When we were on holiday, we saw **a lizard** in the bushes._  
    The word "lizard" is new to the listener, so we use **"a"** because it's the first time it's being mentioned.

After the first mention, use **"the"** to refer to the same noun, as it becomes specific:

- _The lizard quickly hid behind a rock._  
    Now, both the speaker and listener know which lizard is being discussed.

### Important Rule:

1. First mention: Use **"a" or "an."**
2. Second and later mentions: Use **"the."**
