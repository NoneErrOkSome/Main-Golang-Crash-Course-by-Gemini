### **5/15: Using "A" and "An" to Define or Describe**

We use **"a" or "an"** when explaining what something **is** or what someone **does.** This is common when giving definitions or describing roles or professions.

#### Examples:

1. **Explaining what something is:**
    
    - _This is **a pen.**_
    - _A car is **a machine** that takes you from one place to another._
2. **Explaining what someone does (professions):**
    
    - _He is **a teacher.**_
    - _She works in **a restaurant** and is **a waitress.**_
3. **Past descriptions:**
    
    - _This building was **a restaurant** a year ago._

### Key Point:

Use **"a" or "an"** when identifying or defining a noun or describing someone's job.

### **6/15: Using "A" and "An" After "There Is"**

When you use the phrase **"there is"** to introduce something for the first time, always use **"a" or "an"** if the noun is singular and countable. This is because you are affirming or stating the existence of something.

#### Examples:

1. _There is **a Tesla coil** in the corner of my shed._
2. _There is **a God**, and I can prove it._

### Key Rule:

- **"There is" + singular, countable noun → "a" or "an."**

### Note:

This rule doesn’t apply to plural or uncountable nouns:

- _There is information available._ (No article before uncountable nouns like "information.")
- _There are apples on the table._ (No "a" or "an" before plural nouns.)
