### **13/15: Using "No Article" in Common Phrases and Prepositions**

There are specific expressions, especially with prepositions, where we do not use any article (**no "a," "an," or "the"**), even if the noun is countable in other contexts.

#### Examples:

1. **With Prepositions:**
    
    - _We went home._ (No "the" or "a.")
    - _We got there by train, by car, or on foot._  
        (_Train, car,_ and _foot_ don’t take articles in these expressions.)
2. **Specific Situations:**
    
    - _At school, at university, in hospital, in prison._  
        (When referring to general purposes, these phrases omit articles.)
        - _He’s in hospital._ → Means the person is there as a patient.
3. **Fixed Phrases:**
    
    - _My house was on fire._ (Not _on a fire_ or _on the fire._)
    - _I’ll go to bed early._ (Not _to the bed_ or _to a bed._)

### Key Rule:

In fixed expressions and certain prepositional phrases, articles are omitted regardless of countability.

### **14/15: Using "No Article" with Meals and Fixed Expressions**

We often omit articles (**no "a," "an," or "the"**) in expressions related to meals, routines, or specific fixed phrases.

#### Examples:

1. **Meals:**
    
    - _I had breakfast, lunch, and dinner._  
        (No article is used when referring to meals as part of daily routines.)
        - But: _I had **a wonderful breakfast.**_  
            (Here, an article is used because we’re describing the meal specifically.)
2. **Fixed Expressions:**
    
    - _By accident, on purpose_ → No article:
        - _I stepped on his foot **by accident**._
        - _He broke the vase **on purpose**._
    - _Have breakfast, have lunch_ → No article:
        - _We’ll have lunch at noon._
3. **Special Usage:**
    
    - _Go to bed, go to work, go to school_ → No article:
        - _I’ll go to bed early tonight._
        - _She goes to school every day._

### Key Rule:

For meals, routines, and certain idiomatic phrases, **omit the article.**
