### **1/15: What are Articles?**

Articles are small words placed before nouns, and they help specify whether you're talking about something general or specific. In English, we have **"a," "an,"** and **"the."** Sometimes, there’s **no article** at all. These words are often grouped under the term **"determiners,"** which also includes other words like "this," "that," "some," etc.

- **"A" and "an"** are indefinite articles, meaning they refer to any one of a group (not something specific).
- **"The"** is a definite article, which refers to something specific or already known.
- **No article** is used before plural or uncountable nouns in general statements.

### Key Point:

We use **"a" or "an"** for general, singular, and countable nouns. Whether we use "a" or "an" depends on the **sound** (not just the first letter) of the word that follows.

### **2/15: When to Use "A" and "An"**

**"A" and "An"** are the same word in purpose but are used differently depending on the sound that follows:

- **Use "an"** before vowel sounds (_a, e, i, o, u_).
    - Examples:
        - _an orange_ (starts with the "o" vowel sound)
        - _an umbrella_ (starts with the "u" vowel sound)
        - _an MP_ (although "M" is a consonant, the sound is like "em," which starts with a vowel sound)
- **Use "a"** before other sounds (consonant sounds).
    - Examples:
        - _a university_ (starts with "yu" sound, not a vowel sound)
        - _a year_ (starts with "yuh" sound, not a vowel)

### Important Rule:

It’s about **sound**, not the written letter. For example:

- _an onion_ (vowel sound "o").
- _a university_ (not "ou," but "yu").
