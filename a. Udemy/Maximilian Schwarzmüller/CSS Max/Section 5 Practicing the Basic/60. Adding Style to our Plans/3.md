### 3/9: **Initial Styling for the Plans**

To make the plans section visually appealing, basic styles were applied to each plan using the `.plan` class. This ensures consistency in appearance across all plans while providing a clean and organized layout.

#### Styles Applied:

1. **Background Color**:
    - A light green shade (`#d5ffdc`) was chosen to align with the site's theme and make the section visually inviting.
2. **Text Alignment**:
    - Centered all text inside the plan (`text-align: center`) to ensure readability and a neat look.
3. **Padding and Margin**:
    - `padding: 16px` added space inside the plan boxes.
    - `margin: 8px` added spacing between the plans and other elements.
4. **Display**:
    - Set to `inline-block` to allow the plans to align horizontally.
5. **Width**:
    - Restricted each plan's width to `30%` of the container to fit three plans in one row.

#### Example:

```css
.plan {
  background: #d5ffdc;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 16px;
  margin: 8px;
  display: inline-block;
  width: 30%;
}
```

This styling laid the foundation for the section's visual structure while setting the stage for further enhancements.
