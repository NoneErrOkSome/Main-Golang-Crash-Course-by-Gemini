### 7/9: **Responsive Considerations**

While the plans currently align side-by-side on larger screens, this layout can look awkward or break entirely on smaller devices. The next step involves planning for responsiveness, ensuring the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

#### Challenges on Small Screens:

1. **Overlapping Content**:
    - When the screen width is too narrow, the `30%` width for each plan may cause the content to shrink or overlap.
2. **Readability**:
    - Text and buttons may become too small or cramped, reducing usability.

#### Planned Solution:

- Use **media queries** to adjust the layout for smaller devices:
    - Stack the plans vertically for screens below a certain width (e.g., 768px).
    - Adjust padding and font sizes to improve readability on small screens.

#### Example (Media Query for Stacking Plans):

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .plan {
    display: block; /* Stack plans vertically */
    width: 90%; /* Use most of the available width */
    margin: 16px auto; /* Center-align each plan with spacing */
  }
}
```

This ensures the plans remain functional and visually appealing across various devices.
