### 9/9: **Final Touches and Next Steps**

After laying the foundational styles and structure, the final touch involves refining the middle (recommended) plan and preparing for future enhancements like responsive design and further styling tweaks.

#### Highlighting the Recommended Plan:

- Applied additional styles to make the "RECOMMENDED" plan stand out:
    - **Unique Background Color**: A slightly brighter or darker shade to distinguish it.
    - **Border or Shadow**: Added a border or shadow effect to draw attention.
    - **Font Emphasis**: Increased font size or weight for critical elements like the title or price.

#### Example (Final CSS for Recommended Plan):

```css
.plan.recommended {
  background: #a4f3a1; /* Brighter green */
  border: 3px solid #2ddf5c;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  transform: scale(1.05); /* Slight enlargement */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth hover effect */
}

.plan.recommended:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Slightly larger on hover */
}
```

#### Preparing for Responsive Design:

- Future work includes:
    - Ensuring the layout adapts well on small screens using `@media` queries.
    - Limiting the maximum width of the plans on large screens to avoid excessive stretching.

#### Example (Responsive Adjustments for Small Screens):

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .plan {
    width: 100%; /* Full width for stacking */
    margin: 16px 0;
  }
}
```

#### Summary of Current Achievements:

- The plans section now has a structured, styled layout with emphasis on the recommended plan.
- Buttons and features are styled to improve interactivity and readability.
- The groundwork for responsive design is in place, ensuring future scalability.
