### 2/9: **Adding the Content for the Plans Section**

To enhance the plans section, the placeholder paragraph was replaced with detailed content. This includes multiple `<article>` elements, each representing a hosting plan. Each plan contains the following components:

- **Name of the Plan:** A title (`<h1>`), such as "FREE," "PLUS," or "PREMIUM."
- **Price:** A price tag (`<h2>`), such as "$0/month."
- **Description:** A subtitle (`<h3>`) briefly describing the plan's purpose.
- **Features:** A list (`<ul>`) of key offerings, like "10GB Storage" or "Priority Support."
- **Action Button:** A call-to-action button (`<button>`) labeled "CHOOSE PLAN."

#### Example:

```html
<article class="plan">
  <h1>PREMIUM</h1>
  <h2>$99/month</h2>
  <h3>Your enterprise solution.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>10 Workspaces</li>
    <li>Unlimited Traffic</li>
    <li>Unlimited Storage</li>
    <li>Priority Support</li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    <button>CHOOSE PLAN</button>
  </div>
</article>
```

The plans were added in a way that aligns with real-world use cases, like hosting services, ensuring practical and realistic representation.
