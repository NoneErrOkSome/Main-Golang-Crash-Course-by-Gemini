### 6/9: **Aligning Plans in a Row**

To display the plans side-by-side in a single row, the `inline-block` display property was used. Additional adjustments, such as setting the width of each plan to `30%`, ensure the plans fit neatly across the row while maintaining adequate spacing.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Inline-Block Display**:
    
    - Allows elements to sit next to each other while behaving like block elements for width and height.
    - Applied to the `.plan` class to align all three plans horizontally.
2. **Width Adjustment**:
    
    - Each plan was given a width of `30%` to ensure that three plans fit into the container without breaking into a new row.
3. **Margin for Spacing**:
    
    - A vertical margin of `8px` creates space between rows (useful for responsive layouts later).

#### Example:

```css
.plan {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 30%;
  margin: 8px;
}
```

#### Notes on Responsiveness:

- While this layout works well on larger screens, it becomes problematic on smaller devices. For example, the plans may become too narrow or overlap.
- This issue will be addressed later with responsive design techniques, such as using media queries to stack the plans vertically on small screens.
