### 4/9: **Centering the Section Title**

The section title, "Choose Your Plan," was centered to improve its alignment and make it visually cohesive with the content below. This adjustment ensures that the title draws attention and aligns with the overall design.

#### Change Made:

- The CSS property `text-align: center` was added to the `.section-title` class. This centers all inline content within the element, which in this case is the `<h1>` title.

#### Example:

```css
.section-title {
  color: #2ddf5c;
  text-align: center;
}
```

This small but significant change improves the readability and focus of the section title, making the design more user-friendly.
