### 1/9: **Introduction and Current State of the Page**

The current webpage has a section titled "Choose Your Plan," where different hosting plans are displayed. This section includes basic placeholders for plans but lacks proper styling and content. Itâ€™s not visually appealing yet, and its layout can be improved to better guide users. The goal is to transform this into a polished and user-friendly section with styled plans, a highlighted recommended option, and responsive behavior for different screen sizes.

#### Example:

- **Before Improvement:**
    
    - A plain text paragraph or basic articles describing the plans.
    - No visual hierarchy or emphasis to direct the user.
- **Goal:**
    
    - Add visually distinct styles to each plan.
    - Highlight the recommended plan to make it stand out.
    - Center the "Choose Your Plan" heading for better alignment.
