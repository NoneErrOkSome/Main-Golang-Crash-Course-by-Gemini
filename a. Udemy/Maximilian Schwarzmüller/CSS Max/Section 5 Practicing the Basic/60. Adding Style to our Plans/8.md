### 8/9: **Styling Plan Features and Buttons**

To make the plans more user-friendly and visually engaging, the features list and buttons were styled. These elements are critical for usability and must complement the overall design.

#### Features List Styling:

1. **Bullet Points**:
    - Removed default list styles for a cleaner look.
2. **Spacing**:
    - Added padding or line height between items to improve readability.
3. **Font Size**:
    - Slightly increased font size for better visibility.

#### Example (CSS for Features List):

```css
.plan ul {
  list-style: none; /* Remove default bullets */
  padding: 0;
  margin: 10px 0;
}

.plan ul li {
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding: 4px 0;
}
```

#### Button Styling:

1. **Background and Color**:
    - Applied a background color consistent with the plan theme (e.g., green for positive actions).
2. **Padding and Border**:
    - Added padding and rounded borders for a modern look.
3. **Hover Effects**:
    - Enhanced interactivity by changing the button's appearance on hover.

#### Example (CSS for Buttons):

```css
.plan button {
  background: #2ddf5c;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.plan button:hover {
  background: #24c351; /* Darker green on hover */
}
```

#### Outcome:

The features list looks organized, and the buttons are visually distinct, inviting users to take action.
