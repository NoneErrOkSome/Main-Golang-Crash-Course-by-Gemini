Let's start with the first quarter of the list, covering points 1 to 6:

---

### 1. **Get off on something**

- **Definition**: To become sexually excited by something.
- **Expansions**:
    - **Turn somebody on**: This means something makes someone feel sexually aroused. It could be anything like a particular look, behavior, or style that creates sexual excitement in someone.
    - **Come on to somebody**: This involves trying to flirt or initiate romantic or sexual interest with someone. The person making the move is being direct about their feelings or attraction.
    - **Hit on somebody**: This phrase is similar to "come on to somebody." It means trying to start a romantic or sexual relationship with someone, often in a casual or confident manner. Usually, it includes approaching someone and expressing interest directly or indirectly.

All these phrases involve some aspect of attraction or sexual excitement, but they do have different nuances:

- "Get off on something" is more focused on an internal reaction to something specific.
- "Turn somebody on" implies causing someone to feel attracted.
- "Come on to" and "hit on" involve active behavior towards someone else.

### 2. **Turn somebody on / Turn somebody off**

- **Turn somebody on**: Causes excitement, often sexual in nature.
    - For example, a certain smell or type of music might turn someone on.
- **Turn somebody off**: The opposite, meaning to cause disinterest or even disgust.
    - Example: Rudeness might turn someone off.
    - It's common to say, "It turns me off when people are rude." This means the behavior makes you lose interest or feel negative emotions about someone.

This pair illustrates how attraction and repulsion can be described similarly:

- "Turn on" increases attraction.
- "Turn off" decreases it or creates aversion.

### 3. **Come on to somebody / Hit on somebody / Chat someone up**

- **Come on to somebody**: Trying to flirt or make romantic advances.
- **Hit on somebody**: More casual and direct than "come on to somebody," often implying a confident or bold attempt to show interest.
- **Chat someone up**: Involves talking to someone, trying to impress them, often with the goal of getting their contact information or arranging a date.
    - Example: If someone is "chatting you up," they’re trying to use conversation to make you like them romantically.

All these phrases relate to making romantic advances, but "chat someone up" emphasizes conversation as the approach. "Come on to" is broader and can include both verbal and physical gestures, while "hit on" implies a direct, often bold action.

### 4. **Get over something / Get over someone**

- **Get over something**: To recover from a difficult situation, such as an illness or a challenging period.
    - Typically refers to a minor illness, like a cold or flu.
    - Example: "It took him a few days to get over the flu." This implies recovery from something relatively mild.
- **Get over someone**: To recover emotionally from a breakup.
    - Example: "It took her months to get over her ex." When a relationship ends, and one person feels very upset, getting over them means moving past those emotions and no longer feeling sad about the end of the relationship.

**Related Phrases**:

- **Pull through**: To survive something serious, like a life-threatening illness. Usually used when someone is struggling with a significant health crisis.
    - Example: "He managed to pull through after the surgery."
- **Hold up** or **Bear up**: Both are used to describe someone staying strong or coping during a tough time, such as an illness or personal crisis.
    - Example: "She is holding up well after the accident." This suggests emotional or physical resilience.

**Summary**:

- "Get over" relates to recovery, but is often about more mild or emotional issues.
- "Pull through" is more intense, implying overcoming a severe crisis.
- "Hold up" or "Bear up" indicates ongoing resilience during difficulty.

### 5. **Get through to somebody**

- **Definition**: To successfully communicate with someone, ensuring they understand your message.
    - Often involves persistence, especially when the other person isn’t willing to listen or doesn't understand initially.
    - Example: "I tried to get through to my friend about saving money, but he wouldn't listen."

**Related Phrases**:

- **Bring somebody round**: To persuade someone to your point of view. It involves convincing someone until they agree with you.
    - Example: "She managed to bring her parents round to the idea of studying abroad."
- **Get round somebody**: This involves convincing or persuading someone by being nice or charming.
    - Example: "He got round his boss to get an extra day off."
- **Wrap somebody round your little finger**: To manipulate someone completely by being charming or persuasive.
    - Often used when someone is very good at convincing others to do things for them.
    - Example: "The little girl has her parents wrapped around her little finger."

These expressions all deal with the idea of communication and persuasion:

- "Get through" focuses on being understood.
- "Bring round" and "Get round" are about persuading others.
- "Wrap around your little finger" is more about full manipulation through charm.

### 6. **Get to somewhere**

- **Definition**: To arrive at a specific location.
    - Example: "Get to work," "Get to school," or "Get home."
    - Note: With "home," the preposition "to" is dropped ("get home" instead of "get to home").

**Related Phrase**:

- **Get at something**:
    - **Literal meaning**: To reach out for something physically.
        - Example: "He tried to get at the book on the top shelf."
    - **Figurative meaning**: To imply or mean something indirectly.
        - Example: "What are you getting at?" means "What are you trying to say?"

**Summary**:

- "Get to somewhere" is about reaching a physical location.
- "Get at" has both literal (reaching for an object) and figurative (implying something) meanings.
