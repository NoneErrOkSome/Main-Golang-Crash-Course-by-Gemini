#### 1. **Understanding Prepositions with Phrasal Verbs**

   - **Into + Noun / Out of + Noun**:
     - **Meaning**: The prepositions "into" and "out of" are used with objects, particularly when describing movement into or out of a place.
     - **Examples**:
       - "He came into the room" (into + the room as the object).
       - "She went out of the car" (out of + the car as the object).
     - **Explanation**: These prepositions are standard in formal English when describing entry or exit. The instructor emphasizes that in informal, everyday English, speakers often simplify and drop the "of" or "to," as in "He went out the room" or "He got in the car."

   - **In / Out (without an object)**:
     - **Meaning**: Used without objects when describing general entry or exit without specifying a place.
     - **Examples**:
       - "He came in and sat down" (no object).
       - "She went out quickly" (no object).
     - **Instructor’s Note**: In relaxed English, speakers might omit prepositions or simplify them, especially when no specific object is needed. This is acceptable in informal speech.

     - **Explanation**: "Into" and "out of" apply to private transport modes, which differ from public transport phrasal verbs. The instructor emphasizes that we only use these with vehicles you typically enter and exit privately.

   - **Get on / Get off**:
     - **Meaning**: Used with public transportation like buses, trains, planes, and boats.
     - **Examples**: "Get on a bus," "Get off a plane."

     - **Meaning**: To close or open a zipper.
     - **Examples**: "Zip up your jacket," "Unzip the backpack."
     - **Instructor’s Suggestion**: Learn these as pairs—zip and unzip—since they directly reflect closing and opening.

     - **Meaning**: "Wrap up" means to cover something fully, like a gift; "unwrap" means to remove the covering.

     - **Explanation**: "Wrap up" is commonly used for covering gifts, while "unwrap" is for opening them. They reflect the same concept of covering and uncovering.

#### 9. **Separable and Inseparable Phrasal Verbs**

   - **Separable Phrasal Verbs**:
     - **Examples**: "Turn it on," "Put it on."
     - **Rule**: In separable phrasal verbs, pronouns (like "it" or "them") go between the verb and the preposition, e.g., "turn it on," not "turn on it."
     - **Explanation**: The instructor clarifies that for separable verbs, placing the object between the verb and preposition is necessary.

   - **Inseparable Phrasal Verbs**:
     - **Examples**: "Look after him," "Look for it."
     - **Rule**: With inseparable phrasal verbs, the object must follow the entire verb phrase, e.g., "look after her," not "look her after."
     - **Instructor’s Note**: This rule is essential for correct usage, as inseparable verbs do not allow separation of their components.
