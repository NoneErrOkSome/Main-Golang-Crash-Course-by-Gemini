### Part 1/5: Understanding Modal Verbs

1. **What Are Modal Verbs?**
    
    - Modal verbs are a special type of verb that doesn’t change based on the subject.
    - For example, with modal verbs like **"can"** or **"will"**, you do not add **-s** for third-person singular (e.g., "he can," not "he cans").
2. **Key Features of Modal Verbs:**
    
    - **No "s" Form:** Unlike ordinary verbs (e.g., "he eats"), modal verbs stay the same (e.g., "he will").
    - **Fixed Negative Forms:** Modal verbs use specific contractions for negatives:
        - "will not" → "won’t"
        - "cannot" → "can’t"
        - "must not" → "mustn’t"
3. **No Auxiliary Verbs for Negatives:**
    
    - Modal verbs don’t use **don’t** or **doesn’t** for negatives. Instead, they have their own forms (e.g., "He can’t swim" instead of "He doesn’t can swim").
4. **Tense Limitations:**
    
    - Modal verbs cannot be used in continuous or past forms (e.g., no "willing" or "willed").
    - They have only one form (e.g., "will," "can," "must").

### Part 2/5: Differences Between Modal Verbs and Ordinary Verbs

1. **Ordinary Verbs Require Auxiliary Structures:**
    
    - When using two verbs together with ordinary verbs, the second verb usually follows one of these patterns:
        - **to + infinitive:** Example: "I want **to go**."
        - **gerund (-ing):** Example: "I suggest **going**."
2. **Modal Verbs Use Only the Bare Infinitive:**
    
    - With modal verbs, the second verb does not require "to" or "-ing":
        - Correct: "You should **ask** for help."
        - Incorrect: "You should **to ask** for help."
3. **Examples for Comparison:**
    
    - **Ordinary Verb:** "I want to eat dinner."
    - **Modal Verb:** "I can eat dinner."
    - **Ordinary Verb:** "I suggest taking the bus."
    - **Modal Verb:** "You must take the bus."
4. **Common Mistake with Modal Verbs:**
    
    - Students often add "to" after modal verbs, which is incorrect.
    - Example:
        - Correct: "You must leave now."
        - Incorrect: "You must to leave now."

### Part 3/5: Using Modal Verbs for Advice and Opinions

1. **"Should" and "Shouldn’t" for Advice:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Use "should" to give advice or express an opinion about what is a good idea.
    - **Structure:** "Should" + bare infinitive.
        - Example: "You should ask for directions."
2. **Examples of Giving Advice:**
    
    - **Scenario 1:** Someone is lost and cannot find their hotel.
        - Advice: "You should ask for directions."
    - **Scenario 2:** Someone makes spelling mistakes while writing essays.
        - Advice: "You should use a dictionary."
    - **Scenario 3:** Someone misses their family while living abroad.
        - Advice: "You should contact them on Skype."
    - **Scenario 4:** Someone struggles to remember English vocabulary and might fail an exam.
        - Advice: "You should take an English course."
3. **Key Points to Remember:**
    
    - Use "should" to suggest good ideas or actions.
    - Use "shouldn’t" to warn against bad ideas.
    - Always follow "should" with the base form of the verb:
        - Correct: "You should go."
        - Incorrect: "You should to go."
