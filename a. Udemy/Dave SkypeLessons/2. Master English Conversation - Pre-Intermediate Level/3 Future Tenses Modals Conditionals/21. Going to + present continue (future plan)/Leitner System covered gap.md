Here are a few minor gaps that could be briefly addressed for completeness without expanding too much:

1. **Using "going to" for imminent predictions**  
    Example: _Look at those clouds; it’s going to rain._  
    This could reinforce how **"going to"** is used for predictions based on evidence.
    
2. **Difference in emphasis between present continuous and "going to"**  
    Example:
    
    - _I’m meeting my friend tomorrow_ (fixed plan).
    - _I’m going to meet my friend tomorrow_ (decision made but less fixed).  
        A small note on the subtle difference in certainty could add value.
3. **Politeness in questions**  
    Example:
    
    - _Are you going anywhere this weekend?_ vs. _Do you have any plans this weekend?_  
        Highlighting how phrasing affects tone could help in conversational contexts.
4. **Combining "going to" with adverbs**  
    Example: _It’s definitely going to snow tomorrow._  
    Showing how to emphasize predictions using adverbs like _probably, definitely, maybe_.
    

These minor gaps can be addressed briefly with examples to make the system airtight, ensuring learners have a complete understanding without overwhelming them.
