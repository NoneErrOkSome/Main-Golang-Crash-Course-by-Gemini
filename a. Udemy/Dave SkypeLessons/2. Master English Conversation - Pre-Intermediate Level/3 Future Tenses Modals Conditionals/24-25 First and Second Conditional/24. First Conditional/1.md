### First Conditional Lesson Arrangement: Part 1/5

---

**1. Introduction to First Conditional**

The instructor begins the lesson by introducing the concept of the **first conditional** as one of several conditional sentence types in English. A conditional sentence uses the word **“if”** to describe a possible situation and its result. The lesson highlights that all conditionals (first, second, and third) use **“if”**, but the focus of this class is specifically on the **first conditional**.

**Key Explanation:**

- The first conditional is structured as **“if” + present simple**, followed by **“will” or “won’t”** for the result.
- Common error: Many learners mistakenly use **“will”** in both parts of the sentence (e.g., "if I will see"). This error often arises from translating directly from their native language. However, in English, **present simple** must follow **“if”**.

**Examples:**

- Correct: **"If I see him, I will give him your message."**
- Incorrect: **"If I will see him, I will give him your message."**

**Details:** The instructor emphasizes that using **“will”** after **“if”** is never correct in English, even though it might feel natural in other languages. The proper structure always requires **present simple** after **“if.”**

**Extended Example:**

- Changing **“if”** to **“when”** doesn’t change the rule:
    - **Correct:** "When I see him, I will give him your message."
    - **Incorrect:** "When I will see him, I will give him your message."

The instructor urges students to avoid this common mistake by practicing correct structures.

**2. Real-Life Application of First Conditional**

The first conditional is used for **real or likely situations**, where the condition is possible, and the result can happen.

**Example:**

- **"If it is sunny, we will have a picnic."**
- The structure works regardless of clause order:
    - **"If it is sunny, we will have a picnic."**
    - **"We will have a picnic if it is sunny."**

The instructor highlights that the same grammar rules apply, no matter which clause comes first. In both cases:

- **“If” + present simple** is mandatory.
- **“Will” or “won’t”** goes in the result clause.

**Practice Tip:**  
When swapping clauses, ensure the **“if”** part is still grammatically correct. For example:

- **"I will give him your message if I see him."**
- Still no **“will”** after **“if.”**

**3. Using Other Conjunctions with First Conditional**

Apart from **“if”**, the instructor introduces other conjunctions like **“when,” “before,” “after,” “until,” and “unless”**, which follow the same rules:

- Use **present simple** after these conjunctions instead of **“will.”**

**Examples:**

- **When I arrive, I will call you.** (Not: **“When I will arrive.”**)
- **Before I go to work, I will call him.** (Not: **“Before I will go to work.”**)
- **Until I finish reading, I will stay here.**
