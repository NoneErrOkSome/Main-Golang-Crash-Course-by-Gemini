**6. Practical Examples of First Conditional: Real-Life Scenarios**

The instructor provides practical examples to help students understand how to construct **first conditional** sentences. These examples highlight common real-life scenarios and encourage full sentence responses, adhering to the correct grammar structure.

#### **Example 1: Leaving for Work**

**Scenario:** "If you leave home at 8:30 tomorrow, will you be on time for work?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "If I leave home at 8:30 tomorrow, I will be late for work."
    - **OR:** "If I leave home at 8:30 tomorrow, I will be on time for work."

**Instructor’s Emphasis:**

- Note the correct structure: **“If I leave”** (present simple) + **“I will be”** (result).
- Never say: **“If I will leave…”**

#### **Example 2: Rainy Weather**

**Scenario:** "What will you do if it rains this weekend?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "If it rains this weekend, I will stay at home."
    - "If it rains this weekend, I won’t go out or have a picnic."

**Details:**

- **“If it rains”**: Present simple for the condition.
- **“I will stay” or “I won’t go”**: The future result.

The instructor adds a cultural note: Most people dislike rain, so staying home is a common response.

#### **Example 3: Arriving Early for a Flight**

**Scenario:** "What will happen if you arrive early for your flight?"

- **Correct Pessimistic Answer:**
    - "If I arrive early for my flight, it will be delayed."
    - "If I arrive early for my flight, it will be canceled."

**Instructor’s Explanation:**

- This is an example of **pessimistic predictions** using the first conditional.
- **Common Mistake:** Avoid saying **“If I will arrive early…”**

#### **Example 4: Wearing Best Clothes to a Party**

**Scenario:** "What will happen if you wear your best clothes to the party?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "If I wear my best clothes to the party, someone will spill wine on them."
    - "If I wear my best clothes, someone will ruin them."

**Additional Vocabulary:**

- **Spill:** To accidentally pour a liquid, often causing a mess.
- **Ruin:** To damage something badly, making it unusable or unpleasant.

The instructor humorously imagines a situation where someone spills wine, and you end up needing new clothes.

#### **Example 5: Driving in a Hurry**

**Scenario:** "What will happen if you are driving and in a hurry?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "If I am driving and in a hurry, my car will break down."
    - "If I am driving and in a hurry, I will get a puncture."

**Vocabulary Notes:**

- **Break down:** When a car stops working unexpectedly.
- **Puncture:** A flat tire caused by a sharp object piercing it.

**Explanation:**

- This example introduces **present continuous** after **“if”** (e.g., “If I am driving”), showing that continuous actions are also possible in the first conditional.

**7. Predictions with the First Conditional: The Shortest Queue**

The instructor discusses how first conditional sentences are often used to make predictions based on likely outcomes.

#### **Scenario:** "What will happen if you join the shortest queue?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "If I join the shortest queue, it will be the slowest."
    - "If I join the shortest queue, the other queues will move faster."

**Details:**

- The sentence reflects a pessimistic prediction, based on the expectation that shorter queues often seem slower in practice.
- Students are encouraged to think about personal experiences to relate to this prediction.
