### First Conditional Lesson Arrangement: Part 2/5

---

**4. Conjunctions in First Conditional: Detailed Explanation**

The instructor expands on how other conjunctions like **“when,” “before,” “after,” “until,”** and **“unless”** follow the same grammar rules as **“if”** in first conditional sentences. These conjunctions help connect two related ideas, just like **“if.”**

#### **When**

- **Rule:** Use the **present simple** after **“when”**, even when referring to future events.
- **Correct Example:**
    - "When I see him, I will tell him."
- **Incorrect Example:**
    - "When I will see him, I will tell him."

This rule reflects the logic of English grammar, where **“when”** does not allow **“will”** in the same clause.

#### **Before**

- **Meaning:** Describes something that happens earlier than another action.
- **Correct Example:**
    - "I will call him before I go to work."
- **Incorrect Example:**
    - "I will call him before I will go to work."

#### **Until**

- **Meaning:** Indicates continuity, describing an ongoing action up to a specific point in time.
- **Correct Example:**
    - "I will read this book until I go to work."
- **Incorrect Example:**
    - "I will read this book until I will go to work."

**Key Difference Between “Before” and “Until”:**

- **“Before”** focuses on finishing an action:
    - "I will read this book **before** I go to work." (You will stop reading before work begins.)
- **“Until”** emphasizes continuity:
    - "I will read this book **until** I go to work." (You will keep reading right up to the moment you leave.)

#### **After**

- **Meaning:** Refers to an action that happens following another.
- **Correct Example:**
    - "After I finish my homework, I will watch TV."
- **Incorrect Example:**
    - "After I will finish my homework, I will watch TV."

**5. Unless: The Negative “If”**

The instructor explains that **“unless”** means **“if not”** and is commonly used to describe negative conditions. Like **“if,”** it requires the **present simple** in the condition clause.

#### **Key Examples:**

- **“Unless it rains, we will have a picnic.”**
    - Equivalent to: **“If it doesn’t rain, we will have a picnic.”**
- **“Unless I fail all my exams, I will get a great job.”**
    - Equivalent to: **“If I don’t fail all my exams, I will get a great job.”**

#### **Common Errors with “Unless”:**

- Learners might mistakenly use **“will”** after **“unless.”** This is incorrect.
    - Incorrect: **“Unless it will rain, we will have a picnic.”**
    - Correct: **“Unless it rains, we will have a picnic.”**

#### **Extra Notes:**

- “Unless” introduces a negative condition and cannot be paired with another negative word like **“not.”**
    - Incorrect: **“Unless it doesn’t rain, we will have a picnic.”**
    - Correct: **“Unless it rains, we will have a picnic.”**
