### First Conditional Lesson Arrangement: Part 4/5

---

**8. Using Conjunctions with First Conditional**

The instructor provides additional examples to demonstrate how conjunctions like **“when,” “before,” “after,” “until,”** and **“unless”** function in sentences that look like the first conditional but don’t use **“if.”** These conjunctions are critical for expressing time relationships and negative conditions.

#### **When**

**Scenario:** "When will you get married?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "I will get married when I fall in love."
    - "I will get married when I meet the right person."

**Instructor’s Notes:**

- **“When I fall in love”**: Use **present simple** after **“when,”** not **“will.”**
- This structure emphasizes that the action is dependent on a future event but uses present tense grammar.

---

#### **Before**

**Scenario:** "What will you do before you go on holiday?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "Before I go on holiday, I will pack my book."
    - "Before I go on holiday, I will pack my clothes."

**Explanation:**

- **“Before I go”**: Present simple is used with **“before.”**
- The focus is on completing a task (e.g., packing) prior to the event of going on holiday.

#### **After**

**Scenario:** "What will you do after you finish your homework?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "After I finish my homework, I will watch TV."
    - "After I finish my homework, I will go to the beach."

**Key Point:**

- **“After I finish”**: Present simple follows **“after.”**
- Students are reminded to avoid saying **“after I will finish.”**

---

#### **Until**

**Scenario:** "Will you keep studying English until you finish this course?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "I will keep studying English until I finish this course."

**Explanation:**

- **“Until”** emphasizes continuity, describing an action that will persist up to a specific point.
- Example Comparison:
    - **“Until I finish”**: Continuous action leading to the course’s end.
    - **“Before I finish”**: Focuses on something that happens earlier than finishing the course.

---

#### **Unless**

**Scenario:** "What will you do unless you fail all your exams?"

- **Correct Answer:**
    - "Unless I fail all my exams, I will get a great job."

**Instructor’s Notes:**

- **“Unless I fail”**: Equivalent to **“If I don’t fail.”**
- Using **“unless”** highlights the negative condition without repeating a second negative word (e.g., “not”).
