#### **Key Grammar Rules:**

1. **Structure:**
    
    - **Condition Clause:** **“If” + past simple** (or **past continuous** for ongoing actions).
    - **Result Clause:** **“Would” or “Wouldn’t” + infinitive.**
2. **Meaning:**
    
    - Used for **unreal** or **unlikely situations** in the **present** or **future.**
3. **Subjunctive Mood:**
    
    - Use **“were”** instead of **“was”** for formal or polite speech in the condition clause.
    - Example: **“If I were president, I would abolish income tax.”**
4. **Avoiding Common Errors:**
    
    - Never use **“would”** in the **“if”** clause:
        - Incorrect: **“If I would win the lottery, I would buy a yacht.”**
        - Correct: **“If I won the lottery, I would buy a yacht.”**
