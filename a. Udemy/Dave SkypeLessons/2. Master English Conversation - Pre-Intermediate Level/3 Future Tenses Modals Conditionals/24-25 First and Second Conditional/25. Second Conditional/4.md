**13. The Subjunctive Mood in Detail**

The subjunctive is revisited, with a focus on its formality and specific usage in second conditional sentences.

        - Informal: **“If I was rich, I would travel the world.”**
2. **Why Use Subjunctive?**
    
    - It sounds formal and polite, often associated with **Queen’s English** or **King’s English**.
    - Some native speakers avoid it, but it is still widely understood and appreciated in formal writing or speech.
