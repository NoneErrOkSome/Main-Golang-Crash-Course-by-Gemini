### Second Conditional Lesson Arrangement: Part 3/5

---

**9. Comparing First and Second Conditionals**

The instructor contrasts **first** and **second conditionals** to highlight their differences in meaning, grammar, and usage.

#### **Real vs. Unreal Situations**

- **First Conditional:** For real or likely situations in the present or future.
    
    - Example: **“If I stay longer, I will miss my bus.”**
    - Explanation: There’s a high probability of missing the bus.
- **Second Conditional:** For unreal or unlikely situations in the present or future.
    
    - Example: **“If I won the lottery, I would buy a yacht.”**
    - Explanation: Winning the lottery is hypothetical and unlikely.

#### **Tense Usage**

- **First Conditional:** Uses **present simple** in the **“if”** clause and **“will” or “won’t”** in the result clause.
    
    - Example: **“If it rains, I will stay home.”**
- **Second Conditional:** Uses **past simple** in the **“if”** clause and **“would” or “wouldn’t”** in the result clause.
    
    - Example: **“If it rained, I would stay home.”**

**Key Note:**  
Despite using **past tense**, the second conditional refers to **present or future situations** and not the actual past.
