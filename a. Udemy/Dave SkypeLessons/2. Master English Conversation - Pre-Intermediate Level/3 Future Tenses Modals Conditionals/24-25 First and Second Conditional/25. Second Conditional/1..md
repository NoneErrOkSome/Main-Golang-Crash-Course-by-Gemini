### Second Conditional Lesson Arrangement: Part 1/5

---

**1. Introduction to Second Conditional**

The instructor begins by revisiting the **first conditional** from the previous lesson, explaining that it deals with **real or likely situations** (e.g., "If I stay longer, I will miss my bus."). It uses:

- **Present simple** in the condition clause (**“if” part**).
- **“Will” or “won’t” + infinitive** in the result clause.

However, the **second conditional** differs because it focuses on **unreal** or **unlikely situations**, with grammar structured as:

- **“If” + past simple** in the condition clause.
- **“Would” or “wouldn’t” + infinitive** in the result clause.

**Key Points on Unreal Situations:**

- These are situations with a low chance of occurring or that are completely hypothetical.
- Example: **“If I got pregnant, I would have a home birth.”**
    - **Explanation:** This situation is entirely unreal for the instructor, as it has a 0% chance of happening.

**2. Grammar Structure of Second Conditional**

The instructor dives into the grammatical framework, highlighting the components and nuances.

#### **Condition Clause: “If” + Past Simple**

- The **“if”** clause uses the **past simple** to describe an unreal or hypothetical condition.
- Example: **“If I won the lottery, I would buy a yacht.”**

#### **Result Clause: “Would” or “Wouldn’t” + Infinitive**

- The **result clause** describes what would happen if the unreal condition were true, using **“would”** or **“wouldn’t”** followed by the base form of the verb.
- Example: **“If I got pregnant, I would have a home birth.”**

#### **Modal Verbs in Second Conditional**

- Modal verbs like **“could”** or **“might”** are also common in the result clause to add variations of possibility or permission.
- Example: **“If I could travel anywhere, I would go to Thailand.”**

**3. Unreal Situations in the Present and Future**

**Explanation:**

- The second conditional is used to talk about unreal situations in the **present** or **future**, even though it uses **past tense** forms.

**Examples:**

1. **Present:** **“If I were rich, I would buy a mansion.”**
    - This implies the speaker is not rich at present.
2. **Future:** **“If I won the lottery tomorrow, I would buy a yacht.”**
    - This refers to a future scenario, despite the use of **past simple** in the **“if”** clause.

**Clarification on Grammar:**

- Using the **past tense** in the **“if”** clause to refer to future situations is a unique feature of English and can feel unusual.
- Example: **“If I were on a beach famous for shark attacks, I wouldn’t go swimming.”**

**4. Subjunctive in Second Conditional**

The instructor introduces the **subjunctive mood**, a formal and somewhat rare grammatical structure in modern English.

#### **When to Use Subjunctive:**

- The subjunctive is primarily used with **“were”** for all subjects (e.g., I, he, she, it).
- It sounds more formal and is often associated with **Queen’s English** or **King’s English.**

**Examples:**

1. **Formal Subjunctive:**
    - **“If I were rich, I would book a holiday in Thailand.”**
    - **“If he were my boss, I would resign immediately.”**
2. **Informal (Non-Subjunctive):**
    - **“If I was rich, I would book a holiday in Thailand.”**

**Vocabulary Related to Subjunctive Examples:**

- **Resign:** To quit a job voluntarily.
- **Sack/Fire:** When a boss forces an employee to leave.
- Example: **“If I were your boss, I would sack you.”**
