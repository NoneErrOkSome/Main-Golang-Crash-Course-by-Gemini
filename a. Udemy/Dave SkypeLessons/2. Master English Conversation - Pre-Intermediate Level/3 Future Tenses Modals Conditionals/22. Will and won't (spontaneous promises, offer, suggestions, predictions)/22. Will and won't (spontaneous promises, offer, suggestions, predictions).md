### Part 1/5: Introduction to "Will" and "Won't" and Their Usage

1. **Introduction to Future Tenses:**
    
    - In this class, the focus is on using **"will"** and **"won't"** to discuss the future.
    - **Comparison with Previous Lessons:** Previously, "going to" and the present continuous were used for future plans.
        - **Present Continuous:** Used for near-future actions.
        - **Going to:** Used for both plans and predictions, especially when evidence is present.
    - **"Will" and "Won't":** Suitable for general predictions without visible evidence.
2. **Understanding Modal Verbs:**
    
    - **Definition:** "Will" and "won't" are **modal verbs**.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Do not take **-s** with third-person singular subjects (e.g., "he will" instead of "he wills").
        - Always followed by the base form of the verb (e.g., "will go," "won't eat").
        - No other forms like ING or past tense exist for modal verbs.
3. **Using "Shall" with I/We:**
    
    - Questions with **"I"** or **"we"** often use **"shall"** instead of "will" (e.g., "Shall I come with you?").
    - Other pronouns like "they," "you," "he," or "she" use "will" or "won't" in questions.

### Part 2/5: Situational Uses of "Will" and "Won't"

1. **Spontaneous Actions:**
    
    - **Definition:** Use "will" and "won't" when making offers, suggestions, or promises spontaneously.
    - **Example (Offer):**
        - Situation: Someone is struggling with heavy luggage.
        - Response: "I'll carry both suitcases."
        - Not "I'm going to carry" or "I am carrying" because it’s a spontaneous decision.
2. **Making Offers and Suggestions:**
    
    - When someone expresses a need or problem, you can use "will" to offer help or make a suggestion.
    - **Examples:**
        - Someone says, "I'm starving."
            - Offer: "I'll make you a sandwich."
            - Suggestion: "Shall I make you a sandwich?"
        - A room is stuffy.
            - Offer: "I'll open the window."
            - Suggestion: "Shall I open the window?"
3. **First Conditional:**
    
    - **Structure:** Used to express a possible future outcome based on a present condition.
    - **Rule:** The **"if"** clause uses the **present tense**, while the main clause uses "will" or "won't."
        - Example:
            - "If you tell me your secret, I won't tell anyone."
            - Incorrect: "If you will tell me your secret, I won't tell anyone."
    - **Key Concept:** Present tense is mandatory after "if," even when referring to the future.

### Part 3/5: Examples of the First Conditional

1. **Structure of First Conditional Sentences:**
    
    - **Formula:**
        - **If clause** (present tense) + **Main clause** (will/won’t + base verb).
    - **Purpose:** Expresses future outcomes dependent on specific conditions.
2. **Examples:**
    
    - **Scenario 1:** Sharing a secret.
        
        - "If you tell me your secret, I won’t tell anybody."
        - Notes: "Anybody" is used in negatives, not "somebody."
    - **Scenario 2:** Fear of going alone.
        
        - "If you are scared to go on the ride alone, he will go with you."
        - Notes: Present tense in the condition ("if you are scared"), future tense in the result ("he will go").
    - **Scenario 3:** Providing required documents.
        
        - "If you don’t provide the embassy with the correct documents, you won’t get your visa."
        - Notes: "Provide" means "give," and the embassy requires accuracy.
3. **Swapping Clauses in the First Conditional:**
    
    - You can reverse the order of the clauses without changing the meaning.
    - Examples:
        - "If you tell me your secret, I won’t tell anybody." → "I won’t tell anybody if you tell me your secret."
        - "If you are scared to go on the ride alone, he will go with you." → "He will go with you if you are scared to go on the ride alone."
