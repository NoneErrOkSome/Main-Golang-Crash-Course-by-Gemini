Below are some additional flashcards that go beyond the transcript’s content. They address commonly confused areas, special cases, and related grammar points that will help deepen understanding.

**Flashcard 1**  
**Q:** How do you form comparatives and superlatives of “far”?  
**A:** “Far” has two acceptable comparative and superlative forms.  
_Distance meaning:_ far → farther → the farthest  
_Abstract meaning:_ far → further → the furthest

---

**Flashcard 2**  
**Q:** What is the difference between “than” and “then”?  
**A:** “Than” is used in comparisons (e.g., “bigger than,” “more expensive than”). “Then” refers to time or order (e.g., “We ate dinner, then watched a movie.”).

---

**Flashcard 3**  
**Q:** How do you form comparative and superlative forms of “little” and “few”?  
**A:**

- For uncountable nouns, use “less” and “the least” (e.g., less water, the least time).
- For countable plural nouns, use “fewer” and “the fewest” (e.g., fewer apples, the fewest mistakes).

---

**Flashcard 4**  
**Q:** How can you emphasize a superlative to show an extreme degree?  
**A:** Use intensifiers like “by far” or “easily.” For example, “This is by far the most interesting movie I’ve ever seen.”

---

**Flashcard 5**  
**Q:** Is “the” always required before a superlative form of an adjective?  
**A:** Generally, yes. Superlatives usually need “the” (e.g., the tallest, the most famous). However, in some expressions like “most interesting” used as an adverbial phrase meaning “very interesting,” “the” may be omitted (e.g., “It’s most interesting to note…”).

---

**Flashcard 6**  
**Q:** Can “more” and “most” be used with nouns, not just adjectives?  
**A:** Yes. “More” and “most” can also function as quantifiers. For example, “I need more time” or “She has the most friends.” In these cases, they are not forming comparatives or superlatives of adjectives but instead indicating quantity.

---

**Flashcard 7**  
**Q:** How do you compare actions using adverbs in the comparative form?  
**A:** For most adverbs, use “more” and “the most.” For example, “He drives more carefully than I do” and “He drives the most carefully of all the drivers.” Some short adverbs still take -er and -est (e.g., “fast → faster → fastest”).

---

**Flashcard 8**  
**Q:** When comparing actions or states, when would you use “as + adjective/adverb + as”?  
**A:** Use “as + adjective/adverb + as” to show equality. For example, “She sings as beautifully as her sister” or “This puzzle is as hard as the last one.”

---

**Flashcard 9**  
**Q:** How do you form the opposite of “as + adjective + as” to show something is less equal?  
**A:** Use “not as + adjective + as.” For example, “This restaurant is not as expensive as the other one.”

---

**Flashcard 10**  
**Q:** Is it ever correct to say “more better” or “more worse”?  
**A:** No. “Better” and “worse” are already comparative forms, so never add “more.” Just say “better” or “worse.” (e.g., NOT “more better,” NOT “more worse”).
