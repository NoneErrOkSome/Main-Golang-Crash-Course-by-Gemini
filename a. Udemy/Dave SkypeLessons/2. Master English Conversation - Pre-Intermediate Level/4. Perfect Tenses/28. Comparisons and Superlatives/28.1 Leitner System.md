**Flashcard 1**  
**Q:** What is the purpose of comparatives in English?  
**A:** Comparatives are used to compare two things (e.g., “bigger,” “newer,” “faster”).

---

**Flashcard 2**  
**Q:** What is the purpose of superlatives in English?  
**A:** Superlatives are used to show the highest degree or the “most” of something (e.g., “the biggest,” “the funniest”).

---

**Flashcard 3**  
**Q:** How do you form the comparative of a one-syllable adjective like “big”?  
**A:** Add “-er” (e.g., big → bigger). Sometimes you need to double the final consonant (e.g., hot → hotter).

---

**Flashcard 4**  
**Q:** How do you form the superlative of a one-syllable adjective like “big”?  
**A:** Add “-est” and always use “the” in front (e.g., the biggest).

---

**Flashcard 5**  
**Q:** How do you form comparatives and superlatives for two-syllable adjectives ending in “-y” (like “funny”)?  
**A:** Change “y” to “i” and add “-er” for comparatives and “-est” for superlatives (funny → funnier → the funniest).

---

**Flashcard 6**  
**Q:** Give an example of a two-syllable adjective ending in “y” turned into a comparative.  
**A:** Pretty → prettier.

---

**Flashcard 7**  
**Q:** How do you form comparatives for two-syllable adjectives that do NOT end in “-y” (e.g., “polite”)?  
**A:** Use “more” before the adjective (e.g., more polite).

---

**Flashcard 8**  
**Q:** How do you form superlatives for longer adjectives (generally two syllables or more, not ending in “-y”)?  
**A:** Use “the most” before the adjective (e.g., the most polite).

---

**Flashcard 9**  
**Q:** Which two very common adjectives are irregular in the comparative and superlative form?  
**A:** “Good” and “bad” do not follow normal rules.  
Good → better → the best  
Bad → worse → the worst

---

**Flashcard 10**  
**Q:** What word must follow a comparative when making a direct comparison?  
**A:** “Than” (e.g., bigger than, more expensive than).

---

**Flashcard 11**  
**Q:** How do you express that two things are equal using adjectives?  
**A:** Use “as + adjective + as” (e.g., “He is as tall as me.”).

---

**Flashcard 12**  
**Q:** How do you express inequality in terms of equality statements?  
**A:** Use “not as + adjective + as” (e.g., “London is not as cold as Moscow.”).

---

**Flashcard 13**  
**Q:** Why must you always use “the” before a superlative form?  
**A:** Superlatives describe an extreme that is singular and unique, so “the” is used to indicate it is one specific thing at the highest degree (e.g., the biggest, the most interesting).

---

**Flashcard 14**  
**Q:** Give an example contrasting a comparative and a superlative form of the same adjective.  
**A:** Big → bigger → the biggest.

---

**Flashcard 15**  
**Q:** How do you compare actions using the same pattern (e.g., drive, work)?  
**A:** For regular comparisons, use “more” or “-er” forms as appropriate, and include “than” (e.g., “She works harder than I do.”).

---

**Flashcard 16**  
**Q:** How do you form a question comparing two things using an adjective?  
**A:** Use inversion with “is” or “are” for adjectives only. For example: “Is Sweden more expensive than England?”

---

**Flashcard 17**  
**Q:** How do you form a question comparing two actions?  
**A:** Use “do/does” with the subject and then the comparative. For example: “Do women drive better than men?”

---

**Flashcard 18**  
**Q:** How do you indicate equal ability or manner when talking about verbs?  
**A:** Use “as + adverb + as,” e.g., “Women drive as well as men.”

---

**Flashcard 19**  
**Q:** For superlatives, when talking about personal experiences over your entire life, which tense should you often use and why?  
**A:** Present Perfect, because you are talking about an unfinished period (your whole life). E.g., “It’s the most delicious food I have ever eaten.”

---

**Flashcard 20**  
**Q:** Give an example question using a superlative and the present perfect.  
**A:** “What is the cheapest country you have ever been to?”
