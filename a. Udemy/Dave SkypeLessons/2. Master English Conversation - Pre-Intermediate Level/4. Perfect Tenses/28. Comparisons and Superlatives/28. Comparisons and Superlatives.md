Below is a rephrased explanation of the lesson, capturing the main ideas from the transcript but in my own words, and using examples mentioned there:

---

**Overview:**

English comparatives and superlatives help us compare things or show which one is at the highest or lowest degree of a quality. Comparatives typically compare two things, while superlatives highlight something as the “most” or “least” among many.

**Comparatives:**

1. **Short Adjectives (One Syllable)**  
    For adjectives with one syllable, you generally add “-er” to form the comparative. For example:
    
    - Big → Bigger (“This car is bigger than that one.”)
    - Tall → Taller (“He is taller than his brother.”)
    
    With some one-syllable words, you may need to double the final consonant before adding “-er.” For example:
    
    - Hot → Hotter
    
    Always remember to use “than” after the comparative form:
    
    - “Sweden is more expensive than England.”
    - “London is colder than Los Angeles.”
2. **Two-Syllable Adjectives Ending in ‘Y’**  
    For words like “funny” or “pretty,” change the “y” to “i” and then add “-er”:
    
    - Pretty → Prettier (“She is prettier than my sister.”)
    - Funny → Funnier (“British comedies are funnier than American ones, in my opinion.”)
3. **Longer Adjectives (Two Syllables or More, Not Ending in ‘Y’)**  
    If the adjective doesn’t end in ‘y’ and has two or more syllables, use “more” in front of it:
    
    - Polite → More polite (“He is more polite than his colleagues.”)
    - Generous → More generous (“Your friends are more generous than mine.”)
4. **Irregular Comparatives**  
    Common adjectives like “good” and “bad” don’t follow the rules:
    
    - Good → Better (“This phone is better than the old one.”)
    - Bad → Worse (“The weather today is worse than yesterday.”)
    
    Note: Don’t say “gooder” or “badder,” and never say “worser.”
    

**Superlatives:**

1. **Short Adjectives**  
    For one-syllable adjectives, add “-est” and always include “the”:
    
    - Big → The biggest (“He is the biggest in the class.”)
    - New → The newest (“This is the newest model available.”)
2. **Two-Syllable Adjectives Ending in ‘Y’**  
    Change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add “-est,” along with “the”:
    
    - Funny → The funniest (“This is the funniest show I’ve seen.”)
    - Pretty → The prettiest (“She is the prettiest girl in the world.”)
3. **Longer Adjectives**  
    Use “the most” before the adjective:
    
    - Polite → The most polite (“He is the most polite person I have ever met.”)
    - Dangerous → The most dangerous (“Sharks are some of the most dangerous creatures in the ocean.”)
    
    Remember to always use “the” before a superlative.
    
4. **Irregular Superlatives**
    
    - Good → The best (“This is the best coffee I have ever tasted.”)
    - Bad → The worst (“This is the worst day of my life.”)

**Expressing Equality:**

If you want to say two things are equal in some way, use “as + adjective + as”:

- “My twin brother is as tall as me.”
- “London is not as cold as Moscow.”

This structure shows that the qualities are equal or not equal.

- “Women drive as well as men” implies equal skill, while “Women do not drive as well as men” would imply inequality.

**Present Perfect with Superlatives:**

When talking about experiences throughout your life (an unfinished period), use the present perfect tense with superlatives:

- “He is the most generous person I have ever met.”
- “What is the cheapest country you have ever been to?”
- “This is the most delicious food I’ve eaten.”

These examples involve looking back at your entire life so far, so the present perfect (“have ever met,” “have ever been,” “have eaten”) fits naturally.

**In summary:**

- Add “-er”/“-est” for short adjectives.
- Use “more”/“most” for longer adjectives.
- Remember to use “than” in comparisons and “the” with superlatives.
- Know the few irregular forms by heart, like “good,” “bad,” and their comparative/superlative forms.
- Use “as … as” to talk about equality.
- In discussions about life experiences, pair superlatives with the present perfect.

Following these guidelines will make working with comparatives and superlatives in English much easier.
