The Present Perfect tense can feel tricky because it doesn’t exist in exactly the same way in many other languages. To understand it, first think about the Past Simple tense, which you probably know well. The Past Simple is straightforward: if something happened at a specific time in the past, and that moment is clearly finished, we use the Past Simple. For example:

- “I visited Paris in 2015.”
- “She ate dinner two hours ago.”
- “They left the party at midnight.”

These sentences all mention a time or at least have a clear sense of a completed event in the past.

The Present Perfect, on the other hand, focuses on the connection between the past and the present. We use it when we don’t specify exactly when something happened, or when we’re talking about a period of time that extends right up to now. Instead of highlighting a past moment, the Present Perfect emphasizes that something happened at some point before now and may still have an effect or relevance.

Here are some guiding principles:

1. **No Specific Time Mentioned:**  
    If you don’t say exactly when the action took place, and the time frame includes the present moment, use the Present Perfect. For example:
    
    - “I have visited Paris.” (I’m not telling you when; I’m just letting you know that this experience is part of my life up to today.)
    - “She has eaten dinner.” (This tells you that she’s already had dinner, but not at what time. Maybe you’re considering if she’s hungry now.)
2. **Unfinished Periods of Time:**  
    If you talk about something that started in the past and still continues, the Present Perfect is the right choice. This often goes with words like “for” and “since.”
    
    - “I have lived in this city for ten years.” (I moved here ten years ago, and I’m still here now. The ten-year period isn’t over, it continues up to the present.)
    - “He has worked at this company since 2020.” (He started in 2020 and still works there today.)
3. **Life Experiences (Without a Time Mention):**  
    If you’re describing your life as a whole (and you’re still alive), you can think of your entire life as an unfinished period.
    
    - “I have tried sushi.” (At some point in my life, I had the experience of trying sushi. I’m not saying when, just that it’s part of my life experience.)
    - “They have never watched that movie.” (Up to this point in their lives, they haven’t seen it.)
4. **How Many Times Up to Now:**  
    If you say how many times something has happened without tying it to a finished moment in the past, use the Present Perfect.
    
    - “I have seen that movie three times.” (All these three times happened before now, but I don’t give you any dates, and it’s still possible I might see it again.)

**Comparing the Two:**

- **Past Simple:** “I watched that movie last night.”  
    Here, “last night” sets a finished point in the past—yesterday is over—so Past Simple makes sense.
    
- **Present Perfect:** “I have watched that movie three times.”  
    I’m talking about my experience in general, up until this moment, without focusing on when I watched it. Maybe I watched it last month, maybe last year; the specific time doesn’t matter. What matters is the total experience so far.
    

Another comparison:

- **Past Simple:** “I moved to this apartment in 2018.”  
    That happened in a finished past year (2018), so we use the Past Simple.
    
- **Present Perfect:** “I have lived in this apartment since 2018.”  
    I’m talking about the entire period from 2018 until now. I’m still living here, so the time period continues. This is why the Present Perfect fits perfectly.

**In short:**

- Use the Past Simple when you know or say exactly when something happened and that time is over.
- Use the Present Perfect when the time is not mentioned or not important, when the action has a link to now, or when you’re describing an ongoing situation from the past up to the present.

The more you practice, the more natural it will feel. Think about whether you’re talking about a completed, dated past event (Past Simple), or a past action connected to your present experience (Present Perfect). Over time, you’ll get a feel for when the Present Perfect “just sounds right.”
