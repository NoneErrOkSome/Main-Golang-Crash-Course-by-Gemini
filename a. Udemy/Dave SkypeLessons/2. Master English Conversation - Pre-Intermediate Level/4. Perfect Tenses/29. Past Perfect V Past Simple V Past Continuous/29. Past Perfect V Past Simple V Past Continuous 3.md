The instructor mentions that we don’t use the Past Perfect as frequently as the Past Simple because most of the time, when we talk about past events, we naturally describe them in the order they happened. The Past Simple is perfect for this straightforward storytelling: “I woke up, I ate breakfast, I went to work.”

In other words, when we relate events in a simple, chronological manner, the Past Simple does the job. We say what happened first, then what happened second, and so on, without needing to refer back to an earlier time.

The Past Perfect, however, is only necessary when we need to jump back to an event that happened before our main past timeline. This situation arises less frequently than simply listing events in order. Most everyday stories and descriptions follow a simple past sequence, making Past Perfect structures less common in general conversation.
