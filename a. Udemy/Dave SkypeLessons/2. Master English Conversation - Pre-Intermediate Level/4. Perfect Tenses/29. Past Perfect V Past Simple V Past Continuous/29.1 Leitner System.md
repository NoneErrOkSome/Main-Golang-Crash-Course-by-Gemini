Below are flashcards derived from the key points of the previous explanation, suitable for a Leitner System. Each card focuses on a main idea or example from the text.

---

**Flashcard 1**  
**Q:** What are the three past tenses discussed, and what does each generally describe?  
**A:** Past Simple (completed actions in the past), Past Continuous (actions in progress at a past time), Past Perfect (actions that happened before another past action).

---

**Flashcard 2**  
**Q:** How do you form the Past Simple for regular and irregular verbs?  
**A:** For regular verbs, add “-ed” (e.g., “worked”). For irregular verbs, use their special past forms (e.g., “go” → “went”).

---

**Flashcard 3**  
**Q:** Give an example of a Past Simple sentence describing events in sequence.  
**A:** “I arrived at the party, took off my coat, sat on the sofa, and spoke to the host.”

---

**Flashcard 4**  
**Q:** When should you use the Past Continuous?  
**A:** Use the Past Continuous when an action was in progress at a specific past moment. For example: “When I arrived, everyone was dancing.”

---

**Flashcard 5**  
**Q:** How do you form the Past Continuous tense?  
**A:** Use “was” or “were” + the “-ing” form of the verb (e.g., “was singing,” “were eating”).

---

**Flashcard 6**  
**Q:** How do you form the Past Perfect tense?  
**A:** Use “had” + the past participle (third form) of the verb (e.g., “had eaten,” “had gone”).

---

**Flashcard 7**  
**Q:** When do you use the Past Perfect tense?  
**A:** Use it to describe an action that happened before another past action. For example: “When I arrived, everyone had already left.”

---

**Flashcard 8**  
**Q:** Compare Past Simple with Past Perfect using an example involving booking a table.  
**A:** “I didn’t get a table because I hadn’t booked in advance.” (Not booking happened first, then failing to get a table happened second.)

---

**Flashcard 9**  
**Q:** How do Past Simple and Past Continuous work together in a sentence?  
**A:** They show that one action interrupted another ongoing action. For example: “When I got home, they were still eating dinner.”

---

**Flashcard 10**  
**Q:** Give an example of using Past Perfect in reported speech.  
**A:** “He told me that he had finished his homework.” (He finished homework first, then he told me.)

---

**Flashcard 11**  
**Q:** Which common time-related words can appear with Past Perfect as well as Present Perfect?  
**A:** Words like “already,” “just,” “yet,” “since,” and “for” can be used, but now they refer to a time earlier than a past event.

---

**Flashcard 12**  
**Q:** Summarize the main use of each tense in one sentence.
