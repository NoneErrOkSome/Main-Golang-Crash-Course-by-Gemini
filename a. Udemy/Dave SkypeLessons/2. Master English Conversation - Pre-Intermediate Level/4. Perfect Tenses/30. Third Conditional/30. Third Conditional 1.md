Below is a rephrased explanation of the lesson, using the key points and examples from the transcript, but expressed in my own words. The goal is to provide a clear, connected overview of the third conditional, along with its relationship to the second conditional, while including the examples mentioned in the original text. No flashcard format, just a flowing explanation.

**Explaining the Third Conditional**

When we talk about unreal situations or regrets related to the past—things that did not actually happen but might have changed the outcome if they had—we use the third conditional. Compared to the second conditional, which focuses on unlikely or hypothetical situations in the present or future, the third conditional looks back on a moment in the past and imagines a different outcome if certain conditions had been met.

**Comparing Second and Third Conditionals:**

- **Second Conditional:** Used for unlikely or imaginary situations happening now or in the future. For instance, if you’re looking at a very expensive item in a store at this very moment, you might say:  
    _“If it were cheaper, I would buy it.”_  
    Here, you’re talking about the present moment—right now, the price is too high, so you’re not buying it.
    
- **Third Conditional:** Used for past situations that are over and can’t be changed. Imagine you’re talking to someone later about not having bought that same expensive item last week. The moment is gone, you’ve already made your decision. Now, to express how the outcome could have been different, you say:  
    _“If it had been cheaper, I would have bought it.”_  
    This points to a past event—last week’s shopping experience—that’s finished. The condition (the coat being cheaper) didn’t happen, so the result (you buying it) also didn’t happen.
    

**How to Form the Third Conditional:**

The third conditional structure is:  
**If + Past Perfect** → **Would Have + Past Participle**

- Past Perfect is formed using “had” + third form of the verb (e.g., “had been,” “had done,” “had seen,” “had opened”).
- The result clause uses “would have” followed by the past participle (e.g., “would have bought,” “would have taken,” “would have known”).

**Examples from the Lesson:**

1. Considering exams you took long ago:  
    _“If I had failed all my exams at university, I would have retaken them.”_  
    This means you passed your exams in reality, but you’re imagining a different past—one where you failed. Had that happened, you would have tried them again.
    
2. Thinking about this course you’re watching:  
    _“If you hadn’t made this course, I would have bought another one.”_  
    You’re showing that the existence of this course changed your choice. If, in the past, it hadn’t been created, you would have chosen a different course.
    
3. If a video lesson didn’t function correctly:  
    _“If this video lesson hadn’t worked, I would have contacted support.”_  
    Luckily, the lesson worked, but if it hadn’t, you know what you would have done.
    
4. Imagining a birthday scenario that’s now in the past:  
    _“If it had been my birthday yesterday and no one had given me a present, I would have burst into tears.”_  
    “Burst into tears” means to start crying suddenly. You’re picturing a disappointing birthday that, in reality, never happened.
    
5. Considering a job you currently have:  
    _“If I hadn’t found my current job, I would have gone back to university.”_  
    Again, this is looking back at a decision point in your life. You found your job, but if you hadn’t, you know how your life might have turned out differently.
    

**Checking Your Understanding with Exercises:**

The transcript suggests practicing by transforming sentences. For example, if someone hadn’t reminded you of a party last week, you would have forgotten it:

- _“If you hadn’t reminded me, I would have forgotten my cousin’s party.”_

Or, if you think about a past accident, consider seatbelts:

- _“They would have died in the accident if they hadn’t put on their seatbelts.”_

You can also apply it to sports situations that took place in the past:

- _“We would have won our last football match if you had scored the penalty.”_
- _“The referee wouldn’t have given you a red card if you hadn’t touched the ball.”_

These sentences all show events that are over and done with, and you’re just imagining a different set of circumstances leading to a different outcome.

**Distinguishing When to Use Third Conditional:**

- Use it only for past events that could have turned out differently if certain conditions had been met.
    
- If you’re talking about current or future hypotheticals, you use the second conditional: _“If I were rich, I would buy a huge house.”_ This sentence talks about now (or the near future), not a past event. Therefore, it’s a second conditional.
    
- If the question is about something that happened this morning and you’re imagining how you could have changed that outcome, you use the third conditional: _“I wouldn’t have been late for work this morning if I had taken a taxi.”_
    

**Why It’s Useful:**

The third conditional is not just random grammar. It helps you talk about regrets, missed opportunities, or just speculate about how things might have ended up differently. While the second conditional deals more often with fantasy or general hypotheticals, the third conditional is directly tied to real past moments that cannot be changed, giving you a way to express “what if…” about your history.
