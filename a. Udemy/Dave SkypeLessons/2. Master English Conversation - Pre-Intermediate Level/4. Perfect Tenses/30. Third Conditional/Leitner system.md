Below are detailed flashcards capturing the key concepts, explanations, and examples presented in the last three answers, particularly focusing on the second and third conditionals, their differences, and the illustrative examples provided. Each card includes either a question (Q) and answer (A) format or a statement with a focus on remembering important details.

---

**Flashcard 1**  
**Q:** What is the main difference between the second and third conditional in English?  
**A:** The second conditional deals with hypothetical or unlikely situations in the present or future, while the third conditional looks back on past situations that did not happen, imagining how different actions could have changed the outcome.

---

**Flashcard 2**  
**Q:** How is the second conditional generally formed?  
**A:** **If + Past Simple → Would + Base Verb**  
Example: “If it were cheaper, I would buy it.”  
This expresses a hypothetical scenario in the present or future.

---

**Flashcard 3**  
**Q:** How is the third conditional generally formed?  
**A:** **If + Past Perfect → Would Have + Past Participle**  
Example: “If it had been cheaper, I would have bought it.”  
This refers to an unreal past scenario—something that didn’t happen, but you’re imagining how it could have turned out differently if conditions had been met.

---

**Flashcard 4**  
**Concept Card:** Second Conditional Context  
**A:** The second conditional imagines unreal present or future situations. It’s often used for daydreams, advice, or improbable events.  
Example: “If you won £1 million, how would you spend it?”  
This implies winning the money is unlikely, but we’re speculating on what would happen if it occurred.

---

**Flashcard 5**  
**Concept Card:** Third Conditional Context  
**A:** The third conditional revisits a moment in the past that cannot be changed. It’s useful for expressing regrets, missed opportunities, or alternate outcomes in past events.  
Example: “If I had taken a taxi, I wouldn’t have been late for work this morning.”  
In reality, you did not take a taxi and you were late, but this structure imagines a different, impossible past.

---

**Flashcard 6**  
**Q:** Give an example of the second conditional applied to a current situation.  
**A:** “If I were rich, I would buy a huge house.”  
Here, being rich is not your current reality, but you’re imagining a present condition that isn’t true.

---

**Flashcard 7**  
**Q:** Give an example of the third conditional that expresses regret.  
**A:** “If you hadn’t left the map at home, we wouldn’t have got lost on holiday.”  
This rewinds a past event (forgetting the map) to show that the outcome (getting lost) could have been avoided.

---

**Flashcard 8**  
**Q:** Can you rearrange clauses in second and third conditionals?  
**A:** Yes. For both conditionals, the “if” clause can come first or second without changing the meaning.  
Examples:

- Second Conditional: “If it were cheaper, I would buy it.” / “I would buy it if it were cheaper.”
- Third Conditional: “If it had been cheaper, I would have bought it.” / “I would have bought it if it had been cheaper.”

---

**Flashcard 9**  
**Q:** Show how the second conditional gives advice in the present.  
**A:** “If I were in your shoes, I would resign.”  
This suggests a different current reality (being in another person’s position) and what you would do under those circumstances.

---

**Flashcard 10**  
**Q:** Provide a third conditional example involving a past academic outcome.  
**A:** “If I had failed all my exams at university, I would have retaken them.”  
This states a past hypothetical scenario (failing exams) and what would have happened afterward (retaking them), even though in reality you didn’t fail.

---

**Flashcard 11**  
**Q:** Give a third conditional example involving something that didn’t happen with this course.  
**A:** “If you hadn’t made this course, I would have bought another one.”  
It indicates that the existence of this course changed a decision in the past.

---

**Flashcard 12**  
**Concept Card:** Time Frames of Conditionals  
**A:**

- Second Conditional → Unlikely situations now or in the future.
- Third Conditional → Unreal situations in the past, reflecting on events that can’t be changed.

---

**Flashcard 13**  
**Q:** How does the third conditional help express the idea of “what might have been”?  
**A:** It allows you to rewrite past history. For instance:  
“If it had been my birthday yesterday and no one had given me a present, I would have burst into tears.”  
This scenario never happened, but you’re expressing how you would have felt and reacted if it had.

---

**Flashcard 14**  
**Concept Card:** Using Vivid Expressions with Third Conditional  
**A:** The third conditional can be combined with natural English phrases to sound more fluent. For example:

- “I would have burst into tears” means “I would have started crying a lot.”
- “I would have contacted support” shows a logical reaction to a problem that occurred in the past scenario.

---

**Flashcard 15**  
**Q:** Why is the third conditional considered more “useful” for reflecting on real life compared to the second conditional?  
**A:** Because it’s often tied to real past events that actually happened, letting you express regrets or alternative outcomes about things you could have done differently. The second conditional is more hypothetical and less tied to actual past events.
