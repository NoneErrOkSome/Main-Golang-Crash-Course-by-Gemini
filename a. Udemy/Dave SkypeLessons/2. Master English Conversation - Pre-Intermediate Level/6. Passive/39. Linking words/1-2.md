### Part 1/10: Introduction to Linking Words

Welcome to the class on linking words. These words are essential in writing and speaking because they help join parts of sentences or clauses together.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Linking Words**:
    
    - They join **sentences** or **clauses**.
    - A **clause** is any part of a sentence containing a **subject** and a **verb**.
2. **Types of Linking Words**:
    
    - **Conjunctions**: These join **clauses** together.
    - **Adverbs**: These link **main clauses**, but the punctuation rules are different.
    - **Prepositions**: These are followed by a **noun** and sometimes modified to act like conjunctions when paired with phrases like _the fact that_.

#### Structure of the Lesson:

- The lesson focuses on **cause and effect** linking words, broken into **four types**.
- Examples will show **why an action occurred**.

---

**Example from the Whiteboard**:

- _The weather was gorgeous, so we went for a picnic._
- This sentence demonstrates cause and effect: the reason (_gorgeous weather_) explains the action (_going for a picnic_).

---

#### Understanding "So" (FANBOYS):

- "So" is a **coordinating conjunction** (one of the FANBOYS: _for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so_).
- FANBOYS join **equal elements**, such as two independent clauses.
- Example:
    - _The weather was gorgeous, so we went for a picnic._
        - Here, _so_ gives the reason and joins two complete ideas (clauses).
        - Rule: Place a **comma** before "so".

#### FANBOYS Usage in Spoken English:

- Commonly used in **everyday speech**: _so, and, but, or_.
- Less common in speech but found in **literature**: _for, nor, yet_.

#### Additional Example (from transcript):

- _I took off my jumper, for I was hot._
    - Here, "for" acts as a coordinating conjunction, meaning _because_.

### Part 2/10: Subordinating Conjunctions for Cause and Effect

#### Subordinating Conjunctions

- Words like **since**, **because**, and **as** are subordinating conjunctions.
- They **join a dependent clause** (subordinate clause) to an **independent clause** (main clause).
- Example from the whiteboard:
    - _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
    - _Because the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
    - _As the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._

---

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Clause Order**:
    
    - Subordinate clauses can come **before** or **after** the main clause:
        - _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
        - _We went for a picnic since the weather was gorgeous._
    - The meaning remains the same in both cases.
2. **Punctuation**:
    
    - If the subordinate clause comes **first**, use a **comma**:
        - _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
    - No comma is needed if the subordinate clause comes **after**:
        - _We went for a picnic since the weather was gorgeous._

---

#### The Two Meanings of "Since":

1. **Time Reference**:
    
    - When "since" refers to a specific moment in time, it’s often used with the **present perfect tense**:
        - _I haven’t seen him since I was 11 years old._
        - _I haven’t seen him since 1994._
        - This usage establishes a time frame starting in the past and continuing to the present.
2. **Cause and Effect**:
    
    - When "since" means **because**, it explains the reason for an action:
        - _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._

---

#### Important Notes:

- Unlike FANBOYS, subordinating conjunctions can join **unequal elements** (main clause + subordinate clause).
- These conjunctions **must be followed by a clause** (a subject and a verb). For example:
    - ✅ _Since the weather was gorgeous_ (correct: clause included).
    - ❌ _Since the weather_ (incorrect: lacks a verb).

---

#### Whiteboard Examples Recap:

1. _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
2. _We went for a picnic since the weather was gorgeous._

**Synonyms**:

- _Because_, _as_, and _since_ are interchangeable in this context. They all mean the same thing:
    - _Because the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
    - _As the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
