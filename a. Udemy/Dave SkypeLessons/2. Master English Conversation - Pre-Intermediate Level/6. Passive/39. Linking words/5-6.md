    - Structure: **Main clause, FANBOYS, main clause.**
    - Example:
        - _It was pouring with rain, but we went for a picnic._

#### Key Points about FANBOYS:

1. **Joins Main Clauses**:
    
    - Each clause must be a complete thought with a subject and a verb.
        - _It was pouring with rain_ (main clause).
        - _We went for a picnic_ (main clause).
2. **Common in Everyday Speech**:

#### Subordinating Conjunctions for Contrast and Concession

- Words like **although**, **though**, and **even though** express **concession** (unexpected results).
    - Example:
        - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._

#### Key Characteristics of Subordinating Conjunctions:

1. **Clause Placement**:
    
    - Subordinate clauses can come **before** or **after** the main clause:
        - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._
        - _We went for a picnic, although it was pouring with rain._
2. **Punctuation Rules**:
    
    - If the subordinate clause comes first, use a **comma**:
        - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._
    - No comma is needed if it comes second:
        - _We went for a picnic although it was pouring with rain._
3. **Clause Requirement**:
    
    - Subordinating conjunctions must be followed by a **complete clause** (subject + verb).
        - _Although it was pouring with rain_ (correct).
        - _Although the rain_ (incorrect: missing a verb).

        - _Whereas I’m a meat-eater, my wife is a vegetarian._
2. **Concession** introduces a **surprising or unexpected result**.
    
    - Example:
        - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._

---

#### Key Characteristics of "While" and "Whereas":

        - _While I’m a meat-eater, my wife is a vegetarian._
        - _Whereas I’m a meat-eater, my wife is a vegetarian._
3. **Clause Placement**:
    
    - The subordinate clause can come before or after the main clause:
        - _While I’m a meat-eater, my wife is a vegetarian._
        - _My wife is a vegetarian, while I’m a meat-eater._
4. **Punctuation**:
    
    - When the subordinate clause comes first, use a **comma**:
        - _While I’m a meat-eater, my wife is a vegetarian._
    - No comma is needed if it comes second:
        - _My wife is a vegetarian while I’m a meat-eater._

#### Differences Between Contrast and Concession:

1. **Contrast**:
    
    - Highlights opposing or different elements without introducing surprise.
    - Example:
        - _While he earns $50,000, I only get $20,000._
        - _Whereas he earns $50,000, I only get $20,000._
2. **Concession**:
    
    - Includes an element of **surprise** or an unexpected outcome.
    - Example:
        - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._

---

#### The Dual Meaning of "While":

1. **Contrast**:
    
    - Used to compare two opposing ideas.
        - _While he earns $50,000, I only get $20,000._
        - _While I’m tall, my brother is short._
2. **Simultaneous Actions**:
    
    - Describes two actions happening at the same time, often using the **past continuous tense**:
        - _While I was walking home, I saw an accident._
        - _While I was cooking, the phone rang._

---

#### Important Notes:

- **While** and **whereas** are not interchangeable with **although** or **even though** when expressing concession.
    
    - Example:
        - _While it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._ (Incorrect for concession).
        - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._ (Correct for concession).
- **Formal vs. Informal**:
    
    - These conjunctions are slightly more formal, making them ideal for academic writing or structured comparisons.
