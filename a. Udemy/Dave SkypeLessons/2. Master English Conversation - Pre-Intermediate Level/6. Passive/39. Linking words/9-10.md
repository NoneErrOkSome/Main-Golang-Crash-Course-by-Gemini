### Part 9/10: Comparing Types of Linking Words

#### Organizing Linking Words into Groups

- To effectively use linking words, it is helpful to categorize them into **four main groups**:
    1. **Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)**
    2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**
    3. **Conjunctive Adverbs**
    4. **Prepositions**

---

### 1. **Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)**

- **For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So**
- Characteristics:
    - Join **two equal elements** (main clauses).
    - Use a **comma** before the conjunction.
- Example:
    - _It was pouring with rain, but we went for a picnic._

---

### 2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**

- Examples: **Although, Though, Even though, Since, Because, As, While, Whereas**
- Characteristics:
    - Join a **subordinate clause** to a **main clause**.
    - Subordinate clauses can appear **before** or **after** the main clause.
    - If the subordinate clause comes first, a **comma** is required.
- Examples:
    - _Although it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._
    - _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
    - _While I’m a meat-eater, my wife is a vegetarian._

### 3. **Conjunctive Adverbs**

- Examples: **Therefore, Consequently, As a result, However, Nevertheless, Nonetheless**
- Characteristics:
    - Link **two independent clauses**.
    - Use a **semicolon (;)** before the adverb and a **comma (,)** after it.
    - Common in formal and academic writing.
- Examples:
    - _It was pouring with rain; however, we went for a picnic._
    - _The weather was gorgeous; therefore, we went for a picnic._

### 4. **Prepositions**

- Examples: **In spite of, Despite, Thanks to, Owing to, Because of, Due to**
- Characteristics:
    - Followed by a **noun**, **noun phrase**, or **gerund**.
    - Can be modified to include a clause by adding _the fact that_.
- Examples:
    - _In spite of the awful weather, we went for a picnic._
    - _Despite the fact that it was pouring with rain, we went for a picnic._
    - _Thanks to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._

#### Advanced Insights

1. **Dual Meanings of Linking Words**:
    
    - Certain linking words have multiple meanings, which can make them tricky to use correctly.
    - Examples:
        - **Since**:
            - Time: _I haven’t seen him since 1994._
            - Cause/Effect: _Since the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
        - **While**:
            - Simultaneous actions: _While I was walking, it started raining._

            - Time: _As I was leaving, the phone rang._
            - Cause/Effect: _As the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
2. **Synonyms Across Categories**:
    
    - Many linking words can express similar ideas but belong to different categories:
        - Example: _Because_, _Since_, _Due to_ all express cause and effect but require different structures (e.g., conjunction vs. preposition).
3. **Formal vs. Informal Contexts**:
    
    - Choose linking words that match the tone of your writing:
        - Informal: _So_, _But_
        - Formal: _Therefore_, _Nevertheless_, _Despite_

        - _The weather was gorgeous, so we went for a picnic._ (FANBOYS)
        - _The weather was gorgeous; therefore, we went for a picnic._ (Conjunctive adverb)
3. **Avoiding Repetition**:
