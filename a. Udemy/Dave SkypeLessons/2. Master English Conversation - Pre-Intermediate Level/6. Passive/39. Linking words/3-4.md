### Part 3/10: Conjunctive Adverbs for Cause and Effect

#### What Are Conjunctive Adverbs?

- Conjunctive adverbs include words like **therefore**, **consequently**, and **as a result**.
- They link **two main clauses**, similar to coordinating conjunctions like "so," but with **different punctuation rules**.
- Example from the whiteboard:
    - _The weather was gorgeous; therefore, we went for a picnic._

---

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Punctuation Rules**:
    
    - Use a **semicolon (;)** before the conjunctive adverb and a **comma (,)** after it.
        - Example: _The weather was gorgeous; therefore, we went for a picnic._
    - This punctuation demonstrates advanced understanding of sentence structure, particularly in formal writing like essays.
2. **Usage Context**:
    
    - Conjunctive adverbs sound **formal** and are excellent choices for essays or academic writing.
    - They show a **logical relationship** between two main clauses (cause and effect).
3. **Clause Independence**:
    
    - Both clauses connected by a conjunctive adverb are **main clauses** (complete thoughts).
    - Example:
        - Main clause 1: _The weather was gorgeous._
        - Conjunctive adverb: _therefore,_
        - Main clause 2: _we went for a picnic._

---

#### Example Sentences from the Whiteboard:

1. _The weather was gorgeous; therefore, we went for a picnic._
2. _The weather was gorgeous; consequently, we went for a picnic._
3. _The weather was gorgeous; as a result, we went for a picnic._

---

#### Synonymity and Consistency:

- Conjunctive adverbs like **therefore**, **consequently**, and **as a result** are synonyms in this context. They all express a cause-and-effect relationship:
    - _The weather was gorgeous; therefore, we went for a picnic._
    - _The weather was gorgeous; as a result, we went for a picnic._
    - _The weather was gorgeous; consequently, we went for a picnic._

---

#### Advanced Notes:

1. **Semicolon Mastery**:
    
    - Using a semicolon to link ideas in this way demonstrates high-level writing skills.
    - Conjunctive adverbs act as a transition, bridging the two main clauses with clarity and logic.
2. **Formal Writing**:
    
    - Conjunctive adverbs are **less common** in everyday spoken English but are highly valued in formal contexts, such as essays and reports.

### Part 4/10: Prepositions for Cause and Effect

#### What Are Prepositions in This Context?

- Prepositions, such as **thanks to**, **owing to**, **because of**, and **due to**, are used to show a cause-and-effect relationship.
- Unlike conjunctions or conjunctive adverbs, prepositions are always followed by a **noun**, a **noun phrase**, or, in some cases, a gerund (**-ing** form).

---

#### Structure of Prepositions:

1. **Preposition + Noun/Noun Phrase**:
    
    - Example: _Thanks to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
        - Here, _thanks to_ is followed by the noun phrase _the gorgeous weather_.
2. **Preposition + the fact that + Clause**:
    
    - Example: _Due to the fact that the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
        - This structure turns the preposition into something closer to a conjunction by adding _the fact that_ and a complete clause (_the weather was gorgeous_).
3. **Preposition + Gerund (-ing form)**:
    
    - Example: _Thanks to having a map, we didn’t get lost._

---

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **No Clauses Without Modifications**:
    
    - Prepositions cannot be followed directly by a clause (subject + verb) unless modified by _the fact that_.
        - Correct: _Thanks to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
        - Incorrect: _Thanks to the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
2. **Flexible Placement**:
    
    - The prepositional phrase can appear at the start or the end of a sentence:
        - _Thanks to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
        - _We went for a picnic thanks to the gorgeous weather._

---

#### Examples from the Whiteboard:

1. _Thanks to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
    
2. _Owing to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
    
3. _Because of the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
    
4. _Due to the gorgeous weather, we went for a picnic._
    
5. With _the fact that_:
    
    - _Due to the fact that the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
    - _Thanks to the fact that the weather was gorgeous, we went for a picnic._
6. With gerunds:
    
    - _Thanks to having a map, we didn’t get lost._
    - _Despite leaving early, we arrived late._

---

#### Why Use Prepositions?

1. **Variety in Sentence Structure**:
    
    - Prepositions provide flexibility in sentence formation, allowing writers to introduce cause-and-effect relationships without always relying on conjunctions.
2. **Conciseness**:
    
    - Using a simple prepositional phrase (_thanks to the gorgeous weather_) can be more concise than a full clause (_because the weather was gorgeous_).
3. **Formal and Informal Usage**:
    
    - Prepositions like _thanks to_ are common in both formal and informal writing.

---

#### Advanced Notes:

- **Preference for Simplicity**:
    
    - While structures like _due to the fact that_ are grammatically correct, they can sound unnecessarily wordy. Many writers prefer simpler phrases like _because of_ or _thanks to_.
- **Gerund Usage**:
    
    - Although gerunds are less common after these prepositions, they are grammatically correct and add variety:
        - _Thanks to growing up in Toronto, I speak French fluently._
        - _Despite being overweight, he’s a very fast runner._
