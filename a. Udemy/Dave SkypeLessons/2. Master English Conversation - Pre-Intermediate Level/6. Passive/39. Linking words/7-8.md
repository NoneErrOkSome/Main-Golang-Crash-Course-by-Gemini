### Part 7/10: Conjunctive Adverbs for Contrast and Concession

#### What Are Conjunctive Adverbs?

- Conjunctive adverbs such as **however**, **nevertheless**, and **nonetheless** are used to express **contrast** or **concession** between two main clauses.
- These adverbs add formality and sophistication to writing and require specific punctuation.

---

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Punctuation**:
    
    - Use a **semicolon (;)** before the conjunctive adverb and a **comma (,)** after it:
        - Example: _It was pouring with rain; nevertheless, we went for a picnic._
    - The semicolon separates the two **main clauses**, and the adverb transitions between them.
2. **Formal Writing**:
    
    - Conjunctive adverbs are common in **academic** and **formal** writing but less common in casual speech.
3. **Independent Clauses**:
    
    - Each clause connected by a conjunctive adverb must be a complete thought:
        - _Main clause 1: It was pouring with rain._
        - _Conjunctive adverb: nevertheless,_
        - _Main clause 2: we went for a picnic._

2. **Usage in Comparisons**:
    
    - _I’m a meat-eater; however, my wife is a vegetarian._
    - _My daughter plays the piano; however, my son plays the drums._

---

#### Distinction Between Contrast and Concession:

1. **Contrast** (focuses on opposing ideas):
    
    - Example: _I’m a meat-eater; however, my wife is a vegetarian._
    - Example: _He earns $50,000; however, I only get $20,000._
2. **Concession** (introduces an unexpected result):
    
    - Example: _It was pouring with rain; nevertheless, we went for a picnic._

#### Advanced Notes:

1. **However for Contrast**:
    
    - _However_ is often used for pure contrast between two opposing ideas:
        - _I’m a meat-eater; however, my wife is a vegetarian._
2. **Nevertheless and Nonetheless for Concession**:
    
    - These adverbs are typically used to introduce an **unexpected result**:
        - _It was pouring with rain; nevertheless, we went for a picnic._
        - _It was pouring with rain; nonetheless, we went for a picnic._
3. **Formal Use in Essays**:
    
    - These adverbs demonstrate higher-level writing skills in formal contexts:
        - _The findings were inconclusive; however, the research provided valuable insights._

---

#### Important Reminder:

- Conjunctive adverbs differ from **FANBOYS** conjunctions because of the punctuation:
    - FANBOYS: _It was raining, but we went for a picnic._ (Comma)
    - Conjunctive Adverbs: _It was raining; nevertheless, we went for a picnic._ (Semicolon + comma)

        - _Despite the awful weather_ (noun phrase).
2. **The Fact That + Clause**:

        - _We went for a picnic in spite of the awful weather._
2. **Formal vs. Informal Usage**:
    
    - Both _in spite of_ and _despite_ are used in formal and informal contexts.
    - _Despite_ is slightly more concise and commonly preferred in academic writing.
3. **Common Mistakes**:
    
    - Never use _in spite of_ or _despite_ directly with a clause (without _the fact that_):
        - Incorrect: _Despite it was raining, we went for a picnic._
        - Correct: _Despite the fact that it was raining, we went for a picnic._
