**Key Lesson Points (Passive with Gerunds and Infinitives):**

- **Gerund Passive Form:**
    
    - Form: **being + past participle**  
        When you want to use a passive construction in a place where a gerund (-ing form) would normally appear, you use "being" followed by the past participle:  
        Example:
    - **Active (with gerund):** I don’t like **kissing** men with moustaches.
    - **Passive (with gerund):** I don’t like **being kissed** by men with moustaches.  
        (Here, “being kissed” is the passive gerund form, focusing on the experience rather than who is performing the action.)
- **Infinitive Passive Form:**
    
    - Form: **to be + past participle**  
        If you need an infinitive form in the passive, you use “to be” plus the past participle:  
        Example:
    - **Active (with infinitive):** I don’t like **to kiss** men with moustaches.
    - **Passive (with infinitive):** I don’t like **to be kissed** by men with moustaches.
- **Usage of Passive Gerunds and Infinitives:**  
    These forms are often used when you want to emphasize the state or experience from the point of view of the subject rather than the agent. For instance, after verbs like "like," "hate," "love," or “want,” you can choose a gerund or infinitive passive form if you want to avoid mentioning who performs the action.
