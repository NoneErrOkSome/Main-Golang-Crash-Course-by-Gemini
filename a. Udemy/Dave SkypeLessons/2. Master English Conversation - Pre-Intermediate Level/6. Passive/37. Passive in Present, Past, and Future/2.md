**Key Lesson Points (Past Simple Passive):**

- **Past Simple Passive Structure:**
    
    - Form: **was/were + past participle (third form)**  
        Use **was** for singular subjects and **were** for plural subjects.  
        Examples:
    - **Active:** I built this shed with my brother.  
        **Passive:** This shed **was built** three years ago (…by my brother and me).
    - **Active:** Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492.  
        **Passive:** America **was discovered** in 1492 (…by Christopher Columbus).
    - **Active:** Last night the police stopped us.  
        **Passive:** Last night we **were stopped** (…by the police).
- **Use of 'By' with the Past Simple Passive:**  
    Just like in present simple passive, you can add “by” if you want to specify the agent:
    
    - These books **were written by Tolstoy**.  
        If it’s not important who did it, or if it’s unknown, you can simply omit the agent:
    - These books **were written** (no need to say by who).
- **Irregular Verbs:**  
    Past participles of irregular verbs must be learned:
    
    - write → wrote → **written**
    - discover → discovered → **discovered** (regular)
    - steal → stole → **stolen**  
        Learning these forms is crucial for correct passive usage.
