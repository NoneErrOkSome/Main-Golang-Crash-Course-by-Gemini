Active and passive voice are two different ways of expressing the same idea, but they highlight different elements of a sentence. To understand them thoroughly, we need to examine how they are formed, why they are used, and what effects they have on style, clarity, and emphasis.

**1. Definition of Active vs. Passive Voice**

- **Active Voice:** In an active sentence, the subject of the sentence is the “doer”—the one performing the action. The sentence structure typically follows a logical pattern: Subject → Verb → Object. For example, “The chef prepares the meal.” Here, “the chef” (subject) is doing the action “prepares” to “the meal” (object).
- **Passive Voice:** In a passive sentence, the focus shifts to the recipient or the result of the action rather than the doer. The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence, and the subject (the doer) can be omitted or moved to a phrase starting with “by.” The sentence structure often becomes: Subject (originally the object) → Form of “be” → Past Participle → (by + agent, if mentioned). For example, “The meal is prepared (by the chef).” Now, “the meal” is the subject, and the emphasis is on the meal being prepared, rather than on who prepares it.

**2. How to Form the Passive Voice**

- **Basic Formula:** Subject (original object) + appropriate form of “be” + past participle of the main verb (+ by + original subject if needed).
- **Choice of “Be”:** The form of “be” (am/is/are, was/were, have been/has been, will be, etc.) depends on the tense you want to express. For example:
    - Present Simple: “am/is/are” + past participle → “The car is washed.”
    - Past Simple: “was/were” + past participle → “The car was washed.”
    - Present Continuous: “am/is/are being” + past participle → “The car is being washed.”
    - Past Continuous: “was/were being” + past participle → “The car was being washed.”
    - Present Perfect: “have/has been” + past participle → “The car has been washed.”
    - Future with “will”: “will be” + past participle → “The car will be washed.”
- **Irregular Verbs:** The past participle of irregular verbs must be memorized. For example:
    - Eat → ate → eaten
    - Write → wrote → written
    - Break → broke → broken  
        Since the passive always requires the past participle, knowing these forms is crucial.

**3. When and Why We Use the Passive Voice**

- **Unknown Agent:** If we don’t know who performed the action, the passive is handy. For example, “My wallet was stolen” indicates that someone took your wallet, but you don’t know who.
- **Unimportant or Obvious Agent:** If the identity of the doer is irrelevant or obvious, we can focus on the event. For instance, in a newspaper report: “Two people were arrested yesterday.” It’s not always essential to say who did the arresting, especially if it’s understood that the police performed that action.
- **Formal or Impersonal Tone:** Academic and scientific writing often favors passive constructions to focus on processes or results rather than on the researcher or writer. For example, “The data were analyzed using standard methods” sounds more formal and objective than “We analyzed the data using standard methods.”
- **Emphasis on the Object:** Sometimes we want to highlight what happened rather than who did it. For example, “A new vaccine was developed last year” puts the spotlight on the vaccine, emphasizing the innovation rather than the team behind it.

**4. When to Use Active Voice**

- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Active voice usually leads to shorter, clearer sentences. For example, “The manager organized a meeting” is more direct than “A meeting was organized by the manager.”
- **Emphasizing the Doer:** If it’s important for your reader to know who is responsible for the action, the active voice is better. For instance, in instructions or policy statements: “The supervisor will give you the instructions” clearly states who does what.
- **More Engaging Style:** Active sentences often feel more dynamic, energetic, and engaging, making them suitable for most types of writing, especially creative writing, blogs, or persuasive essays.

**5. Agent in the Passive Voice: ‘By + Noun’**

- If you choose to include the doer in a passive sentence, you add them at the end with “by.” For example: “The meeting was organized by the manager.” However, once you name the doer, you must consider why you are using the passive at all—if it’s essential to name the doer, maybe the active voice would be more straightforward. Passive can still be useful when emphasizing the result or maintaining a certain tone.

**6. Passive in Different Structures**

- **Modal Verbs:** When you have a modal verb (like can, should, will, must), the passive form is modal + be + past participle: “Your homework should be done,” “The problem can be solved,” “The proposal will be considered.”
- **Continuous Forms:** For continuous tenses, insert “being” before the past participle: “is being done,” “were being investigated.”
- **Perfect Tenses:** For perfect tenses, use “been”: “has been completed,” “had been prepared.”

**7. Passive Forms of Infinitives and Gerunds**

- **Infinitive Passive:** “to be” + past participle. For example, “I want to be informed,” or “The documents need to be signed.”
- **Gerund Passive:** “being” + past participle. For example, “I don’t like being told what to do,” where the focus is on the state of receiving the action.

**8. Style Considerations and Balance**

- **Overuse of Passive:** Constantly using passive voice can make writing feel vague, lifeless, or unnecessarily wordy. Passive is not inherently “wrong,” but it should be a deliberate choice. Use it to achieve specific stylistic or communicative goals.
- **Finding a Balance:** Good writing often involves a blend of active and passive constructions. Choose passive when you need to de-emphasize the agent or highlight the action or result. Use active when you want directness and clarity.

**9. Context-Dependent Choice**

- The choice between active and passive often depends on context. In everyday speech, we commonly use active forms (“I cleaned the house,” “They found the keys”). In scientific reports, passive is common (“The samples were tested,” “Results were obtained”). In business writing, you might mix both to ensure the focus is on information while still maintaining a human, responsible tone when needed.

---

**In summary:**

- **Active voice** focuses on the doer (Subject-Verb-Object), is direct, clear, and generally shorter.
- **Passive voice** focuses on the action or what’s affected by it (Object becomes Subject), and is formed with a form of “be” plus a past participle. It’s useful when the doer is unknown, unimportant, obvious, or when a certain level of formality or objectivity is desired.

Mastering both active and passive voice allows for stylistic flexibility. Knowing when and how to use them gives your writing greater precision, control over tone, and clarity of emphasis.
