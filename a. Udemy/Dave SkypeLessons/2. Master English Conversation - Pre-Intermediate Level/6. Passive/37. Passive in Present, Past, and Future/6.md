**6/6**  
**Summary and Final Notes:**

- **Passive in Various Tenses:**  
    You can form the passive in almost any tense using the appropriate form of the verb **to be** (am/is/are, was/were, have been/has been, will be, etc.) plus the **past participle** of the main verb.  
    Examples:
    
    - Present Simple: **is made**, **are organized**
    - Past Simple: **was built**, **were written**
    - Present Continuous: **is being followed**, **are being taught**
    - Past Continuous: **was being repaired**, **were being painted**
    - Present Perfect: **has been told**, **have been sacked**
    - Modals: **will be checked**, **should be returned**, **can be found**
    - Gerunds & Infinitives: **being kissed**, **to be kissed**
- **Why Use the Passive?**  
    Use the passive when:
    
    1. The agent (person doing the action) is unknown, unimportant, or obvious.
    2. You want to focus on the action or the object being acted upon rather than on the subject performing the action.
    3. You wish to sound more formal or impersonal, often in academic or official contexts.
- **Remembering Irregular Past Participles:**  
    Knowing the third forms of irregular verbs is essential for forming the passive correctly:
    
    - write → wrote → **written**
    - steal → stole → **stolen**
    - speak → spoke → **spoken**
    - make → made → **made**  
        These must be memorized over time for fluent passive usage.
- **Including the Agent with ‘By’:**  
    If you need to mention who did the action, add “by + agent”:
    
    - “America was discovered **by Christopher Columbus**.”
    - “The meetings are organized **by our manager**.”
    - “The shed was built **by my brother and me**.”
- **Ask Questions for Clarification:**  
    If something is not clear, asking questions will help deepen understanding. The instructor encourages learners to seek clarification so difficulties can be addressed directly.
