**Key Lesson Points (Introduction to the Passive and Present Simple Passive):**

- **Definition of Passive:** The passive voice is used when we want to focus on the action or the object affected by the action rather than the person (or thing) doing the action. In other words, the object of an active sentence can become the subject in a passive sentence, and the "doer" of the action (the agent) can be left out if not important or unknown.
    
- **Present Simple Passive Structure:**
    
    - Form: **am/is/are + past participle (third form)**  
        Examples:
        - **Active:** I play football every Saturday.  
            **Passive:** Football **is played** every Saturday.
        - **Active:** I make coffee in the kitchen.  
            **Passive:** Coffee **is made** in the kitchen.
        - **Active:** Our manager organizes weekly meetings.  
            **Passive:** Weekly meetings **are organized**.
- **When to Use Present Simple Passive:**  
    Use the present simple passive when talking about habitual or regular actions, especially when the performer of the action is either not important, not known, or not mentioned. For example:
    
    - **The grass is cut every month.**  
        Here, who cuts the grass is not important, so we focus on the action and the grass.
- **Agent in Passive:**  
    If you need to mention who does the action, you can add "by" + agent at the end:
    
    - Weekly meetings are organized **by the manager**.
    - The grass is cut every month **by her**.  
        "By" introduces the person or thing that performs the action in a passive sentence.
- **Importance of the Third Form (Past Participle):**  
    In passive forms, it’s essential to know the third form of verbs (past participles), especially for irregular verbs:
    
    - break → broke → **broken**
    - speak → spoke → **spoken**
    - write → wrote → **written**
    - make → made → **made**  
        Regular verbs typically add “-ed” for both past simple and past participle:
    - play → played → **played**
