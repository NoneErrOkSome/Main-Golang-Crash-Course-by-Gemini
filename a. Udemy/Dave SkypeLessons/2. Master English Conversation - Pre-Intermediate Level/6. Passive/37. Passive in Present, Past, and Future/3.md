**Key Lesson Points (Present Continuous and Past Continuous Passive):**

- **Present Continuous Passive Structure:**
    
    - Form: **am/is/are + being + past participle**  
        Present continuous suggests something happening right now, “in the middle of” the action.  
        Examples:
    - **Active:** That suspicious man **is following** us.  
        **Passive:** We **are being followed** (…by that suspicious man).
    - **Active:** Dave **is teaching** us passive.  
        **Passive:** We **are being taught** passive (…by Dave).
- **Past Continuous Passive Structure:**
    
    - Form: **was/were + being + past participle**  
        Past continuous indicates that the action was happening at a specific time in the past, “in the middle of” something.  
        Examples:
    - **Active:** They **were repairing** the road.  
        **Passive:** The road **was being repaired** (…by them).
    - **Active:** We **were painting** the house.  
        **Passive:** The house **was being painted** (…by us).
- **Usage Notes:**  
    Present continuous and past continuous passives are less common than present simple or past simple passives. They appear when you need to emphasize an action in progress at the moment or at a specific time in the past without mentioning the doer.
