##### **Using "Say" vs. "Tell" Recap**

1. **Say and Tell**: Common Mistakes and Corrections
    - The instructor emphasizes some common mistakes:
        - **Incorrect**: _"Dave said me that..."_
            - **Correct**: _"Dave said that..."_
            - When using "say," it should not include a direct object (a person being spoken to).
        - **Incorrect**: _"Dave told that..."_
            - **Correct**: _"Dave told me that..."_
            - "Tell" requires a recipient—someone who is being told.

            - _"Dave said that strawberries grow in his garden."_
        - Use **"tell"** when specifying **to whom** the information is directed:
            - _"Dave told us that strawberries grow in his garden."_

        - Used to indicate ability or knowledge of a language.

        - **Examples**:
            - _"We talked about the weather."_
            - _"The teacher talked to us about the homework."_

                - _"The teacher spoke about the homework."_
    - **Talk to somebody about something**:
        - Very similar to "speak," but it is less formal and used for casual conversations.
