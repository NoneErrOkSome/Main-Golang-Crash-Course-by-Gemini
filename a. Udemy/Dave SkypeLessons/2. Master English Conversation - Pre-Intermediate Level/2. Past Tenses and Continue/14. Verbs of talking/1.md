#### **Key Verbs of Talking**

1. **Say**
    
    - **General Usage**:
        - Use "say" when quoting or reporting someone's words. Especially useful for **short phrases** or **one-word statements**.
        - Common uses: saying hello, yes, no, or thanks.
        - **Example**: "He said hello." / "He said yes."
    - **Grammar Points**:
        - In Present Simple, add **-s** when the subject is **he, she, it**: _"Dave says hello every lesson."_
        - In the Past Simple, **"say"** changes to **"said"** because it is an **irregular verb**.
        - **Example**: "Dave said hello yesterday."
    - **Common Errors**:
        - It is incorrect to say, _"We told thanks,"_ or _"We spoke thanks."_
        - Correct usage: _"We said thanks."_
2. **Reporting with "Say" or "Tell"**
    
    - When you have a sentence with **multiple words** (not just one word), you can use either **"say"** or **"tell"**, but they are different.
    - **Say**:
        - You can include or exclude **"that"** after "say." Both options are correct.
        - **Example**: _"Dave says that strawberries grow in his garden."_ / _"Dave says strawberries grow in his garden."_
        - When reporting in the past, you can use **both the present and past form** of the verb in the reported clause:
            - _"Dave said that strawberries grow in his garden."_
            - _"Dave said that strawberries grew in his garden."_
            - Both versions are **correct** and interchangeable in this context.
    - **Tell**:
        - With **"tell"**, you must always include a **recipient** (someone being told).
        - **Examples**:
            - _"Dave tells me that strawberries grow in his garden."_
            - _"Dave told me that strawberries grew in his garden."_
        - Most importantly, with **tell**, you need to specify **someone**:
            - _"Dave tells Peter, Sarah, or everyone."_
            - Incorrect: _"Dave told that..."_ (It must be followed by _someone_).

#### **Common Errors with "Say" and "Tell"**

- **Incorrect Phrases**:
    - _"He told that..."_ is incorrect.
    - _"Dave said me..."_ is incorrect.
- **Correct Usage**:
    - _"Dave told me that..."_ is correct.

#### **Imperative Orders and Reporting Them**

3. **Imperative Sentences** (Orders)
    - **Definition**:
        - Imperatives are orders or commands, like _"Wait," "Stop," "Sit down," "Run to the shop."_
        - These sentences are **direct instructions** telling someone what to do.
    - **Examples of Imperatives**:
        - _"Wait for me in the corridor."_
        - _"Pass me the salt, please."_
    - **Reporting Imperatives**:
        - Use **"tell"** or **"ask"** to report orders or requests.
        - You must use **"to + infinitive"** after "tell" or "ask" in reported speech:
            - **Example**: _"He told them to wait for him in the corridor."_
            - _"She asked me to pass the salt."_
        - **Difference Between Tell and Ask**:
            - **"Tell"** is more direct and gives a clear order.
            - **"Ask"** is more **polite** and indicates a request.
            - _Example_: _"He told the pupils to wait in the corridor."_ vs. _"He asked the pupils to wait in the corridor."_
