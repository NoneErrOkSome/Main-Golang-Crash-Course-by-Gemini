#### **Using "Say," "Tell," and Reporting Speech**

##### **Using "Say" and "Tell" in Different Contexts**

1. **Reporting with "Say" and "Tell"**
    
    - When reporting a **past event**:
        - **Example**: _"Dave said that strawberries grow in his garden."_
            - You can use the present form in the reported clause because the information may still be true.
        - **Example**: _"Dave said that strawberries grew in his garden."_
            - Using the past form here emphasizes the **past perspective**, although both versions are correct and interchangeable.
    - When using **"tell"** in the past:
        - You can use either **"grow"** or **"grew"** to indicate the state of the strawberries.
        - **Examples**:
            - _"Dave told me strawberries grow in his garden."_
            - _"Dave told me strawberries grew in his garden."_
            - Both are **correct** and convey a similar meaning.
2. **Rules for Using "Tell"**
    
    - When using **"tell"**, you **must** include a recipient (i.e., someone you are telling).
    - Examples of correct usage:
        - _"Dave told me that strawberries grow in his garden."_
        - _"Dave tells Peter, Sarah, or everyone."_
    - Incorrect Usage:
        - _"Dave told that..."_ is incorrect because there is no recipient mentioned.
        - Correct it by adding a person: _"Dave told me that..."_ or _"Dave told them that..."_

##### **Future Tense with "Tell"**

- **"Tell"** can also be used in the **future tense**:
    - **Example**: _"Dave will tell everyone that strawberries grow in his garden."_
    - This indicates that **in the future**, Dave plans to inform people.

#### **Common Errors and Correct Usage Recap**

- **Incorrect Phrases**:
    
    - _"Dave said me..."_ – This is incorrect.
    - Correct form: _"Dave said that..."_ (No need for a recipient with "say").
    - _"Dave told that..."_ – Incorrect because the sentence is missing someone being told.
    - Correct form: _"Dave told me that..."_
- **Summary of Correct Usage**:
    
    - **Say**: Used to report speech, no need for specifying to whom.
        - _"Dave said that strawberries grow in his garden."_
    - **Tell**: Requires a recipient, indicating to whom the information is directed.
        - _"Dave told us that strawberries grow in his garden."_

#### **Imperative Orders and Reporting Them (Continued)**

##### **Imperatives: Commands and Requests**

3. **Using "Tell" and "Ask" for Reporting Orders**
    - **Imperative** statements are commands or instructions that tell someone what to do.
    - Examples of imperative statements:
        - _"Wait for me in the corridor."_
        - _"Pass me the salt, please."_
    - When **reporting** an imperative, you must use **"tell"** or **"ask"** followed by **"to + infinitive"**.
        - Example:
            - _"He told them to wait for him in the corridor."_
            - _"She asked me to pass the salt."_
        - The **infinitive form** (e.g., "to wait," "to pass") is used after "tell" or "ask" when reporting the command.

##### **Difference Between Tell and Ask in Imperatives**

- **Tell**: Used to give an **order** or a **directive**.
    - It is more direct and is often used for instructions that must be followed.
    - Example:
        - _"He told the pupils to wait in the corridor."_
        - This is an **order** and implies authority.
- **Ask**: Used to make a **polite request**.
    - It is less forceful than "tell" and suggests a more considerate approach.
    - Example:
        - _"He asked the pupils to wait in the corridor."_
        - This implies that the speaker is making a polite request rather than issuing a direct order.

#### **Say, Tell, Ask: Detailed Examples**

4. **Imperative Examples with Reporting Speech**
    - **Orders**: When giving orders, use "tell."
        - _"He told them to wait."_
        - _"He told Dave to wait for him in the corridor."_
        - Always include **someone** after "tell."
    - **Requests**: When giving polite suggestions, use "ask."
        - _"She asked me to pass the salt."_
        - _"She asked Peter to give her the salt."_
        - "Ask" suggests politeness, whereas "tell" implies a directive.
    - Both "tell" and "ask" can be used with **"to + infinitive"** to report actions:
        - _"He asked Dave to wait for him."_
        - _"She asked me to pass the salt."_

#### **Reporting Speech with Specific Words: Something, Anything, Nothing**

5. **Using "Say" with "Something, Anything, Nothing"**
    
    - **Something, Anything, Nothing** are often used with **"say"** in reported speech.
    - Examples:
        - **Positive Sentence**: _"Dave says something every lesson."_
            - This indicates that every lesson, Dave talks or provides information.
        - **Negative Sentences**:
            - _"Dave didn’t say anything yesterday."_
                - This indicates that Dave was silent; "anything" is used here to indicate a lack of speech.
            - _"Dave said nothing."_
                - This is synonymous with the previous example but uses **"nothing"** instead of **"anything"**.
6. **Future Tense and Negatives with "Say"**
    
    - **Future Tense**:
        - _"Dave will say nothing tomorrow."_ or _"Dave won’t say anything tomorrow."_
        - Both are negative forms, indicating that Dave will not provide any information in the future.
    - **Synonyms**:
        - "Say nothing" and "won’t say anything" are **synonymous** in this context.
        - They convey the same meaning but use different structures to indicate a lack of speech.
