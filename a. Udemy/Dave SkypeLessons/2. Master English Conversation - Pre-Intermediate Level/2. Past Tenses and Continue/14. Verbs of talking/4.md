    - **Context**: Typically used in an educational setting or when giving detailed information.
    - **Example**:
        - _"The teacher explained the present tenses in the first few classes."_
        - _"I am explaining how verbs of talking work."_
    - **Usage**:
        - Use **"explain"** when you need to make something clear to someone else.
        - It’s a **regular verb**, and its past form is **"explained"**.
        - Often followed by what is being explained, such as _"the grammar"_ or _"the meaning."_

2. **Shout, Yell, Scream**
    - These verbs indicate **loud verbal expressions**, but there are differences in their specific use:
        
    - **Shout and Yell**:
        
        - **Meaning**: To speak loudly, often because of anger, excitement, or trying to be heard over a distance.
        - **Context**: Used when words are involved and spoken with high volume.
        - **Example**:
            - _"They were shouting my name."_ (E.g., "Dave! Dave!")
        - **Difference Between Shout and Yell**:
            - Both verbs involve **loud speech**, but "yell" often has a more emotional context, such as anger or distress.
    - **Scream**:
        
        - **Meaning**: A loud, high-pitched sound, usually without words. It is often a reaction to fear, pain, or excitement.
        - **Example**:
            - _"The baby was screaming because he was hungry."_
            - This is different from shouting or yelling because it involves no words—just a loud sound.
        - **Usage**: Typically describes a **non-verbal** vocal response to extreme emotions.

##### **Practical Contexts for Shout, Yell, Scream**:

- **Shout/Yell** is used when calling out names or trying to grab attention:

3. **Whisper**
    - **Meaning**: To speak very quietly, usually when trying to be discreet or not be heard by others.
    - **Context**: Often used in settings where silence is required, or you want only one person to hear you.
    - **Example**:
        - _"During the exam, my neighbour whispered the answer in my ear."_
    - **Usage**:
        - Whispering is associated with **low volume**, typically used to communicate secretly or in quiet settings.
        - Can also indicate an act of **cheating** or **helping** in a subtle way, as in the given example.

    - _"My friend whispered the answer to me during the test."_

5. **Suggest**

            - _"I suggested that we buy an ice cream."_
            - _"I suggested buying an ice cream."_

        - **Suggest** is about proposing **ideas** or **actions**, while **offer** involves providing **physical items** or **help**.
