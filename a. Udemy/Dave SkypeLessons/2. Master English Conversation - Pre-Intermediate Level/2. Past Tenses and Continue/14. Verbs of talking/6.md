        - Use "say" when giving information, without specifying who is being told.
        - **Examples**:
            - _"She said that the meeting was postponed."_
            - You do not need to mention a direct recipient with "say."

        - **Examples**:
            - _"He told me that he would be late."_

- **Say** is neutral and can be used for both statements and casual remarks.
- **Tell** is direct and requires specifying a recipient, implying that the speaker is directing information to someone.
