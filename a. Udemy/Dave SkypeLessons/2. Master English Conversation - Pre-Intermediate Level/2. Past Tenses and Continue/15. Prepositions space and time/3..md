Continuing with Part 3/8, this section focuses on the preposition **"at"** and its use in different contexts involving **time** and **space**. The explanations here aim to clarify the specificity of "at" in comparison to other prepositions like "in" and "on."

### **Part 3/8: Detailed Explanation of the Preposition "At"**

**1. Preposition "At" for Time**

- The preposition **"at"** is used to indicate **specific times** or **precise points** on the clock. Unlike **"in"** (which is more general) or **"on"** (which is specific to days and dates), **"at"** is used when you are referring to an **exact moment**.

**2. Specific Uses of "At" for Time**

- **Exact Times on the Clock**:
    - Examples include:
        - "**At 3:30**"
        - "**At 1:00**"
        - "**At 10:45**"
    - The instructor mentions these examples to indicate that **"at"** is used whenever we want to talk about a **precise time**. This specificity is highlighted by referring to the **clock** or **watch**.
    - Emphasizing **time-telling**:
        - The instructor repeats times in both numerical and word forms:
            - "**At 3:30**" (repeated as "**three-thirty**")
            - "**At 7:15**" – clarified as "**quarter past seven**"
            - "**At 10:45**" – noted as "**quarter to eleven**" or "**ten forty-five**"
            - "**At 20 to 9**" – expressed as "**eight forty**"
        - The instructor emphasizes the concept of using **past** and **to** in telling time, which is necessary when using **"at."**

**3. Exceptions for "At" in Time**

- The instructor provides specific exceptions to clarify when **"at"** should be used:
    1. **"At night"**:
        - **"At night"** is used to describe the general period after the sun sets, rather than using **"in night"**. This is an exception because other parts of the day use **"in"** (e.g., **in the morning**).
    2. **"At the weekend"**:
        - **"At the weekend"** is the form that the dictionary specifies as correct, although some people use **"on the weekend"** as an alternative. The instructor points out this difference as a regional variation or preference, but officially, **"at the weekend"** is more widely accepted.
    3. **Festivals**:
        - The preposition **"at"** is also used for **festival periods** when referring to multiple days:
            - "**At Christmas**" is used to refer to the **entire Christmas period**, which spans several days (e.g., December 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 25th).
            - Similarly, "**At Easter**" is used because Easter typically includes more than just one day, making it more of a time period rather than a specific day.
        - However, for **specific holiday days**:
            - **"On Christmas Day"** – The instructor explains that **Christmas Day** (December 25th) is treated as a specific, individual day and therefore requires **"on."**

**4. Using "At" for Age**

- Another important usage of **"at"** is to describe age milestones:
    - Examples include:
        - "**At 18, you can vote.**"
        - "**At 17, you can learn to drive.**"
        - "**At 21, you can buy a house.**"
    - The use of **"at"** here signifies an **exact point in age** when a person becomes eligible for a certain activity. It marks a specific time in a person's life when a transition or eligibility occurs.

**5. Summary of "At" for Time**

- **"At"** is used for:
    - **Specific times**: **"At 3:30," "At 10:45," "At 7:15."**
    - **Night**: **"At night"** (an exception to the general rule).
    - **Weekend**: The dictionary prefers **"at the weekend"**, although **"on the weekend"** is also heard.
    - **Festivals**: **"At Christmas," "At Easter"** (referring to the entire period).
    - **Age**: Used for describing eligibility or milestones: **"At 18," "At 21."**

**6. Preposition "At" for Space**

- The preposition **"at"** is used for describing **specific points in space**.
- The idea here is that **"at"** indicates a **pinpoint location** rather than an area or surface. It is often used to refer to **events, places of activity**, or **specific points** in a larger area.

**7. Uses of "At" for Specific Locations**

- **Events and Activities**:
    - **"At work," "at school," "at university"** are used to describe being at a **specific place of activity**.
    - The instructor notes that these locations are treated as **fixed points** of activity rather than general locations.
- **Precise Places**:
    - Examples include:
        - "**At the station**," "**at the bus stop**," "**at the party**," and "**at home**"
        - Here, **"at"** is used to show **specificity** and **precision**.
        - The instructor repeats the need to **memorize** places like **"at work," "at home," "at school,"** as these are commonly used expressions.
- **Points of Arrival or Interaction**:
    - **"At the door"** – The instructor explains:
        - **"Someone is at the door"** is used to indicate that someone is waiting at the **specific point** where the door is located.
        - This use of **"at"** suggests a very specific **point of interaction**.

**8. Summary of "At" for Space**

- **"At"** is used for:
    - **Specific events or activities**: **"At work," "at school," "at university," "at home"**.
    - **Specific points of transportation or interaction**: **"At the station," "at the bus stop," "at the door."**
    - **Top and Bottom Points**:
        - The instructor also adds examples like:
            - "**At the top of the picture**" or "**at the bottom of the board**"
            - **"At the top"** and **"at the bottom"** are used to refer to **specific points** relative to an object, suggesting precision.

**9. Clarification Between "At" and Other Prepositions**

- **"At" vs. "In" vs. "On"**:
    - The instructor provides multiple clarifications to show how **"at"** is used differently:
        - **"At"** is for **specific points** (both in time and space).
        - **"On"** is for **specific days or surfaces**.
        - **"In"** is for **enclosed areas** or **general timeframes**.

        - **Points on an object** (e.g., at the top, at the bottom).

In the next part (Part 4/8), I will explain the prepositions in terms of **spatial uses** and delve into more detailed comparisons to solidify understanding. Let me know if you have any questions about **"at"** before proceeding!
