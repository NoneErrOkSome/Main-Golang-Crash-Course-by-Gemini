Continuing with Part 2/8, I will provide a detailed breakdown focusing on the preposition **"on"** and its specific uses, especially related to **time**. This part also emphasizes contrasting "on" with other prepositions like "in" to clarify when each should be used.

### **Part 2/8: Detailed Explanation of the Preposition "On"**

**1. Preposition "On" for Time**

- The preposition **"on"** is used to refer to **specific days and dates**. Unlike **"in,"** which is used for more generalized periods (like months or seasons), **"on"** is more specific, applied to exact dates or single days.

**2. Uses of "On" with Specific Days**

- The instructor explains that **"on"** is used for **days of the week** or **single-day events**:
    - **Examples** of days:
        - "**On Monday**," "**On Friday**," etc. Here, the use of **"on"** emphasizes that we are referring to an individual day of the week.
    - **Important Dates**:
        - The preposition **"on"** is also used for **specific calendar dates**:
            - "**On March 22nd**" - This indicates a specific day, and thus **"on"** is necessary.
    - The instructor emphasizes that **single days** (like a birthday or a particular day of the week) use **"on"** because they represent a unique, identifiable day.

**3. Specific Examples of Using "On" with Dates**

- **Holidays**:
    - The preposition **"on"** is used for **specific holidays** that are treated as **single days**:
        - Examples include:
            - "**On New Year's Day**" (New Year’s Day is **January 1st**, which is a single specific day).
            - "**On my birthday**" – The birthday itself is a specific day, making the use of **"on"** appropriate.
- **Birthdates**:
    - An example involving personal information:
        - "**My birthday is on March 8th**."
        - Here, "March 8th" is treated as a **specific point in time**.

**4. Clarification Between "On" and "In"**

- The instructor contrasts the prepositions **"in"** and **"on"** to avoid confusion:
    - **"In"** is used for broader timeframes (e.g., **months** and **years**), whereas **"on"** is applied to **specific days or single-day events**.
    - Example:
        - "**In March**" vs. "**On March 22nd**"
        - "**In January**" (used to describe something occurring within the month in general) vs. "**On January 15th**" (used for a specific day within that month).

**5. "On" for Holidays and Weekends**

- The instructor also explains the difference between **"on"** and **"at"** when it comes to holidays and weekends:
    - **One-Day Holidays**:
        - **On** is used for **specific holiday days** like:
            - "**On Christmas Day**" – Since **Christmas Day** (December 25th) is a specific single day, **"on"** is correct.
    - **Weekends**:
        - **On the weekend**:
            - The instructor mentions that some people use **"on the weekend"**, while others use **"at the weekend."**
            - The dictionary generally states **"at the weekend"** as correct, but **"on the weekend"** is also commonly used, indicating variation based on regions or individual preferences.

**6. Examples of Using "On" in Specific Situations**

- The instructor uses multiple examples to clarify specific days:
    - "**On March the 8th**" or "**on the 8th of March**" are both correct forms, and they are synonyms when referring to the exact date of an event.
    - The idea is to emphasize the **specificity** of the day, which is why **"on"** is used.

**7. Practical Situations for "On"**

- To make it relatable, the instructor describes:
    - Events like **birthdays**:
        - "**On my birthday**," indicating the use of **"on"** because the birthday is **one day**.
    - Days of the week:
        - "**On Friday**," highlighting that days of the week are treated individually and need **"on."**

**8. General Rule for "On"**

- The **general rule** summarized by the instructor:
    - Use **"on"** for anything that happens on a **specific day**.
    - This could be a **day of the week** (like Monday, Tuesday), a **holiday** treated as a single day (like Christmas Day), or an **important date** (like March 8th).

### Summary for Part 2/8

- **Preposition "On"** is used for:
    - **Days of the Week** (e.g., on Monday, on Friday).
    - **Specific Dates** (e.g., on March 22nd, on January 1st).
    - **One-Day Holidays or Special Days** (e.g., on New Year’s Day, on my birthday).
    - **Weekends**: Mentioned as having variability between **"on the weekend"** and **"at the weekend"**, depending on the context.

In the next part (Part 3/8), I will delve into the use of **"at"** as a preposition, focusing on both time and space. Let me know if you need further clarifications about "on" before proceeding!
