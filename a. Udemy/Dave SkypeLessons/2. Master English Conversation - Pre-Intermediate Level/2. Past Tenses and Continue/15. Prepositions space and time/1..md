That’s quite a lengthy transcript! I'll split the detailed breakdown into 8 parts, starting with Part 1/8, and I’ll ensure that every detail is preserved. Let's dive in:

### **Part 1/8: Introduction to Prepositions of Time and Space**

**1. Introduction to Prepositions:**

- The lesson starts by highlighting that **prepositions** are **small words** used to describe **position** and often cover words like **in, on,** and **at**.
- Prepositions are fundamental when discussing **space** and **time**.

**2. Topic: Prepositions of Time**

- The instructor emphasizes that prepositions **in, on, at** are used for different aspects of **time** and each serves a specific function.

**3. Preposition "In" for Time**

- **"In" is used for**:
    1. **Months**:
        
        - Examples (without specifying the same month repeatedly to emphasize use):
            - "In January"
            - "In February"
            - "In March"
            - These examples are used to clarify that **months** always take the preposition **in**.
    2. **Seasons**:
        
        - Examples include:
            - "In spring," "in summer," "in autumn," "in winter"
            - **Explanation of Seasons**:
                - **Spring**: Described as a time when flowers start to **appear** or **come out**.
                    - Flowers grow in gardens, and trees **grow leaves** in spring.
                    - **Autumn**: In contrast to spring, **leaves fall down** or **fall off** the trees. The comparison is made to **falling off** a bike, emphasizing the motion of something dropping from a height or surface.
    3. **Years**:
        
        - Used with **years** to indicate **a general period**.
            - "In 2003"
            - "In 1989"
            - The instructor mentions, "I was born **in 1979**," and repeats it multiple times to emphasize the use of **in** with **years**.
    4. **Parts of the Day**:
        
        - Used with **morning, afternoon, evening**:
            - "In the morning"
            - "In the afternoon"
            - "In the evening"
            - These are described as **parts of the day** and therefore require **in**.
    5. **Future References**:
        
        - Used when talking about **something happening in the future**.
            - For example, "**in five minutes**" means **five minutes from now**.
            - Examples to indicate future time frames:
                - "**In two hours**" (meaning two hours from now, at a later point)
                - "**In a few minutes**" or "**in a moment**" to refer to very soon.

**4. Contrast with the Preposition "On" for Specific Days**

- The instructor draws a comparison between **"in"** and **"on"**:
    - When talking about **specific days**:
        - "On March 22nd" (because it is a **single day**)
        - Other examples:
            - "**On Friday**," "**On my birthday**," and "**On New Year's Day**"

**5. "In" for Seasons and Examples**

- Detailed mentions of each **season** are given:
    - **Spring**: "Flowers appear in spring," and trees grow new leaves.
    - **Autumn**: Leaves **fall off** trees.
    - The seasonal cycle is emphasized:
        - Spring for **growth** and autumn for **leaves falling**.

**6. "In" for Years and Past Events**

- The use of **in** with **years** is expanded upon.
    - Personal example: "**I was born in 1979**." This is repeated for emphasis, indicating that **in** is used to reference **a time in the past**.

**7. Specific Times of the Day and the Future**

- Mention of **specific periods** of the day using **in**:
    - "**In the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening**"
- Reference to future events using **in**:
    - The instructor gives multiple scenarios like:
        - "**In two hours**" from 1:00 means at **3:00**.
        - "**In a moment**" or "**in a few minutes**" to indicate **something very soon**.

### Summary for Part 1/8

- **Preposition "In"** is used for:
    - **Months** (e.g., January, February)
    - **Seasons** (e.g., spring, summer, autumn, winter)
    - **Years** (e.g., 1989, 2003)
    - **Parts of the Day** (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening)
    - **Future Events** (e.g., in two hours, in ten minutes)

In the next part (Part 2/8), I will provide detailed explanations about **"on"** and its uses, focusing on specific days, dates, and how it contrasts with other prepositions. Let me know if you need any further clarification before we proceed to the next part!
