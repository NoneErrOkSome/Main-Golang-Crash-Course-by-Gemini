### **6. Positive, Negative, and Question Forms in Present Continuous**

#### **Instructor’s Explanation**:
The instructor highlighted that in the **present continuous tense**, we can create:
1. **Positive statements** (what we are doing).
2. **Negative statements** (what we are not doing).
3. **Questions** (what we or others are doing, in question form).

The structure for each form uses **am, is, are** followed by a verb with **-ing**:
- **Positive**: "I am walking."
- **Negative**: "I am not walking."
- **Question**: "Am I walking?"

He also mentioned that present continuous is used to talk about actions happening **right now** or **currently in progress**.

### **1. Structuring Positive, Negative, and Question Forms in Present Continuous**

The present continuous tense follows a straightforward pattern. Let’s look at each form:

#### **a. Positive Statements**:
To say what someone **is doing right now**, use:
- **Subject + am/is/are + verb-ing**.

Examples:
- "**I am reading** a book."
- "**She is cooking** dinner."
- "**They are playing** outside."

Notice that **am, is, or are** depends on the subject:
- **“Am”** for “I” – "**I am watching** a movie."
- **“Is”** for singular subjects (he, she, it, or names) – "**He is walking** to school."
- **“Are”** for plural subjects (they, we, you) – "**They are laughing** together."

#### **b. Negative Statements**:
To say what someone **is not doing** right now, use:
- **Subject + am/is/are + not + verb-ing**.

Examples:
- "**I am not reading** a book."
- "**She is not cooking** dinner."
- "**They are not playing** outside."

Negative sentences are helpful when you want to clarify that an action is **not** taking place at the moment.

#### **c. Questions**:
To ask what someone **is doing right now**, start with **am/is/are** followed by the subject, then the verb-ing.

- **Am/Is/Are + subject + verb-ing**?

Examples:
- "**Am I doing** this correctly?"
- "**Is she cooking** dinner?"
- "**Are they playing** outside?"

This structure is essential for asking questions in present continuous, as it focuses on actions happening **at the moment**.

### **2. Detailed Examples for Each Form**

Let’s explore additional examples for each form to reinforce the structure:

#### **Positive Statements**:
Imagine describing a typical family scene using positive present continuous statements:
- "My mom **is baking** cookies in the kitchen."
- "My dad **is watching** a documentary on TV."
- "My sister **is studying** for her exam."
- "My brother **is playing** with his toy cars."

Here, each action is happening **right now**, making it suitable for present continuous.

#### **Negative Statements**:
Now, if we wanted to describe what each family member **is not doing**, we would use negative present continuous:
- "My mom **is not baking** a cake; she **is baking** cookies."
- "My dad **is not watching** a movie; he **is watching** a documentary."
- "My sister **is not playing**; she **is studying**."
- "My brother **is not reading**; he **is playing**."

Using negative statements allows you to clarify specific actions that are **not occurring** at the moment.

#### **Questions**:
Questions in present continuous are useful for checking if someone is engaged in an action right now:
- "Is mom **baking** cookies?"
- "Are you **watching** TV?"
- "Is your sister **studying** for her exam?"
- "Are they **playing** outside?"

Questions like these help to **confirm** or **ask about** actions that are ongoing.

### **3. Common Mistakes and Tips for Positive, Negative, and Question Forms**

When constructing sentences in present continuous, there are a few common mistakes to watch for:

#### **a. Forgetting to Use “am, is, are”**:
Since the **be verb (am, is, are)** is essential in present continuous, omitting it changes the meaning of the sentence.

- **Incorrect**: "I going to the store."
- **Correct**: "I **am going** to the store."

Always make sure to include **am, is, or are** before the verb-ing form.

#### **b. Using the Wrong Form of “to be”**:
The choice of **am, is, are** depends on the subject, so using the wrong form is a common mistake.

- **Incorrect**: "They is eating dinner."
- **Correct**: "They **are eating** dinner."

Be sure to match **am, is, or are** to the subject correctly.

#### **c. Confusing Present Simple with Present Continuous**:
Present continuous is for **current actions** (right now), whereas present simple is for **general facts or habits**.

- **Incorrect for present continuous**: "He reads a book."
  - This is present simple, which implies a habitual action.
- **Correct for present continuous**: "He **is reading** a book."
  - This means he’s reading **at the moment**.

### **Examples of Correct Usage and Adding Details**

To make your present continuous statements more vivid, try adding **extra details** about the action. Let’s look at how to enhance each type of statement:

#### **Positive Statements with Details**:
- "I **am sitting** by the window **and enjoying** the sunshine."
- "She **is writing** a letter **to her best friend**."
- "They **are laughing** **together** at a funny story."

Adding details like **where, who, what, or how** makes your descriptions richer and clearer.

#### **Negative Statements with Details**:
- "I **am not sitting** on the sofa; I **am sitting** on the chair."
- "He **is not listening** to music; he **is watching** a movie."
- "We **are not going** out tonight; we **are staying** home."

This helps clarify not only what someone **is not** doing but also what they **are** doing instead.

#### **Questions with Details**:
When you add specific details to questions, it can make them more precise and relevant:

- "Are you **studying** **for tomorrow’s test**?"
- "Is she **cooking dinner** **for the family**?"
- "Are they **playing outside** **in the park**?"

Adding details to questions can guide the conversation to focus on particular actions, helping to clarify what you want to know.

### **Practice with Positive, Negative, and Question Forms**

#### **Negative Statements**:
Describe what is not happening right now:
- "I **am not checking** emails at the moment."

Practice asking about actions you’re curious about:
