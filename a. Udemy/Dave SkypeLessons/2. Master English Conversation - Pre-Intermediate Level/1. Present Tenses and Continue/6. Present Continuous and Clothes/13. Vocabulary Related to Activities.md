### **1. Structure and Components of Present Continuous Questions**

To form questions in the present continuous, we follow a simple structure:

#### **Basic Structure**:
- **[Question word] + am/is/are + [subject] + [verb + -ing] + [object or other details]**
  
For example:
- “What are you doing?”
- “Is she reading a book?”

Let’s break down the components:
- **Question Word**: Words like *what*, *where*, *how*, *who*, and *why* can start the question. These question words add context by specifying the type of information you’re looking for.
- **Auxiliary Verb (am/is/are)**: These verbs show the tense and must agree with the subject (e.g., “am” with “I,” “is” with “he/she/it,” and “are” with “you/we/they”).
- **Subject**: The person or thing performing the action (e.g., you, she, they).
- **Verb in -ing Form**: The main action in present continuous form, indicating what’s happening (e.g., doing, reading, cooking).
  
This structure helps ensure that the question is in the correct tense and clearly asks about actions currently happening.

#### **Examples of Basic Questions with Structure Analysis**
1. **"What are you reading?"**
   - *Question Word*: What (asks about the object of the action)
   - *Auxiliary Verb*: are
   - *Subject*: you
   - *Verb in -ing Form*: reading
  
2. **"Is he playing soccer?"**
   - *Auxiliary Verb*: is
   - *Subject*: he
   - *Verb in -ing Form*: playing
   - *Object*: soccer

By following this structure, you can create questions that accurately inquire about ongoing actions.
