### **1. When to Use “Tell” vs. “Say” and “Speak”**

#### **Using “Tell”**
"Tell" is used to give information, instructions, or stories **to someone specific**. It always implies that the information is directed at someone who is the **recipient**:
- **Structure**: “Tell” is often followed by a person (the listener) and then the information.
  - Example: **“I tell my students to practice their vocabulary every day.”**
  
Here, **“tell”** implies that the speaker is directing specific advice to the students, making the phrase personal and instructional.

#### **Using “Say”**
“Say” is generally used to report or state something but doesn’t require a specific listener:
- **Structure**: "Say" can stand alone with a statement, or it can specify what was said, without necessarily directing it to a person.
  - Example: **“She said that practice is important.”**
  - Example with a person: **“She said to him that practice is important.”**

In this case, “say” is more about the content being expressed, and less about who is receiving the information.

#### **Using “Speak” and “Talk”**
Both “speak” and “talk” refer to general verbal communication but aren’t as focused on conveying specific information or instruction:
- **“Speak”** can refer to the ability or action of verbal communication in a formal sense.
  - Example: **“She speaks English fluently.”**

- **“Talk”** is often more casual and conversational.
  - Example: **“They talked about their weekend plans.”**

“Tell” is distinct because it conveys not only communication but also the transfer of specific information or advice to a particular person.

### **2. Practical Usage in Giving Advice, Information, and Stories**

The verb “tell” is particularly useful when you are:
- **Giving Instructions or Advice**: To guide someone on what to do or not to do.
  - Example: **“I tell my friend to avoid spending too much time on social media.”**
  
  Here, "tell" shows that the speaker is offering direct advice aimed at helping the friend.

- **Sharing Information**: To inform someone about something that may be unknown to them.
  - Example: **“She told her parents about her new job offer.”**
  
  In this sentence, the phrase implies the act of conveying news to specific people (her parents).

- **Relaying a Story or Anecdote**: “Tell” is commonly used when sharing stories, experiences, or anecdotes.
  - Example: **“He told us a funny story about his first day at work.”**
  
  Here, “tell” implies that he directed his story specifically to an audience (“us”), making it clear that it was meant for a group.

Using “tell” in these ways makes communication direct and ensures the listener understands that the information or advice is meant specifically for them.

### **3. Expanding on Everyday Scenarios with Examples**

To deepen your understanding, let’s go through some real-world situations where “tell” would be ideal, reinforcing the concept with clear examples.

#### **Scenario 1: Parental Advice**
When parents want to guide their children, they often “tell” them things meant to improve or instruct:
- **Example**: **“My mother tells me to be careful when walking alone at night.”**
  
  This is advice, making it personal and directive, with “tell” used to show it’s intended to help the speaker.

#### **Scenario 2: Reporting News**
“Telling” someone news involves delivering information in a way that directly impacts the listener:
- **Example**: **“He told his colleagues about the company’s new policy changes.”**
  
  Using “tell” here means the information was conveyed with intent to inform those specific people (the colleagues).

#### **Scenario 3: Storytelling with Friends**
When you share a story with friends, “tell” helps identify the people you’re speaking to and clarifies that it’s a narrative meant for them:
- **Example**: **“I told my friends about my recent trip to the mountains.”**

Here, “tell” connects the speaker to the listeners, making it clear that the story is directed to a specific group.

#### **Scenario 4: Workplace Instructions**
In a work setting, “tell” is useful for giving direct instructions or guidelines, often to ensure tasks are completed correctly:
- **Example**: **“The manager tells the team to submit their reports by Friday.”**

Using “tell” here shows a direct communication line from the manager to the team, making it clear that the message is authoritative and specific.

### **Practical Tips for Using “Tell” Confidently in English**

1. **Follow the Pattern: Subject + Tell + Person + Information**:
   - This structure clarifies who is speaking, who is listening, and what information is being conveyed.
   - Example: “I tell my students that practice improves their language skills.”

2. **Distinguish between “Tell” and “Say” Based on Specificity**:
   - Use “tell” when there’s a direct recipient, making the message clear and personal.
   - Example: “She told me the instructions were easy.”

3. **Use “Tell” to Emphasize Instruction or Direct Information**:
   - Whenever you’re providing advice, instructions, or direct information to someone, “tell” is usually the best choice.
   - Example: “The coach tells the players to stay focused.”
