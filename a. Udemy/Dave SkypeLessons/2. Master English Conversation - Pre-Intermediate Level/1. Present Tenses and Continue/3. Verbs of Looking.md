### 1. **Look at**

   - **Usage**: "Look at" is used when you intentionally direct your attention to something. You’re not just passively seeing it; you’re actively observing or inspecting it.

### 2. **See**

   - **Purpose**: Use "see" to describe things you notice unintentionally, like people on the street or scenery from a window.
