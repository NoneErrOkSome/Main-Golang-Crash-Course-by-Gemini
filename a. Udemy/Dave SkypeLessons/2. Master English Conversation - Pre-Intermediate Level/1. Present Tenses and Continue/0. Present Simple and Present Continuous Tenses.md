**Stative Verbs**

**Definition:**

Stative verbs describe a state of being, thought, or emotion, rather than an action. They typically relate to:

- **Emotions:** love, hate, like, prefer
- **Possession:** have, own, belong
- **Senses:** see, hear, taste, smell
- **Thoughts/Beliefs:** know, believe, understand, think (when expressing an opinion)
- **Desires:** want, need, desire

**Key Rule:**

**Stative verbs are not used in the continuous form**, even when describing a current situation.

**Incorrect Usage:**

- "I **am wanting** a coffee."
- "She **is knowing** the answer."
- "They **are needing** help."

**Correct Usage:**

- "I **want** a coffee."
- "She **knows** the answer."
- "They **need** help."

**Exceptions:**

Some verbs can be both stative and dynamic, depending on their meaning in context.

- **Think:**
  - Stative (opinion): "I **think** it's a good idea."
  - Dynamic (considering): "I **am thinking** about changing jobs."

- **Have:**
  - Stative (possession): "He **has** a new car."
  - Dynamic (experience): "We **are having** dinner now."

**Practice with Stative Verbs:**

- "Do you **believe** in aliens?"
- "I **don't understand** this problem."
- "She **loves** classical music."

**Using Phrasal Verbs**

Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with one or two particles (prepositions or adverbs) that create a new meaning.

**Examples:**

- **Run away:** To escape.
