#### **Present Simple: Additional Details**

##### **Using Signal Words with Present Simple**

- Signal words indicate the need for Present Simple because they describe habitual or regular actions:
    
    - _Always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never._
    - _Every day, every week, on Mondays, three times a month._
- **Examples**:
    
    - "I eat breakfast every day at 10:00."
    - "They play football every Monday."

##### **Positive Sentences**

- Formed by adding **-s** for third-person singular (_he, she, it_):
    
    - _"He works in a restaurant."_
    - _"She makes courses for her students."_
- **Important Rule**:
    
    - For third-person singular, **do not forget the -s**:
        - Correct: "He works."
        - Incorrect: "He work."

##### **Negative Sentences**

- Use **don’t** for _I, you, we, they_:
    
    - _"I don’t watch TV."_
    - _"We don’t play football every day."_
- Use **doesn’t** for _he, she, it_:
    
    - _"He doesn’t work in a school."_
    - _"She doesn’t watch my lectures."_

##### **Questions**

- Use **do** or **does** at the beginning of the question:
    - _"Where do you work?"_
    - _"Does she work in an ambulance?"_
    - _"What languages do you speak?"_

##### **Actions Happening Now**

- Emphasizes activities occurring at the moment:
    - _"I am teaching present tenses now."_
    - _"They are playing football in the garden right now."_
    - _"I am wearing a t-shirt because it is hot today."_

##### **Temporary Situations**

- Describes short-term states or actions:
    - _"I am learning Russian at the moment."_
    - _"I am living in London for a few months."_

##### **Negative Sentences**

- Use **am not, is not (isn’t), are not (aren’t)**:
    - _"I’m not learning Italian."_
    - _"Your sister isn’t watching this class."_
    - _"They aren’t waiting on the right platform."_

#### **Stative Verbs: Key Rules**

- **Definition**: Stative verbs describe states or conditions rather than actions.
- **Examples**: _Want, know, understand, need, see, believe, like, love, agree, think (opinion)._

    - Stative verbs do **not** take the continuous form.
    - Correct: "I know the answer." (Not _"I am knowing the answer."_)
    - Correct: "I need a coffee." (Not _"I am needing a coffee."_)

##### **Exception for Action Verbs**

- Some verbs like "think" and "have" can be used in continuous form when describing actions:
    - _"I am thinking about my holiday."_
    - _"I am having breakfast right now."_
