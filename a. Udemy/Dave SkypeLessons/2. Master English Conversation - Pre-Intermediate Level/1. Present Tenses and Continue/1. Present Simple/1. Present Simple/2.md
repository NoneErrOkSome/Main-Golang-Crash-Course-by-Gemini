    - _"I am wearing a white t-shirt because it is hot."_
- Present Simple is for **regular actions**:
    - _"I teach English every week."_
    - _"I usually wear a shirt, but today I am wearing a t-shirt."_

#### **Stative Verbs**

- **Stative Verbs** describe states or conditions, not actions, and are **never used in continuous forms**:
    - Examples of stative verbs: _want, know, understand, need, see, believe, like, love, agree._
- **Correct Usage**:
    - "I want a drink now." (Not _"I am wanting a drink now."_)
    - "She knows the answer." (Not _"She is knowing the answer."_)

#### **Special Notes on Stative Verbs**

- Even if the action is happening now, use Present Simple:
    - _"I need my shorts because it is hot."_ (Not _"I am needing my shorts."_)
    - _"She understands the lesson."_ (Not _"She is understanding the lesson."_)
- Exceptions (actions vs. states):
    - "I am having breakfast" is correct for actions like eating or drinking.
    - "I have a brother" (state) is in Present Simple, not Continuous.
