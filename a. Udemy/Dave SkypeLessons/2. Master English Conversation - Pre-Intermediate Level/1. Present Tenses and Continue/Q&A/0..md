Yes, **"I'm thinking follow with that"** is incorrect, while **"I think that is correct"** is correct. Let me explain why.

### **Understanding the Verb "Think"**

**1. "Think" as a Stative Verb:**

- When **"think"** is used to express an opinion or belief (meaning **"believe"**), it is a **stative verb**.
- **Stative verbs** describe a state or condition rather than an action.
- **Stative verbs are not usually used in continuous (ING) tenses.**

**Example:**

- ✅ Correct: **"I think that is correct."**
  - Here, **"think"** expresses an opinion or belief.
- ❌ Incorrect: **"I am thinking that is correct."**
  - Using **"am thinking"** in this context is incorrect because **"think"** as a stative verb should not be in the continuous tense.

**2. "Think" as an Action Verb:**

- When **"think"** refers to the process of considering or pondering something, it acts as an **action verb**.
- In this case, it can be used in the continuous tense.
- It is usually followed by **"about"** or **"of"** and a noun, pronoun, or gerund (**verb+ing** form).

**Examples:**

- ✅ Correct: **"I am thinking about my vacation."**
- ✅ Correct: **"She is thinking of moving to a new city."**

### **Why "I'm thinking follow with that" is Incorrect**

**1. Missing Preposition:**

- When using **"thinking"** in the continuous form to indicate consideration, it should be followed by a preposition like **"about"** or **"of."**
- **"I'm thinking follow with that"** lacks this necessary preposition.

**2. Incorrect Verb Form After "Thinking":**

- After **"thinking about"**, we typically use a noun or a gerund (**verb+ing** form).
- The phrase **"follow with that"** does not fit grammatically after **"thinking."**

**Correct Ways to Express the Idea:**

- ✅ **"I'm thinking about following that."**
  - Here, **"following"** is a gerund after **"thinking about."**
- ✅ **"I think I will follow that."**
  - Using **"think"** as a stative verb in the present simple tense.

### **Summary**

- **"I think that is correct."**
  - Uses **"think"** as a stative verb to express an opinion.
  - Correct in the present simple tense.
- **"I'm thinking follow with that."**
  - Incorrect because it misuses **"thinking"** without the necessary preposition and proper verb form.
  - Should be rephrased to:
    - **"I'm thinking about following that."**
    - Or **"I think I will follow that."**

### **Key Takeaways**

- Use **"think"** in the present simple tense when expressing opinions or beliefs.
- Use **"think"** in the continuous tense when considering or pondering, and include **"about"** or **"of."**
- Ensure the structure after **"thinking about/of"** is grammatically correct (noun or gerund).

### **Additional Examples**

**Stative Verb (Opinion):**

- ✅ **"I think you are right."**
- ❌ **"I am thinking you are right."**

**Action Verb (Consideration):**

- ✅ **"I'm thinking about changing jobs."**
- ✅ **"They are thinking of moving abroad."**

**Incorrect Usage:**

- ❌ **"She is thinking to buy a car."**
  - Corrected: **"She is thinking about buying a car."**

### **Conclusion**

The correctness depends on how **"think"** is used:

- For opinions or beliefs, use **present simple tense**: **"I think that..."**
- For considering something, use **present continuous tense** with **"about"**/**"of"**: **"I'm thinking about..."**

By understanding these rules, you can choose the correct form and structure in your sentences.
