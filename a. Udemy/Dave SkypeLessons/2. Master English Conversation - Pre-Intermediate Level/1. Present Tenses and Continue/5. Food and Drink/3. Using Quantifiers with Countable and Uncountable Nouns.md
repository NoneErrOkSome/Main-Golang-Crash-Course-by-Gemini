### Topic 3: Food and Drink Vocabulary

The instructor introduces a range of **food and drink items**—some common, some with specific preparation styles, and others with uncountable forms. This vocabulary is foundational as it covers items frequently encountered in supermarkets, restaurants, and in cooking. Let’s break down each category with examples and clarifications.

Fruits and vegetables are often the most varied and colorful items on a shopping list. They can also be both countable and uncountable depending on context, as the instructor points out.

- **Apple**:
  - Instructor Example: **“How many apples do you eat every day?”**
  - Additional Example: **"I like to eat an apple with my lunch each day."** Apples are countable, so you can say **"one apple," "two apples,"** etc.

- **Egg**:
  - Eggs can be cooked in various ways: **fried**, **boiled**, **scrambled**, or in **omelets**.
  - Additional Example: **"I like my eggs scrambled with a bit of salt and pepper."**
  - Note: Eggs are versatile in English cooking and appear in breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes. They’re countable, so you can say **“one egg, two eggs.”**

- **Tomato**:
  - Tomatoes are used in salads, pasta sauces, and even on sandwiches. 
  - Additional Example: **"I add tomatoes to my salad for extra flavor."**
  - Tip: In British and American English, there’s a pronunciation difference: **“tomato”** is pronounced **"to-MAH-to"** in British English and **"to-MAY-to"** in American English.

  - Instructor Note: The instructor mentions that onions are one of their favorite vegetables and adds them to many dishes.
  - Additional Example: **"Onions add a great flavor when you sauté them with garlic."**
  - Commonly used in cooking, onions are countable, so you can say, **“two onions,”** or **“a bag of onions.”**

- **Pineapple**:
  - Pineapple is a tropical fruit with a unique shape and sweet, tangy flavor.
  - Additional Example: **"Pineapple can be eaten fresh or added to smoothies."**

#### **2. Common Ingredients**
In English, common cooking ingredients like **salt, oil, sugar**, and **flour** are essential to describe, especially because they are often **uncountable nouns**.
