### **Highlighted Verbs and Usage Examples**

The instructor begins by focusing on a few core verbs, presenting examples in three formats: **positive**, **negative**, and **question** forms. Let’s break down these verbs with the instructor’s examples.

#### **1. Verb: Be**

- **Positive Sentence:** “I am English.” / “I am 44 years old.” / “I am a teacher.”
  - *Explanation:* Here, “be” is used to describe identity, age, and profession.

- **Negative Sentence:** “My brother isn’t Spanish.” / “My brother isn’t 12.” / “My brother isn’t a doctor.”
  - *Explanation:* The contraction “isn’t” means “is not,” showing how to form a negative sentence with “be.”

- **Question Form:** “How old are you?” / “Where are you from?”
  - *Explanation:* Questions with “be” simply reverse the order to begin with the verb (e.g., “Are you…?”).

**Key Notes:**  
- The verb “be” is one of the most commonly used verbs. It changes forms depending on the subject (I am, you are, he is). In English, **"be"** is essential for describing who you are, where you’re from, your profession, and more.

#### **2. Verb: Have**

- **Positive Sentence:** “I have a twin brother.”
- **Negative Sentence:** “He doesn’t have short hair.” (Notice “doesn’t” for negatives)
- **Question Form:** “Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

**Explanation and Key Points:**  
- The verb “have” is used to express possession. When forming questions or negatives, **we must say "do"** in questions, as in “Do you have?” The use of “doesn’t” in negatives, such as “He doesn’t have…,” shows correct usage for third-person singular subjects.

#### **3. Verb: Do**

- **Positive Sentence:** “I do a lot of work on Mondays.”
- **Negative Sentence:** “Sometimes, my students don’t do their homework.”
- **Question Form:** “When do you do your homework?”

**Explanation and Key Points:**  
- “Do” is both a main verb and an auxiliary verb in English. Here, it’s used to talk about activities and tasks. **In questions and negatives, we also use “do”** as an auxiliary verb (e.g., “Do you…?” “I don’t…”). 

- The phrase “When do you do your homework?” highlights the versatility of “do” in forming questions.

#### **4. Verb: Say**

- **Positive Sentence:** “My students say English is easy.”
- **Negative Sentence:** “They don’t say English is boring.”
- **Question Form:** “How do you say [word] in English?”

**Explanation and Key Points:**  
- “Say” is frequently used for reporting speech. When learning English, it’s helpful to ask, **“How do you say…?”** when you’re unsure of a word in English. The instructor encourages this phrase, making it easy for learners to inquire about new vocabulary.
