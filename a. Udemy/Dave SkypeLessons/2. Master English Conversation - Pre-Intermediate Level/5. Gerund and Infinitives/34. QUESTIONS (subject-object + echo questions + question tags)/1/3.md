### **Key Lesson 7: Prepositions at the End of Questions**

1. In English, **prepositions** (e.g., _in_, _on_, _under_, _with_, _to_) are often placed at the **end** of questions.
2. This happens when the question word (e.g., _who_, _what_, _where_) is part of a verb + preposition combination.

#### **Examples of Verb + Preposition Questions**

1. **Think about**:
    
    - _What are you thinking about?_
        - Auxiliary: _are_ (present continuous)
        - Preposition: _about_
    - **Incorrect**: _About what are you thinking?_ (not commonly used in spoken English).
2. **Live with**:
    
    - _Who do you live with?_
        - Correct (spoken): _Who do you live with?_
        - Formal but rare: _Whom do you live with?_
3. **Speak to** / **Talk to**:
    
    - _Who will you talk to?_
    - _Who will you speak to?_
        - **Alternative (Formal)**: _Whom will you speak to?_
4. **Argue about**:
    
    - _What were they arguing about?_
        - Auxiliary: _were_ (past continuous)
        - Preposition: _about_
5. **Take out**:
    
    - _Why did he take the horse out?_
        - Auxiliary: _did_
        - Preposition: _out_

#### **Key Point: Natural vs. Formal Usage**

- In natural spoken English, the preposition comes **at the end** of the question.
- While formal English (e.g., older texts, schools) may prefer prepositions at the beginning (_About what are you thinking?_), it is rarely used in modern conversation.

### **Side Lesson 5: Present Continuous vs. Present Simple in Questions**

1. **Present Continuous**: Use _am_, _is_, _are_ as auxiliary verbs.
    
    - Example: _What are you thinking about?_
        - Structure: `Question Word` → `Auxiliary Verb` → `Subject` → `Verb-ing`.
2. **Present Simple**: Use _do_ or _does_ as auxiliary verbs.
    
    - Example: _Who do you live with?_
        - Structure: `Question Word` → `Do/Does` → `Subject` → `Infinitive Verb`.
