**1 / 5 Parts**

### **Part 1: Introduction to Questions and Auxiliary Verbs**

#### **Key Lesson 1: Auxiliary Verbs**

- **Auxiliary verbs:** `do`, `does`, and `did` (for **present simple** and **past simple** tenses).
- Auxiliary verbs are used **most of the time** when forming questions.
- **Exceptions:** Sometimes questions do not use auxiliary verbs, which will be explained further.

#### **Key Lesson 2: Auxiliary Verbs and Object Questions**

1. **When the question word is the object**, you **must use auxiliary verbs** (`do`, `does`, `did`).
2. **Example**:
    - **Question**: _Who did John Straker buy a new dress for?_
        - _"Who"_ is the object of the preposition "for".
        - **Answer**: He bought a new dress for his girlfriend.
        - Explanation: Since "who" is not the subject, **did** is necessary.
3. **Structure for Object Questions**:  
    `Question Word` → `Auxiliary Verb` → `Subject` → `Infinitive Verb`
    - Example: _Which horse did Sherlock find in Capleton Stables?_
        - Question word: _Which horse_
        - Auxiliary verb: _did_
        - Subject: _Sherlock_
        - Infinitive verb: _find_

#### **Key Lesson 3: Auxiliary Verbs and Inversion**

- When auxiliary verbs are used, **subject-auxiliary inversion** occurs:
    - Normal Sentence: _John Straker did buy a new dress._
    - Inversion (Question): _Did John Straker buy a new dress?_
- Examples of inversion:
    - Did they…?
    - Can I…?
    - Would he…?

**Summary of Object Questions**:

- Use auxiliary verbs (`do`, `does`, `did`) when the question word is **not the subject**.
- Follow the structure: `Question Word` → `Auxiliary Verb` → `Subject` → `Infinitive Verb`.

#### **Side Lesson 1: Subject vs. Object**

- **Subject**: The "doer" of the verb.
- **Object**: The one the action is done to.
    - Example: _He bought a new dress._
        - Subject: _He_
        - Object: _a new dress_

---

#### **Side Lesson 2: The Use of “Whom”**

- _Who_ = Subject
- _Whom_ = Object
    - Correct: _Whom did John Straker buy a dress for?_
    - Reality: Most native speakers use **"Who"** instead of "Whom".
    - Schools may still teach "whom" formally, but it’s rarely used in spoken English.

#### **Examples to Remember:**

1. _Who did John Straker buy a new dress for?_ (Correct, natural)
2. _Whom did John Straker buy a new dress for?_ (Technically correct but rarely used).
3. _Which horse did Sherlock find in the stables?_
4. _How many horses did they watch in the race?_
