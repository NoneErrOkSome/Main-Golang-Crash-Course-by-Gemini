### **Key Lesson 4: Questions Without Auxiliary Verbs**

1. **When the question word is the subject of the sentence**, you do **not** use auxiliary verbs (`do`, `does`, `did`).
    
2. **Examples**:
    
    - _Who killed John Straker?_
        - **Subject**: _Who_
        - **Answer**: Fitzroy Simpson killed John Straker.
        - Explanation: _"Who"_ is the subject of the verb _killed_. No auxiliary verb is needed.
    - _Which horse won the Wessex Cup?_
        - **Subject**: _Which horse_
        - **Answer**: Desborough won the Wessex Cup.
    - _How many horses ran in the race?_
        - **Subject**: _How many horses_
        - **Answer**: Six horses ran in the race.

### **Key Lesson 5: Comparing Subject and Object Questions**

1. **Object Question** _(requires auxiliary verbs)_:
    
    - _How many horses did they watch in the race?_
        - Question word: _How many horses_ (object of "watch")
        - Auxiliary: _did_
        - Subject: _they_
        - Infinitive: _watch_
    - **Answer**: They watched six horses.
2. **Subject Question** _(no auxiliary verbs)_:
    
    - _How many horses ran in the race?_
        - Question word: _How many horses_ (subject of "ran").
    - **Answer**: Six horses ran in the race.

### **Key Lesson 6: Patterns for Subject Questions**

- Subject questions typically occur with:
    
    1. **Who**
    2. **Which + noun**
    3. **How many + noun**
- You do not use `do`, `does`, or `did` with these.
    
    **Examples**:
    
    - _Who found the Silver Blaze?_ → Sherlock Holmes found the Silver Blaze.
    - _Which student answered the question?_ → Tom answered the question.
    - _How many people came to the meeting?_ → Ten people came to the meeting.

### **Side Lesson 3: When Do We Always Use Auxiliary Verbs?**

- Certain question words **always** require auxiliary verbs:
    - **What**
    - **Why**
    - **When**

**Examples**:

- _What did John Straker do?_
- _Why did John Straker take the horse outside?_
- _When did he wake up?_

You will **always** see auxiliary verbs with these question words because they do not act as the subject.

### **Side Lesson 4: Simplicity of Subject Questions**

- **Subject questions** are simpler because there is no subject-auxiliary inversion.
    
    - Example (Object Question): _Who did Sherlock find in the stables?_
    - Example (Subject Question): _Who found the horse?_
- In subject questions, the question word (_Who_, _Which_, _How many_) **is** the subject.
