### Part 4/5: Using "To + Infinitive" After Adjectives and to Explain Purpose

1. **Infinitives After Adjectives:**
    
    - Use "to + infinitive" after adjectives to provide more information or describe a situation.
    - **Examples:**
        - "It’s difficult **to pass** this exam."
        - "It was nice **to meet** you."
        - "I’m glad **to help** you."
        - "These suitcases are too heavy **to carry**."
2. **Infinitives to Explain Purpose:**
    
    - Use "to + infinitive" to explain the reason for an action.
    - **Examples:**
        - "I went to the shops **to buy** milk and bread."
        - "I bought this course **to learn** English quickly."
        - "They worked overtime **to finish** the project."
3. **Common Adjective + Infinitive Combinations:**
    
    - **Too + adjective + infinitive:**
        - "It’s too cold **to swim** today."
    - **Adjective + infinitive:**
        - "She is happy **to help** with your homework."
        - "He was surprised **to hear** the news."
4. **Using Infinitives to Replace Purpose Clauses:**
    
    - Instead of using a full clause, the infinitive provides a concise explanation.
    - **Example:**
        - Full clause: "I went to the library so that I could study."
        - Infinitive: "I went to the library **to study**."
