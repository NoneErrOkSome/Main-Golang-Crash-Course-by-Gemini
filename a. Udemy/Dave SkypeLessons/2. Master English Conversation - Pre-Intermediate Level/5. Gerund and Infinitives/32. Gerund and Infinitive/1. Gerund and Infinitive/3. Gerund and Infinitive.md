### Part 3/5: Using Gerunds as Subjects and for Comparisons

1. **Gerunds as Subjects:**
    
    - When a verb acts as the subject of a sentence, it must be in gerund form.
    - **Examples:**
        - "Smoking is bad for your health."
        - "Arriving early was a bad idea because our flight was delayed."
        - "Cooking at home is healthier than eating out."
2. **Comparing Actions with Gerunds:**
    
    - When comparing two actions, gerunds are used for both actions.
    - **Examples:**
        - "Cooking at home is healthier than eating at a restaurant."
        - "Learning English is more useful than studying another subject right now."
3. **Key Points About Gerunds as Subjects:**
    
    - Gerunds describe the "doer" or the "action" in a sentence.
    - They can make the sentence concise while focusing on the action itself.
4. **Additional Example Sentences:**
    
    - "Exercising regularly keeps you fit."
    - "Reading before bed helps me sleep."
    - "Practicing speaking improves your fluency."
