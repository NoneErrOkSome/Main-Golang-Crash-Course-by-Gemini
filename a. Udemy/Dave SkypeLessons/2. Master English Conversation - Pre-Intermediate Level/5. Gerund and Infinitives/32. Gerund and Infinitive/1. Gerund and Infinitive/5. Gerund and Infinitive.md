### Part 5/5: Flexibility of Gerunds and Infinitives

1. **Verbs That Can Take Both Gerunds and Infinitives:**
    
    - Some verbs can be followed by either a gerund or an infinitive, sometimes with a change in meaning.
    - **Examples:**
        - "I started **learning** English."
        - "I started **to learn** English."
        - Both sentences mean the same in this case.
2. **Verbs That Change Meaning Depending on Form:**
    
    - Some verbs have different meanings when followed by a gerund versus an infinitive.
    - **Examples:**
        - **"Stop"**:
            - "He stopped **smoking**." (He quit smoking entirely.)
            - "He stopped **to smoke**." (He paused an activity to smoke.)
        - **"Remember"**:
            - "I remember **meeting** her." (A memory of the past.)
            - "Remember **to meet** her." (A reminder for the future.)
3. **Infinitives with Adjective Expressions:**
    
    - Infinitives are often used after adjectives in expressions that convey opinions, feelings, or assessments.
    - **Examples:**
        - "Itâ€™s important **to practice** speaking every day."
        - "He was excited **to travel** to Greece."
        - "She found it hard **to concentrate** in the noisy room."
4. **Purpose and Flexibility:**
    
    - Use infinitives to explain the reason for actions or plans:
        - "I took this course **to improve** my grammar."
        - "They left early **to catch** the train."
    - Use gerunds to focus on the action itself, especially in descriptive or habitual contexts:
        - "Running helps reduce stress."
        - "Learning a new language requires dedication."
5. **Key Verbs and Structures to Practice:**
    
    - **Gerund-focused verbs:** enjoy, avoid, keep, finish, stop.
    - **Infinitive-focused verbs:** want, decide, choose, agree, plan.
    - **Flexible verbs:** start, continue, remember, stop.
