### Part 2/5: Using Gerunds After Prepositions and Phrasal Verbs

1. **Gerunds After Prepositions:**
    
    - Gerunds are always used after prepositions (e.g., "at," "in," "on," "about").
    - **Examples:**
        - "I’m good at **remembering** people’s names."
        - "She is afraid of **flying**."
        - "I’m thinking about **spending** my summer in Greece."
2. **Gerunds After Phrasal Verbs:**
    
    - Phrasal verbs (a verb + a preposition) must also be followed by a gerund when a verb is used.
    - **Examples:**
        - "He gave up **smoking** last year." (phrasal verb: "give up")
        - "She keeps on **working** hard." (phrasal verb: "keep on")
        - "I look forward to **hearing** from you." (phrasal verb: "look forward to")
3. **Common Prepositions and Gerunds:**
    
    - **Good/Bad at:** "I’m bad at **drawing**."
    - **Afraid of:** "I’ve always been afraid of **heights**."
    - **Thinking about:** "I’m thinking about **learning** Spanish."
4. **Important Note About "To":**
    
    - In phrases like "look forward to," the "to" is a preposition, not part of an infinitive.
        - Correct: "I look forward to **meeting** you."
        - Incorrect: "I look forward to **meet** you."
