### Part 1/5: Introduction to Gerunds and Infinitives

1. **What Are Gerunds and Infinitives?**
    
    - **Gerunds:** Verbs with an **-ing** ending that act like nouns (e.g., "playing," "swimming").
    - **Infinitives:** The base form of a verb preceded by "to" (e.g., "to play," "to swim").
2. **Why Are They Important?**
    
    - Gerunds and infinitives are used in many everyday sentences, making them as significant as tenses.
    - They often appear after verbs:
        - Gerund example: "I enjoy **playing** football."
        - Infinitive example: "I want **to play** football."
3. **Modal Verbs and Infinitives:**
    
    - Modal verbs (e.g., "can," "should," "must") are always followed by the bare infinitive, without "to."
        - Correct: "I must **go**."
        - Incorrect: "I must **to go**."
4. **Examples of Verbs Followed by Infinitives:**
    
    - Common verbs that take "to + infinitive":
        - "I want **to study** English."
        - "She decided **to learn** French."
        - "He agreed **to help** his friend."
5. **Two Special Exceptions (Let and Make):**
    
    - **"Let"** means to allow someone to do something and is followed by the bare infinitive:
        - Example: "I let my daughter **go** abroad alone."
    - **"Make"** means to force someone to do something and is also followed by the bare infinitive:
        - Example: "I made the children **do** their homework."
