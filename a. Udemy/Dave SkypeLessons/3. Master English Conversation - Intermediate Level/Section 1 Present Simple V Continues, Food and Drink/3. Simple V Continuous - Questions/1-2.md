### 1/10: **Introduction to Preferences and Present Simple**

The instructor begins by emphasizing that the verb **"prefer"** is not used in the continuous tense. It is always in the **present simple** form. For example:

The key points include:

1. Always use the **infinitive** form after "do" or "does":
    
    - **Do you prefer**
    - **Does he prefer**
2. Example sentences:
    
    - "Do you prefer eating at home or eating out?"
    - "Does he prefer eating at home or eating out?"
