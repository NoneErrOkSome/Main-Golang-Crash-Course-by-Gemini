### Stative Verbs: Special Rules and Exceptions

#### **What Are Stative Verbs?**

Stative verbs describe a state or condition rather than an action. These verbs are rarely used in the continuous form because they express **facts**, **opinions**, or **states of mind** that do not change frequently.

#### **Categories of Stative Verbs**:

1. **Emotions and Preferences**:
    
    - Verbs: **Like**, **love**, **hate**, **prefer**, **need**, **want**.
    - Example:
        - Correct: I **like** pizza.
        - Incorrect: I **am liking** pizza.
2. **Mental States**:
    
    - Verbs: **Know**, **understand**, **believe**, **remember**, **realize**, **recognize**, **suppose**.
    - Example:
        - Correct: I **know** the answer.
        - Incorrect: I **am knowing** the answer.
3. **Senses and Perception**:
    
    - Verbs: **See**, **hear**, **smell**, **taste**, **seem**, **appear**.
    - Example:
        - Correct: The soup **smells** delicious.
        - Incorrect: The soup **is smelling** delicious.

#### **Exceptions for Stative Verbs**:

Some stative verbs can take on an action meaning in specific contexts, allowing them to be used in the continuous form:

- **Think**:
    
    - Stative: I **think** he is smart. (Opinion)
    - Action: I **am thinking** about the problem. (Process)
- **Have**:
    
    - Stative: I **have** a dog. (Possession)
    - Action: I **am having** lunch. (Action in progress)
