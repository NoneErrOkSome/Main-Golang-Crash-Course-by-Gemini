### Forming Questions in Present Simple and Present Continuous

#### **Present Simple Questions**:

- **Structure**: **Do/Does** + Subject + Base Verb?
- **Key Rule**: Use **does** for third-person singular (he, she, it) and **do** for all others.
- **Examples**:
    - **Do** you **like** pizza?
    - **Does** she **work** on Mondays?
    - **Do** they **play** football every weekend?

#### **Common Mistakes**:

- Incorrect: **Does she likes** pizza?
- Correct: **Does she like** pizza? (No **-s** with "like" because "does" already shows third-person singular.)

---

#### **Present Continuous Questions**:

- **Structure**: **Am/Is/Are** + Subject + Verb(-ing)?
- **Key Rule**: Use the correct form of **be** (am, is, are) based on the subject.
- **Examples**:
    - **Are** you **watching** TV now?
    - **Is** he **working** on his project?
    - **Am** I **speaking** too fast?

#### **Comparison of Questions**:

1. Present Simple:
    - Habitual: **Do** they **study** English every day?
2. Present Continuous:
    - Ongoing: **Are** they **studying** English right now?

### Common Errors with Present Simple and Present Continuous

#### **1. Using the Wrong Verb Form for Stative Verbs**

- **Error**: Using stative verbs in continuous form.
    - Incorrect: I **am knowing** the answer.
    - Correct: I **know** the answer.
- **Tip**: Stative verbs like **know**, **believe**, **like**, and **want** are not used in continuous tenses.

#### **2. Confusing Habitual and Temporary Actions**

- **Error**: Using present simple for temporary actions.
    - Incorrect: She **walks** to school today.
    - Correct: She **is walking** to school today.
- **Tip**: Use present continuous for actions happening temporarily or now.

#### **3. Forgetting the "S" in Third-Person Singular (Present Simple)**

- **Error**: Omitting the "s" for third-person singular subjects.
    - Incorrect: He **play** football every day.
    - Correct: He **plays** football every day.
- **Tip**: Add **-s** or **-es** for third-person singular verbs in present simple.

#### **4. Using Present Continuous for Scheduled Events**

- **Error**: Using present continuous for fixed schedules.
    - Incorrect: The train **is arriving** at 8:00 p.m. tonight.
    - Correct: The train **arrives** at 8:00 p.m. tonight.
- **Tip**: Use present simple for scheduled events, even if they are in the future.
