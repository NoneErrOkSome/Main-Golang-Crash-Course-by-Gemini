### **3/30: Exceptions for "Make" in Chores**

While "do" is commonly used for chores and household tasks, there are a few exceptions where we use **"make"** instead. These exceptions occur because the focus shifts to the **result** of the action rather than the process.

#### Key Exception:

- **Make the bed**:
    - This means arranging the bed after sleeping, making it look neat and tidy. The focus is on the outcome â€” the bed looks clean and well-made.

#### Why This is an Exception:

Unlike other household tasks, where the emphasis is on the action (e.g., _do the laundry_), **making the bed** creates a visible result, which aligns with the meaning of "make."

### Summary for Chores:

- Use **"do"** for most chores: _do the cleaning, do the ironing._
- Use **"make"** only when the focus is on creating or arranging something: _make the bed._

Let me know if this makes sense before moving to **4/30: "Do" for Personal Grooming and Actions**.

### **4/30: "Do" for Personal Grooming and Actions**

The word **"do"** is also used for personal grooming activities and other routine actions. In these cases, the focus is on the action being performed rather than creating a result.

#### Common Collocations with "Do":

    - _Do your hair_: Styling your hair to make it look nice.
        
    - _Do your nails_: Painting or caring for your nails.
        
    - _Do your makeup_: Applying cosmetics.
        
    
    > Example:  
    > "She always **does her makeup** before going out."
    
2. **Helping Others:**
    
    - _Do somebody a favor_: Helping someone by fulfilling their request.  
        Example: _Can you **do me a favor** and lend me your pen?_

### Why "Do" is Used:

In these situations, **"do"** emphasizes the **effort or activity** of grooming or helping, rather than the outcome. For instance:

- When you _do your hair_, the focus is on the process of working on your hairstyle.
