### **1/30: Introduction to "Do" and "Make"**

The words **"do"** and **"make"** are often confusing for English learners, but understanding their general differences can help you use them correctly. Here's the core idea:

- **"Do"** focuses on the **action** itself.
- **"Make"** focuses on the **result** or **outcome** of an action.

#### Examples:

1. "When I was **doing** the calculation, I **made** a mistake."
    - **Do**: The activity of working on the calculation.
    - **Make**: The error is the result of that activity.

We will explore specific collocations (common word pairings) for both "do" and "make" to understand their correct usage.

#### Key Difference:

- Use **"do"** for actions, activities, or tasks where the process is important:
    - _do homework, do housework, do the laundry._
- Use **"make"** for creating or producing something:
    - _make a cake, make a promise, make an effort._

This distinction will become clearer as we explore examples related to work, daily chores, communication, and more.
