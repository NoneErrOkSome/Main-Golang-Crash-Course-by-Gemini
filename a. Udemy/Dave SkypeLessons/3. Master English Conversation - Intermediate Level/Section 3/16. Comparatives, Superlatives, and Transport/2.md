### Part 2: **Two-Syllable Adjectives**

#### Adjectives Ending in "-y"

For adjectives with two syllables that end in **-y** (e.g., _spicy_, _funny_, _happy_, _pretty_):

- To form the **comparative**, replace **-y** with **-ier**.
    - Example: _spicy_ → _spicier_.
    - Sentence: _Indian cuisine is spicier than English cuisine._
- To form the **superlative**, replace **-y** with **-iest**.
    - Example: _spicy_ → _the spiciest_.
    - Sentence: _Indian cuisine is the spiciest in the world._

#### Key Examples:

1. **Spicy**
    
    - Comparative: _spicier_.
        - Sentence: _This curry is spicier than the one we had yesterday._
    - Superlative: _the spiciest_.
        - Sentence: _This is the spiciest curry I’ve ever tried._
2. **Happy**
    
    - Comparative: _happier_.
        - Sentence: _She looks happier than before._
    - Superlative: _the happiest_.
        - Sentence: _Today is the happiest day of my life._

#### Adjectives with Two Syllables (Not Ending in "-y")

For two-syllable adjectives that do not end in **-y** (e.g., _generous_, _boring_, _expensive_):

- Use **"more"** to form the **comparative**.
    - Example: _generous_ → _more generous_.
    - Sentence: _My uncle is more generous than my father._
- Use **"the most"** to form the **superlative**.
    - Example: _generous_ → _the most generous_.
    - Sentence: _He is the most generous man I know._

#### Explanation of "Generous"

- _Generous_ describes someone who enjoys giving to others, often through gifts or help.
    - Sentence: _She is generous with her time and often helps others._

#### Common Errors to Avoid:

1. Trying to add **-er** or **-est** to long adjectives.
    - Incorrect: _generouser_ or _boringer_.
    - Correct: _more generous_, _more boring_.
2. Forgetting to use **"more"** and **"the most"** for long adjectives.
    - Incorrect: _He is generous than her._
    - Correct: _He is more generous than her._

#### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between two-syllable adjectives ending in **-y** and those that do not. For example, while _spicy_ changes to _spicier_, a word like _boring_ requires _more boring_. They highlight the word _generous_ as a good example of how English uses "more" and "most" with longer adjectives.
