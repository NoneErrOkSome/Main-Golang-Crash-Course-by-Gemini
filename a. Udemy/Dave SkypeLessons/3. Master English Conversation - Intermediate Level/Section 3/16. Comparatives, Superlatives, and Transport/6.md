### Part 6: **Typical Mistakes and Corrections**

#### Common Mistakes in Comparatives and Superlatives

1. **Using "as" Instead of "than" in Comparatives**:
    
    - **Incorrect**: _Traveling by train is far more expensive as traveling by bus._
    - **Correct**: _Traveling by train is far more expensive than traveling by bus._
    - Explanation: Comparatives require "than" to indicate comparison.
2. **Forgetting "the" with Superlatives**:
    
    - **Incorrect**: _Stockholm is most expensive city I was in._
    - **Correct**: _Stockholm is the most expensive city I have ever been to._
    - Explanation: Superlatives always require the article "the."
3. **Misusing Adverbs in Comparatives**:
    
    - **Incorrect**: _My sister drives slowly than my aunt._
    - **Correct**: _My sister drives more slowly than my aunt._
    - Explanation: For adverbs (e.g., _slowly_), use "more" instead of adding "-er."
4. **Misusing "same" Comparisons**:
    
    - **Incorrect**: _Your bike is the same color than mine._
    - **Correct**: _Your bike is the same color as mine._
    - Explanation: "Same" comparisons require "as" instead of "than."
5. **Errors with Short Adjectives in Comparatives**:
    
    - **Incorrect**: _Lorries are more big than vans, coaches, and buses._
    - **Correct**: _Lorries are bigger than vans, coaches, and buses._
    - Explanation: Short adjectives like "big" follow the "-er" rule, not "more."
6. **Incorrect Use of Irregular Forms**:
    
    - **Incorrect**: _Traveling long distance by car is worser than traveling by plane._
    - **Correct**: _Traveling long distance by car is worse than traveling by plane._
    - Explanation: Irregular forms like _bad → worse → the worst_ must be memorized.

#### Noun Countability Errors

1. **Confusion Between Countable and Uncountable Nouns**:
    - **Incorrect**: _Our luggages were heavier than we thought._

#### Key Grammar Points:

1. **Comparatives Need "Than"**:
    
    - Always use "than" to connect the items being compared.
    - Example: _The new bus route is faster than the old one._
2. **Superlatives Need "the"**:
    
    - Use "the" before superlative forms.
    - Example: _This is the worst traffic jam I’ve ever seen._
3. **Countable vs. Uncountable Nouns**:
    
    - _Luggage_ and _baggage_ are uncountable: _too much luggage_.
    - _Suitcase_ is countable: _two suitcases_.

#### Lecturer’s Personal Tips:

- Special focus is placed on irregular forms like "worse" and correcting overgeneralizations such as "worser" or "more big."
