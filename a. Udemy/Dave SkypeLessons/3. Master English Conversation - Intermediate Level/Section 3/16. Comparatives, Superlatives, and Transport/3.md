### Part 3: **Equality and Inequality**

#### Expressing Equality

To compare two things that are **equal** in some way, use the structure:

- **as + adjective + as**
    - Example: _The bus is as fast as the tube._
    - Sentence: _Traveling by train is as comfortable as traveling by plane._

**Key Examples**:

1. **Speed Comparison**:
    - _The bus is as fast as the tube._
        - Meaning: Both modes of transport take the same time.
2. **Price Comparison**:
    - _Traveling by plane is as cheap as traveling by train._
        - Meaning: Both cost the same.

#### Expressing Inequality

To show that two things are **not equal**, simply add **not** before the first "as":

- **not as + adjective + as**
    - Example: _White bread is not as fresh as brown bread._
    - Sentence: _The train is not as convenient as the bus._

**Key Examples**:

1. **Freshness Comparison**:
    - _White bread is not as fresh as brown bread._
        - Meaning: Brown bread is fresher than white bread.
    - Synonym: _Brown bread is fresher than white bread._
2. **Safety Comparison**:
    - _Driving in my country is not as safe as driving in other countries._
        - Meaning: Driving in other countries is safer.

#### Using Synonymous Structures

Both forms of comparison often express the same idea:

1. _White bread is not as fresh as brown bread._
2. _Brown bread is fresher than white bread._

#### Tips from the Lecturer:

- This structure is versatile and works for both positive and negative comparisons.
- Be mindful of using **"as"** instead of **"than"** in these cases, as **"than"** is reserved for direct comparatives (e.g., _fresher than_).

#### Examples in Context:

1. **Travel**:
    - _Traveling by bus is as convenient as traveling by car._
    - _Traveling by train is not as fast as traveling by plane._
2. **Food**:
    - _This curry is as spicy as the one we had last week._
    - _The fruit is not as fresh as I expected._

#### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer illustrates the importance of these structures using practical examples, such as comparing public transport options (_the bus is as fast as the tube_). They also emphasize how **"not as + adjective + as"** provides an alternative way to express comparisons, often with simpler language.
