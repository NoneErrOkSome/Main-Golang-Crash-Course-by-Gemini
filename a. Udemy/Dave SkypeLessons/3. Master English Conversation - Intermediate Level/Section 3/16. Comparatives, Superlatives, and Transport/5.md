#### Example Questions for Comparatives

1. **Speed and Traffic**:
    
    - _What is the fastest speed you have driven at?_
        - Emphasizes the use of the superlative (_the fastest_).
    - _Have you ever exceeded the speed limit?_
        - Reinforces the concept of breaking traffic rules by going faster than allowed.
2. **Driving and Parking**:
    
    - _Have you ever forgotten where you parked your car?_
        - Encourages using experiences to discuss comparatives, e.g., _I forgot my parking spot more often in busy areas than in quiet places._
    - _Is driving in your country safer than in other countries?_
        - Focuses on the comparative (_safer than_).
3. **Fuel Costs**:
    
    - _Is petrol in your country more expensive than in Europe?_
        - Highlights the use of _more + adjective + than_ for comparisons involving longer adjectives like _expensive_.

1. **Convenience**:

#### Lecturer’s Personal Anecdotes

The lecturer shares personal experiences to make the practice relatable:

- They describe getting stuck in Moscow traffic, which is often heavier than in other cities in Europe.
- They share a story about forgetting a parked car’s location and the struggles of finding enough car parks in urban areas.
- Anecdotes about crashes highlight the use of comparatives (e.g., _safer than_).

#### Cultural Insights

- _Driving in the UK_: Speed limits on motorways are typically 70mph, and fines for speeding are common, often enforced by speed cameras.
- _Cycling Culture_: Amsterdam is noted for having many cycle lanes, which contrasts with UK cities, where cycling infrastructure is less developed.
