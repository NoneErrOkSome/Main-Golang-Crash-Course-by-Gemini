### Part 1: **Overview of Comparatives and Superlatives**

#### Definition and General Rules

Comparatives and superlatives are used to compare things or describe the highest or lowest degree of a quality. Comparatives are used when comparing two items, and superlatives are used when describing one item as having the highest degree of a quality among a group.

#### One-Syllable Adjectives

For adjectives with one syllable (e.g., _big_, _small_, _short_, _long_):

- To form the **comparative**, add **-er** to the end of the adjective.
    - Example: _big_ → _bigger_.
- To form the **superlative**, add **-est** to the end of the adjective.
    - Example: _big_ → _the biggest_.

#### Key Points to Remember:

1. Always use **"than"** with comparatives.
    - Example: _The white bread is fresher than the brown bread_.
2. Always use **"the"** before superlatives.
    - Example: _This is the freshest bread in the shop_.

#### Examples with "Fresh"

- **Comparative**: _fresher_.
    - Sentence: _This bread is fresher than yesterday’s bread._
- **Superlative**: _the freshest_.
    - Sentence: _This is the freshest bread I’ve ever had._

#### Explanation of "Fresh"

- _Fresh_ means something new or recently prepared. For example:
    - _Fresh bread_ is usually warm and smells nice.
    - _Fresh air_ refers to clean, pure air.

#### Common Errors to Avoid:

- Forgetting **"than"** after comparatives.
    - Incorrect: _This bread is fresher._
    - Correct: _This bread is fresher than yesterday's bread._
- Forgetting **"the"** before superlatives.
    - Incorrect: _This is freshest bread._
    - Correct: _This is the freshest bread._

#### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer emphasizes the simplicity of English comparatives and superlatives, especially with short adjectives. They suggest focusing on remembering the rules for adding **-er** and **-est**, as well as the proper use of "than" and "the." The example of "fresh bread" is highlighted because it’s a relatable context for learners.
