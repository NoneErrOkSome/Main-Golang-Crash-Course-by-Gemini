### **Part 7: Personal Experiences (Have You Ever...)**

---

The lecturer introduces the question structure **"Have you ever..."** to explore life experiences. This structure is commonly used with the **Present Perfect tense** to discuss **unfinished periods**, specifically referring to one’s lifetime.
