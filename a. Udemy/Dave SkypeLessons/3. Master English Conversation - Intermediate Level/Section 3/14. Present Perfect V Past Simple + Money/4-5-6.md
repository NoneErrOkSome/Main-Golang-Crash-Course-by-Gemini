### **Part 4: Key Signal Words for Past Simple**

---

The lecturer explains that **Past Simple** is used to describe **finished actions or moments** that are disconnected from the present. Signal words help identify when to use this tense, making it easier to distinguish from Present Perfect.

---

#### **1. Ago**

- **Definition**: Refers to a specific point in the past, counted backward from now.
- **Usage**:
    - _I went to Paris three years ago._
    - _She left the company two months ago._
- **Explanation**: "Ago" clearly indicates that the action occurred in the past and is finished.
- **Example from the transcript**:
    - _I haven’t used that since I bought it one year ago._

---

#### **2. When**

- **Definition**: Used to ask or describe a specific moment in the past.
- **Usage**:
    - _When did you arrive?_
    - _I moved to this city when I was 18._
- **Explanation**: "When" refers to a finished moment in the past, so it must be followed by Past Simple.
- **Important Note from the Lecturer**:
    - _When_ cannot be used with Present Perfect unless referring to the future (e.g., _When I have finished my exams, I will go to university_).
    - _Incorrect_: _When have you finished your homework?_
    - _Correct_: _When did you finish your homework?_

---

#### **3. At [specific time]**

- **Definition**: Refers to a specific, exact time when an action happened.
- **Usage**:
    - _I woke up at 7:00 AM._
    - _We arrived at 3:30 PM._
- **Example from the transcript**:
    - _I broke my leg at 3:30._

---

#### **4. On [day or date]**

- **Definition**: Refers to specific days of the week or specific calendar dates.
- **Usage**:
    - _I met her on Monday._
    - _They moved here on January 1st._
- **Example from the transcript**:
    - _I met her on Monday._

---

#### **5. In [year, month, season]**

- **Definition**: Refers to periods that are complete, such as specific years, months, or seasons.
- **Usage**:
    - _He was born in 1990._
    - _We visited Spain in June._
    - _They got married in winter._
- **Explanation**: These time markers indicate that the period is finished and disconnected from the present.
- **Example from the transcript**:
    - _They lived in that house in 2001._

---

#### **6. Last [week, year, month, etc.]**

- **Definition**: Refers to the most recent completed time frame.
- **Usage**:
    - _I went to Paris last year._
    - _She called me last night._
- **Example from the transcript**:
    - _I sold my computer last month._

---

#### **7. Specific Periods in the Past**

- **Definition**: Refers to clearly defined past periods that are finished.
- **Usage**:
    - _In the 1990s, they traveled a lot._
    - _During the summer, we went camping every weekend._
- **Explanation**: These time frames are fully in the past and require Past Simple.
- **Example from the transcript**:
    - _My parents had a mortgage for 25 years._

---

### **Comparison with Present Perfect**

The lecturer highlights how these signal words differ from Present Perfect markers. For example:

- **Past Simple**: _I lived there for three years._ (A finished period in the past.)
- **Present Perfect**: _I have lived here for three years._ (An unfinished period connected to the present.)

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Past Simple Signal Words** clearly define finished periods of time (_ago, when, at, on, in, last_).
2. Use Past Simple when referring to specific moments or periods in the past that are completed and not connected to the present.

 ### **Part 5: Unfinished vs. Finished Periods**

---

The lecturer explains the critical distinction between **unfinished periods** (requiring Present Perfect) and **finished periods** (requiring Past Simple). This distinction helps learners decide which tense to use in different contexts.

---

#### **1. Unfinished Periods (Present Perfect)**

- **Definition**: A period of time that began in the past and continues into the present or is still ongoing.
    
- **Examples of Unfinished Periods**:
    
    - **This week**: _I have worked hard this week._ (The week is still ongoing.)
    - **Today**: _I have had three meetings today._ (The day isn’t over.)
    - **This year**: _Sales have increased this year._ (The year is not finished.)
    - **Since 2020**: _I have lived here since 2020._ (The action started in 2020 and continues.)
    - **For three years**: _I have lived here for three years._ (Three years have passed, but the action is ongoing.)
- **Philosophy of Unfinished Periods**:  
    Present Perfect focuses on actions or events that belong to a **time frame that is still active or relevant**. The lecturer stresses that this is why Present Perfect is used with signal words like _today, this week, since,_ and _for_.
    
- **Key Examples from the Transcript**:
    
    - _I have had a mortgage for five years._ (The mortgage is ongoing.)
    - _I have never been to Greece._ (Referring to one’s life, which is still ongoing.)
    - _Sales have increased this year._ (2023 is not over yet.)

---

#### **2. Finished Periods (Past Simple)**

- **Definition**: A period of time that is completed and disconnected from the present.
    
- **Examples of Finished Periods**:
    
    - **Last week**: _I worked hard last week._ (The week is over.)
    - **Yesterday**: _I had three meetings yesterday._ (The day is finished.)
    - **In 2020**: _I moved here in 2020._ (2020 is in the past and not ongoing.)
    - **For five years (but finished)**: _I lived there for five years._ (The five years are complete and do not connect to the present.)
- **Philosophy of Finished Periods**:  
    Past Simple focuses on actions or events that are part of a **time frame that has ended**. The lecturer emphasizes that these actions are complete, and the time frame does not extend into the present.
    
- **Key Examples from the Transcript**:
    
    - _My parents had a mortgage for 25 years._ (They paid it off; the mortgage is finished.)
    - _I sold my computer last month._ (The action is complete, and "last month" is a finished time frame.)
    - _I met her on Monday._ (Monday is over, and the action is in the past.)

---

#### **3. Comparison Between Unfinished and Finished Periods**

- **Present Perfect** (Unfinished Period):
    
    - _I have been married for five years._ (The marriage is ongoing.)
    - _I have had a student loan for 23 years._ (The loan still exists.)
- **Past Simple** (Finished Period):
    
    - _They were married for five years._ (They are no longer married.)
    - _I had a student loan for five years._ (The loan has been paid off.)

---

#### **4. Signal Words That Indicate Unfinished vs. Finished Periods**

|**Unfinished Periods (Present Perfect)**|**Finished Periods (Past Simple)**|
|---|---|
|Today, this week/month/year|Yesterday, last week/month/year|
|For (ongoing)|For (finished)|
|Since (starting point to now)|Ago|
|Ever/never (life experiences)|Specific past times (e.g., in 2001, on Monday)|

---

#### **5. Practical Examples**

The lecturer provides examples to illustrate the differences:

- **Unfinished Period**:
    - _I have lived here since 2020._  
        (The time period is ongoing, connecting to the present.)
- **Finished Period**:
    - _I lived there in 2020._  
        (The time period is complete and in the past.)

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Unfinished Periods** use Present Perfect because they connect the past to the present.
2. **Finished Periods** use Past Simple because they are entirely in the past.
3. Focus on the signal words to decide which tense to use.
