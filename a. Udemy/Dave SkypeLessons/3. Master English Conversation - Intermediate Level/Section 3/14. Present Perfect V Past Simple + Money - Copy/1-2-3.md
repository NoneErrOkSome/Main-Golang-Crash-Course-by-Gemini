### **Part 1: Introduction to the Lesson**

---

**Purpose of the Lesson:** The lecturer introduces this class as a focus on two main topics:

1. **Grammar**: The distinction between the **Present Perfect** and **Past Simple** tenses, which often confuses students at the intermediate level.
2. **Vocabulary**: Key financial terms and phrasal verbs related to **money**, which are essential for everyday communication and understanding economic discussions.

---

**Structure of the Lesson:**

- The lecture is divided into two key areas:
    - **Grammar Explanation**: Clarifying when and how to use Present Perfect and Past Simple.
    - **Practical Vocabulary**: Introducing and explaining money-related vocabulary and their usage in real-life contexts.

The lecturer emphasizes that understanding these topics will help students:

- Speak more naturally about personal experiences, financial matters, and everyday activities.
- Use tenses appropriately based on context, such as unfinished vs. finished periods.

---

**Initial Grammar Concepts:**

- **Present Perfect**:
    
    - Structure: _Have/has + third form (past participle)_.
    - Example: _I have known him for three years._
    - Highlight: Present Perfect involves two words and focuses on **unfinished periods** or actions relevant to the present.
- **Past Simple**:
    
    - Structure: _Second form of the verb_ (e.g., _played, went_).
    - Example: _I knew him in 2001._
    - Highlight: Past Simple typically involves one word (except in questions, where _did_ is used).
- **Quick Review of Irregular Verbs**:
    
    - Example: _Know → Knew → Known._
    - Present Perfect: _Have known._
    - Past Simple: _Knew._

---

**Focus on Questions in Past Simple:** The lecturer reminds students:

- In Past Simple questions, the auxiliary _did_ is used with the **infinitive** form of the verb.
    - Correct: _Did you go?_ or _Did you play?_
    - Incorrect: _Did you went?_ (_"Rubbish," as the lecturer puts it humorously._)

---

**Why This Lesson Matters:** The lecturer stresses that understanding these tenses is essential because:

- Present Perfect is used for **unfinished periods** connected to the present.
- Past Simple is used for **finished moments or actions** in the past.
- Many students confuse these tenses due to subtle differences in usage.

### **Part 2: Grammar Overview**

---

**Present Perfect**  
The lecturer provides an in-depth explanation of the Present Perfect tense, emphasizing its structure, usage, and key concepts.

- **Definition**:  
    Present Perfect is used to describe:
    
    1. Actions or events that happened in the past but are still relevant to the present.
    2. Unfinished periods of time that connect the past to the present.
- **Structure**:  
    _Have/has + past participle (third form)_ of the verb.  
    Example: _I have worked here for three years._
    
- **Signal Words**:  
    Present Perfect is often accompanied by certain words or phrases that signal its usage. These include:
    
    - _Yet_: _I haven’t finished yet._
    - _Already_: _I have already eaten breakfast._
    - _Just_: _I’ve just finished my homework._
    - _For_: _I have lived here for five years._
    - _Since_: _I have lived here since 2018._
    - _Ever_: _Have you ever been to Paris?_
    - _Never_: _I have never seen that movie._
    - _How long_: _How long have you been married?_
    - _This week/month/year_: _Sales have increased this year._
- **Key Concept**:  
    Present Perfect focuses on **unfinished periods** of time.
    
    - Example: _I have lived here for three years._
        - "For three years" indicates an unfinished period connecting the past to the present.
- **Unfinished Periods**:  
    Examples of unfinished periods are words like _today, this week, this month, this year_. These refer to time frames that are still ongoing.
    
    - Example: _What have you done today?_  
        (The day is still ongoing.)

---

**Past Simple**  
The lecturer contrasts Present Perfect with Past Simple by explaining its definition, structure, and usage.

- **Definition**:  
    Past Simple is used to describe actions or events that are entirely **finished** in the past and disconnected from the present.
    
- **Structure**:  
    _Verb in the past tense (second form)_  
    Example: _I worked there for three years._
    
- **Signal Words**:  
    Past Simple is often accompanied by signal words that indicate finished periods. These include:
    
    - _Ago_: _I went to Paris three years ago._
    - _When_: _I went there when I was 18._
    - _At [specific time]_: _I woke up at 7 AM._
    - _On [day]_: _I met her on Monday._
    - _In [month/year]_: _I moved here in 2020._
- **Key Concept**:  
    Past Simple focuses on **finished moments or actions**.
    
    - Example: _I lived there for three years._
        - This indicates that the action is entirely in the past and does not connect to the present.
- **Finished Periods**:  
    Examples of finished periods are words like _last week, last year, in January, on Monday_. These refer to time frames that have ended.
    
    - Example: _What did you do yesterday?_  
        (The day is over.)

---

**Comparison Between Present Perfect and Past Simple**  
The lecturer highlights the main difference between these two tenses:

- Present Perfect: Used for **unfinished periods** or past events with present relevance.
    - Example: _I have seen that movie._ (The experience is still relevant.)
- Past Simple: Used for **finished periods** or past events that are not connected to the present.
    - Example: _I saw that movie last week._ (It’s a finished event in a finished time frame.)

---

**Why This is Important**  
The lecturer emphasizes that distinguishing between Present Perfect and Past Simple is crucial for speaking about experiences, achievements, and events accurately. A strong understanding of their differences helps avoid common mistakes, such as:

- _Incorrect_: _I have seen that movie last week._
- _Correct_: _I saw that movie last week._

Would you like to proceed to **Part 5: Unfinished vs. Finished Periods**?

 ### **Part 5: Unfinished vs. Finished Periods**

---

The lecturer explains the critical distinction between **unfinished periods** (requiring Present Perfect) and **finished periods** (requiring Past Simple). This distinction helps learners decide which tense to use in different contexts.

---

#### **1. Unfinished Periods (Present Perfect)**

- **Definition**: A period of time that began in the past and continues into the present or is still ongoing.
    
- **Examples of Unfinished Periods**:
    
    - **This week**: _I have worked hard this week._ (The week is still ongoing.)
    - **Today**: _I have had three meetings today._ (The day isn’t over.)
    - **This year**: _Sales have increased this year._ (The year is not finished.)
    - **Since 2020**: _I have lived here since 2020._ (The action started in 2020 and continues.)
    - **For three years**: _I have lived here for three years._ (Three years have passed, but the action is ongoing.)
- **Philosophy of Unfinished Periods**:  
    Present Perfect focuses on actions or events that belong to a **time frame that is still active or relevant**. The lecturer stresses that this is why Present Perfect is used with signal words like _today, this week, since,_ and _for_.
    
- **Key Examples from the Transcript**:
    
    - _I have had a mortgage for five years._ (The mortgage is ongoing.)
    - _I have never been to Greece._ (Referring to one’s life, which is still ongoing.)
    - _Sales have increased this year._ (2023 is not over yet.)

---

#### **2. Finished Periods (Past Simple)**

- **Definition**: A period of time that is completed and disconnected from the present.
    
- **Examples of Finished Periods**:
    
    - **Last week**: _I worked hard last week._ (The week is over.)
    - **Yesterday**: _I had three meetings yesterday._ (The day is finished.)
    - **In 2020**: _I moved here in 2020._ (2020 is in the past and not ongoing.)
    - **For five years (but finished)**: _I lived there for five years._ (The five years are complete and do not connect to the present.)
- **Philosophy of Finished Periods**:  
    Past Simple focuses on actions or events that are part of a **time frame that has ended**. The lecturer emphasizes that these actions are complete, and the time frame does not extend into the present.
    
- **Key Examples from the Transcript**:
    
    - _My parents had a mortgage for 25 years._ (They paid it off; the mortgage is finished.)
    - _I sold my computer last month._ (The action is complete, and "last month" is a finished time frame.)
    - _I met her on Monday._ (Monday is over, and the action is in the past.)

---

#### **3. Comparison Between Unfinished and Finished Periods**

- **Present Perfect** (Unfinished Period):
    
    - _I have been married for five years._ (The marriage is ongoing.)
    - _I have had a student loan for 23 years._ (The loan still exists.)
- **Past Simple** (Finished Period):
    
    - _They were married for five years._ (They are no longer married.)
    - _I had a student loan for five years._ (The loan has been paid off.)

---

#### **4. Signal Words That Indicate Unfinished vs. Finished Periods**

|**Unfinished Periods (Present Perfect)**|**Finished Periods (Past Simple)**|
|---|---|
|Today, this week/month/year|Yesterday, last week/month/year|
|For (ongoing)|For (finished)|
|Since (starting point to now)|Ago|
|Ever/never (life experiences)|Specific past times (e.g., in 2001, on Monday)|

---

#### **5. Practical Examples**

The lecturer provides examples to illustrate the differences:

- **Unfinished Period**:
    - _I have lived here since 2020._  
        (The time period is ongoing, connecting to the present.)
- **Finished Period**:
    - _I lived there in 2020._  
        (The time period is complete and in the past.)

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Unfinished Periods** use Present Perfect because they connect the past to the present.
2. **Finished Periods** use Past Simple because they are entirely in the past.
3. Focus on the signal words to decide which tense to use.
