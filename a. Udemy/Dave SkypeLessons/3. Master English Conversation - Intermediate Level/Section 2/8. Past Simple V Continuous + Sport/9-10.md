**9/20**

In **tennis** and **badminton**, you use a **racket**, which has strings and an open frame. But in **table tennis**, **cricket**, and **baseball**, you use a **bat**, which is a solid piece of equipment without an open frame.

- **Table tennis bat**: Used to hit the lightweight ball back and forth on a table tennis table.
- **Cricket bat**: A flat wooden bat used to hit a hard cricket ball.
- **Baseball bat**: A round wooden (or metal) bat used to hit the baseball.

_(Side note: One reason we call them “bats” is because these hitting tools are **solid** (you can’t see through them), whereas tennis or badminton “rackets” have strings and an open area.)_

**10/20**

For **golf**, you use a **golf club**, not a “golf bat.” Golf is played on a **golf course**, which typically has **18 holes**. The goal is to get the golf ball into each hole with as few strokes (hits) as possible.

- **Athletics track**: A running track for events like the 100m, 400m, 800m, etc.
- **Swimming pool**: The place for swimming and diving. Common swimming strokes include **backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly,** and **front crawl**.
- **Motorcycling / Formula One**: These use a **circuit**—a special track they go around multiple times.
- **Ski slopes**: Different steepness levels (e.g., **black slopes** are the hardest). You have **ski lifts** to carry you up the mountain so you can ski or snowboard back down.

_(Side note: “Steep” means a slope angled sharply downward, requiring more skill. “Gentle” slopes are easier for beginners.)_
