**1/20**

Welcome to the lecture on **Sports** and a quick revision of two important tenses in English: **Past Simple** and **Past Continuous**.

- **Past Simple** often uses the second form of the verb (e.g., “woke,” “broke,” “spoke,” “went,” “beat,” “lost,” “won,” “drew”). Many of these forms are irregular. Regular verbs typically end in **-ed** (“wanted,” “liked,” “played”).
- **Past Continuous** is made with **was/were + the -ing form** (e.g., “was having,” “were playing”). It always has **two words** to show that an action was in progress at a certain point in the past.

_(Side note on grammar terms: “irregular verbs” don’t follow the typical “-ed” rule. You must memorize their different forms—like _beat_ (present), _beat_ (past), _beaten_ (past participle). “Regular verbs” do follow the “-ed” ending, like _play_ → _played_ → _played_.)_

**2/20**

We do not use **continuous forms** with **stative verbs**—these are verbs that describe conditions, feelings, or states rather than actions in progress. Examples of stative verbs include “want,” “know,” “understand,” “like,” “love,” and “see.”

- You **cannot** say “I was wanting” or “I was knowing.”
- Instead, you **must** use the **past simple** for these verbs: “I wanted,” “I knew,” “I understood,” “I liked,” “I loved,” and “I saw.”

_(Side note: Stative verbs deal with states of being or emotions, whereas dynamic verbs describe actions that can be ongoing. For instance, “run,” “play,” “talk,” and “drive” are dynamic and can appear in continuous forms.)_

**3/20**

When you list **one action after another**, each completed in the past, you use the **Past Simple** (e.g., “I woke up, I had breakfast, I went to work.”). The emphasis here is on **completed events** happening in sequence.

However, to describe being **in the middle of an action** at a specific past time, use the **Past Continuous**. For example:

- “At 7:30 this morning, I **was having** breakfast.”
- “I **was walking** to work when it started to rain.”

_(Side note: In these examples, “I was having breakfast” shows you hadn’t finished breakfast at 7:30, so you use “was” + “-ing” to show it was ongoing.)_

**4/20**

When you refer to an action that was **in progress** at a specific point in time, you also use **Past Continuous**. For instance, in a football match at halftime:

- “At halftime, **we were winning** two-nil.”
    - Here, the action (winning) was still ongoing at halftime.

In football scores, especially in British English, “0” is often referred to as **“nil”** (e.g., “one-nil,” “two-nil,” etc.). People **do not** say “zero” or “nought” in this context.

_(Side note: Using “were winning” implies that you were in the middle of the match, so you hadn’t finished the game yet. The Past Continuous is ideal for emphasizing that the action was ongoing.)_

**5/20**

We frequently use **Past Continuous** alongside **Past Simple** when describing two past actions—one short and finished (Past Simple) and one ongoing (Past Continuous). For example:

- “I **broke** my leg (short, completed action) **when I was playing** football (ongoing action).”
    - “Broke” is Past Simple; “was playing” is Past Continuous.

Additionally, “when” can be a clue that you might need the Past Continuous. This is because “when” often links a short completed action to a longer one already in progress.

_(Side note: In “I broke my leg when I was playing football,” the injury happened during the ongoing activity of playing, which is why “was playing” is correct, not “played.”)_

**6/20**

Here are some examples demonstrating Past Simple and Past Continuous together:

- **“We were losing 2–nil when I scored a goal.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “We **were losing** 2–nil.”
    - Completed action: “I **scored** a goal.”
- **“He got injured while he was doing karate.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “He **was doing** karate.”
    - Completed action: “He **got injured**.”
- **“We were drawing 3–all when the referee blew the full-time whistle.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “We **were drawing** 3–all.”
    - Completed action: “The referee **blew** the whistle.”
- **“The spectators were cheering as he sprinted past the finishing line.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “The spectators **were cheering**.”
    - Completed action: “He **sprinted** past the finishing line.”

_(Side note: “nil” is used instead of “zero” in football scores. “Draw” or “drawing” refers to an even score. “Blew the full-time whistle” uses the irregular verb “blow” → “blew” → “blown.” “Cheering” means clapping, shouting, and supporting the team. “Sprint” means to run at top speed.)_

**7/20**

There are different **playing areas** for various sports:

- **Court**: Sports like volleyball, basketball, badminton, and tennis are typically played on a **court**. Even if the tennis court is outdoors, it’s still called a “court.”
- **Pitch**: Sports like football (soccer), rugby, hockey, and cricket are played on a **pitch**—an outdoor field.

_(Side note: Historically, “court” may come from the idea of an indoor royal court, where some of these sports might have originated or were played. A “pitch” is a large, open field. Regardless of location, we keep these names: tennis court, football pitch, etc.)_

**8/20**

On a **tennis court**, you will find a **net** stretched across the middle and you play with a **tennis ball** and **rackets**. In **badminton**, you also have a **net** and **rackets**, but instead of a ball, players use a **shuttlecock**—a light, cone-shaped projectile with a rubber tip and a skirt of feathers or plastic.

If the shuttlecock (in badminton) or the ball (in tennis or volleyball) goes **“out”** (beyond the court boundaries), the player who hit it out **loses the point**.

_(Side note: The term **“shuttlecock”** refers to the item you hit back and forth in badminton. It’s sometimes colloquially called a “birdie” in certain places.)_

**9/20**

In **tennis** and **badminton**, you use a **racket**, which has strings and an open frame. But in **table tennis**, **cricket**, and **baseball**, you use a **bat**, which is a solid piece of equipment without an open frame.

- **Table tennis bat**: Used to hit the lightweight ball back and forth on a table tennis table.
- **Cricket bat**: A flat wooden bat used to hit a hard cricket ball.
- **Baseball bat**: A round wooden (or metal) bat used to hit the baseball.

_(Side note: One reason we call them “bats” is because these hitting tools are **solid** (you can’t see through them), whereas tennis or badminton “rackets” have strings and an open area.)_

**10/20**

For **golf**, you use a **golf club**, not a “golf bat.” Golf is played on a **golf course**, which typically has **18 holes**. The goal is to get the golf ball into each hole with as few strokes (hits) as possible.

- **Athletics track**: A running track for events like the 100m, 400m, 800m, etc.
- **Swimming pool**: The place for swimming and diving. Common swimming strokes include **backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly,** and **front crawl**.
- **Motorcycling / Formula One**: These use a **circuit**—a special track they go around multiple times.
- **Ski slopes**: Different steepness levels (e.g., **black slopes** are the hardest). You have **ski lifts** to carry you up the mountain so you can ski or snowboard back down.

_(Side note: “Steep” means a slope angled sharply downward, requiring more skill. “Gentle” slopes are easier for beginners.)_

**11/20**

It’s important to **memorize many irregular verbs**, as they are crucial for talking about sports (and many common actions). The most frequently used verbs in any language often turn out to be the most irregular. For example:

- **be** → _am / is / are_ (present), _was / were_ (past), _been_ (past participle)
- **beat** → _beat_ (past), _beaten_ (past participle)
- **lose** → _lost_ (past), _lost_ (past participle)
- **win** → _won_ (past), _won_ (past participle)
- **draw** → _drew_ (past), _drawn_ (past participle)

_(Side note: These irregular forms come up frequently in sports contexts—discussing match outcomes, reporting scores, etc.)_

**12/20**

Remember the difference between **beat** and **win**:

- “Yesterday, Manchester United **beat** Chelsea 3–nil.”
    - This means Manchester United defeated Chelsea.
- “Chelsea **lost** 3–nil.”
    - In other words, Chelsea was beaten.
- “Manchester United **won** 3–nil.”

All these statements describe the same outcome from different perspectives. We can also say:

- “Chelsea **were beaten** 3–nil.”

_(Side note: “beat,” “lost,” and “won” are all in the **Past Simple** tense. Also remember we say “3–nil,” not “3–zero” in football scores.)_

**11/20**

It’s important to **memorize many irregular verbs**, as they are crucial for talking about sports (and many common actions). The most frequently used verbs in any language often turn out to be the most irregular. For example:

- **be** → _am / is / are_ (present), _was / were_ (past), _been_ (past participle)
- **beat** → _beat_ (past), _beaten_ (past participle)
- **lose** → _lost_ (past), _lost_ (past participle)
- **win** → _won_ (past), _won_ (past participle)
- **draw** → _drew_ (past), _drawn_ (past participle)

_(Side note: These irregular forms come up frequently in sports contexts—discussing match outcomes, reporting scores, etc.)_

**12/20**

Remember the difference between **beat** and **win**:

- “Yesterday, Manchester United **beat** Chelsea 3–nil.”
    - This means Manchester United defeated Chelsea.
- “Chelsea **lost** 3–nil.”
    - In other words, Chelsea was beaten.
- “Manchester United **won** 3–nil.”

All these statements describe the same outcome from different perspectives. We can also say:

- “Chelsea **were beaten** 3–nil.”

_(Side note: “beat,” “lost,” and “won” are all in the **Past Simple** tense. Also remember we say “3–nil,” not “3–zero” in football scores.)_

**13/20**

If a team **keeps winning** and climbing to the top of its division or league, the team can be **promoted** to a higher division. Conversely, if a team **keeps losing**, it may be **relegated** to a lower division.

- Example: “When our team **won** the division, we got **promoted**.”
- Example: “They **finished** last and were **relegated** to the second division.”

_(Side note: “Promoted” means moved up, and “relegated” means moved down in rank. This terminology is common in leagues for sports like football (soccer).)_

**14/20**

In football (soccer), different **player roles** include:

- **Defenders**: Positioned near the team’s goal to protect it.
- **Midfielders**: Positioned in the middle, linking defense and attack.
- **Attackers/Forwards**: Positioned near the opponent’s goal to score.
- **Goalkeeper**: The only player allowed to use hands (within the penalty area).

There are also **substitutes** on the **bench**. They do not start the game on the field, but the **manager** (coach) may choose to bring them on during the match by swapping out another player. **Wingers** often play along the sides of the pitch, moving quickly to support attacks or defense. The **captain** is the leader on the field, sometimes wearing an armband to indicate this role.

_(Side note: “Bench” refers to the place where substitutes and sometimes non-playing staff sit. “Manager” or “coach” decides tactics and substitutions.)_

**15/20**

In many sports, **tackling** is the action of challenging an opponent to gain possession of the ball:

- In **football (soccer)**, a tackle usually means trying to take the ball away with your feet.
- In **rugby** or **American football**, you tackle by grabbing the opponent and bringing them to the ground.
- In **basketball**, although full-on tackles aren’t allowed, “tackle” can be used loosely to mean an attempt to dispossess an opponent.

You may also hear:

- **Dribble**: Carrying the ball forward by controlling it (commonly used in soccer or basketball).
- **Pass**: Sending the ball to another teammate.
- **Shoot**: Kicking or throwing the ball toward the goal/basket.

_(Side note: “Tackle” generally implies a physical challenge, but the nature of tackling differs by sport. In rugby, it’s full contact; in soccer, you mainly use your feet to dispossess the opponent.)_

**16/20**

When you **shoot** in football, you aim the ball toward the goal, and we say “**shoot at** the goal.” Notice the parallels with other verbs that use “**at**” (e.g., “look at,” “stare at,” “gaze at,” “aim at”). The three forms of **shoot** are “shoot – shot – shot.”

- **Shoot at the goal**
- You might **miss** the goal.
- You might **score** a goal.

If there’s a foul in the penalty area, you **take a penalty**. Unfortunately, some players **miss the penalty**—for example, by shooting wide of the goal or hitting the crossbar.

_(Side note: “shoot at” is the correct construction because you’re directing the shot toward a specific target—similarly to “aim at.” If you succeed, you “score a goal.” If not, you “miss” or “fail to score.”)_

**17/20**

If a player scores three goals in one match, it is called a **hat trick**. In the case of a **foul** (an action that breaks the rules):

- Inside the **penalty area**: The opposing team is awarded a **penalty kick**.
- Outside the penalty area: The opposing team is awarded a **free kick**.

Additionally:

- **Take a corner**: When the ball goes out past the goal line (but not as a goal) after being touched by a defending player. The attacking team kicks the ball in from the corner of the pitch.
- **Take a throw-in**: When the ball goes out at the side of the pitch, a player from the opposing side throws it back into play.

If a player commits a serious foul, the referee may **send the player off** (i.e., show a **red card**). Lesser fouls or misconduct might result in a **yellow card** (a warning). Remember:

- **Show** → _showed_ → _shown_ (irregular)
- **Give** → _gave_ → _given_ (irregular)
- **Send** → _sent_ → _sent_ (irregular)

_(Side note: A “hat trick” is an exceptional achievement—scoring three goals in the same game. A “red card” means the player must leave the match immediately and cannot return.)_

**18/20**

When discussing actions during a match:

- **Control the ball**: Bringing the ball under control, usually with your feet, chest, or another part of your body.
- **Chip the ball**: Kicking it so it lifts up, often over a defender’s head or towards a teammate, especially during corners or free kicks.
- **Push**, **punch**, **kick**, or **trip** an opponent: These are all fouls and are not allowed. For example:
    - “He **tripped** the striker while he **was controlling** the ball.”
    - “The referee **gave** a free kick and **showed** a yellow card.”

To **trip someone up** or **push someone over** causes them to **fall over** (British speakers more commonly say “fall over” rather than “fall down”). These actions are considered **cheating** and typically result in a foul call.

**19/20**

**Cheating** in sports refers to doing something **against the rules** to gain an unfair advantage. Examples include:

- **Using your hands** (if not the goalkeeper in football)
- **Elbowing** an opponent (striking them with your elbow)
- **Tripping** or **pushing** someone deliberately

The **referee** or **official** in charge enforces the rules, awarding free kicks, penalties, or even sending a player off.

_(Side note: The word “cheat” is also used more broadly, not just in sports, but in exams or games, meaning to break rules and gain unfair advantage. In sports, any action outside the allowed regulations is considered cheating.)_

**20/20**

In summary, for talking about **sports** in English, remember these key points:

1. **Tenses**:
    
    - Use **Past Simple** for completed actions or sequences of events.
    - Use **Past Continuous** for ongoing actions at a specific point in the past or when a shorter action interrupts a longer one in progress.
2. **Stative Verbs**: Avoid continuous forms with verbs like “want,” “know,” “understand,” “like,” “love,” or “see.”
    
3. **Irregular Verbs**: Memorize common forms (e.g., **break – broke – broken**, **win – won – won**).
    
4. **Vocabulary for Different Sports**: “Court,” “pitch,” “circuit,” “course,” “pool,” and “track” refer to the playing area, depending on the sport.
    
5. **Actions & Equipment**: Use “bat” for solid implements (cricket, baseball, table tennis) and “racket” for stringed frames (tennis, badminton).
    
6. **Football Specifics**: Understand terms like **tackle, dribble, pass, shoot**, **free kick, penalty**, **substitute, winger, captain**, **score, miss, foul**, **send off, yellow card, red card**, **promoted, relegated**, etc.
    

_(Side note: Practice using these terms in real or hypothetical match scenarios to improve fluency—e.g., describing a memorable match or discussing a sporting event you recently watched.)_
