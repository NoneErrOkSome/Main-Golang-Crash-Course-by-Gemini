**1/20**

Welcome to the lecture on **Sports** and a quick revision of two important tenses in English: **Past Simple** and **Past Continuous**.

- **Past Simple** often uses the second form of the verb (e.g., “woke,” “broke,” “spoke,” “went,” “beat,” “lost,” “won,” “drew”). Many of these forms are irregular. Regular verbs typically end in **-ed** (“wanted,” “liked,” “played”).
- **Past Continuous** is made with **was/were + the -ing form** (e.g., “was having,” “were playing”). It always has **two words** to show that an action was in progress at a certain point in the past.

_(Side note on grammar terms: “irregular verbs” don’t follow the typical “-ed” rule. You must memorize their different forms—like _beat_ (present), _beat_ (past), _beaten_ (past participle). “Regular verbs” do follow the “-ed” ending, like _play_ → _played_ → _played_.)_

We do not use **continuous forms** with **stative verbs**—these are verbs that describe conditions, feelings, or states rather than actions in progress. Examples of stative verbs include “want,” “know,” “understand,” “like,” “love,” and “see.”

- You **cannot** say “I was wanting” or “I was knowing.”
- Instead, you **must** use the **past simple** for these verbs: “I wanted,” “I knew,” “I understood,” “I liked,” “I loved,” and “I saw.”

_(Side note: Stative verbs deal with states of being or emotions, whereas dynamic verbs describe actions that can be ongoing. For instance, “run,” “play,” “talk,” and “drive” are dynamic and can appear in continuous forms.)_
