**5/20**

We frequently use **Past Continuous** alongside **Past Simple** when describing two past actions—one short and finished (Past Simple) and one ongoing (Past Continuous). For example:

- “I **broke** my leg (short, completed action) **when I was playing** football (ongoing action).”
    - “Broke” is Past Simple; “was playing” is Past Continuous.

Additionally, “when” can be a clue that you might need the Past Continuous. This is because “when” often links a short completed action to a longer one already in progress.

_(Side note: In “I broke my leg when I was playing football,” the injury happened during the ongoing activity of playing, which is why “was playing” is correct, not “played.”)_

**6/20**

Here are some examples demonstrating Past Simple and Past Continuous together:

- **“We were losing 2–nil when I scored a goal.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “We **were losing** 2–nil.”
    - Completed action: “I **scored** a goal.”
- **“He got injured while he was doing karate.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “He **was doing** karate.”
    - Completed action: “He **got injured**.”
- **“We were drawing 3–all when the referee blew the full-time whistle.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “We **were drawing** 3–all.”
    - Completed action: “The referee **blew** the whistle.”
- **“The spectators were cheering as he sprinted past the finishing line.”**
    
    - Ongoing action: “The spectators **were cheering**.”
    - Completed action: “He **sprinted** past the finishing line.”

_(Side note: “nil” is used instead of “zero” in football scores. “Draw” or “drawing” refers to an even score. “Blew the full-time whistle” uses the irregular verb “blow” → “blew” → “blown.” “Cheering” means clapping, shouting, and supporting the team. “Sprint” means to run at top speed.)_
