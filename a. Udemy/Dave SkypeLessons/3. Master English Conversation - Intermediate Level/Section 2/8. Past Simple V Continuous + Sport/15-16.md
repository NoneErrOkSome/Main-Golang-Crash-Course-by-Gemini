**15/20**

In many sports, **tackling** is the action of challenging an opponent to gain possession of the ball:

- In **football (soccer)**, a tackle usually means trying to take the ball away with your feet.
- In **rugby** or **American football**, you tackle by grabbing the opponent and bringing them to the ground.
- In **basketball**, although full-on tackles aren’t allowed, “tackle” can be used loosely to mean an attempt to dispossess an opponent.

You may also hear:

- **Dribble**: Carrying the ball forward by controlling it (commonly used in soccer or basketball).
- **Pass**: Sending the ball to another teammate.
- **Shoot**: Kicking or throwing the ball toward the goal/basket.

_(Side note: “Tackle” generally implies a physical challenge, but the nature of tackling differs by sport. In rugby, it’s full contact; in soccer, you mainly use your feet to dispossess the opponent.)_

When you **shoot** in football, you aim the ball toward the goal, and we say “**shoot at** the goal.” Notice the parallels with other verbs that use “**at**” (e.g., “look at,” “stare at,” “gaze at,” “aim at”). The three forms of **shoot** are “shoot – shot – shot.”

- **Shoot at the goal**
- You might **miss** the goal.
- You might **score** a goal.

If there’s a foul in the penalty area, you **take a penalty**. Unfortunately, some players **miss the penalty**—for example, by shooting wide of the goal or hitting the crossbar.

_(Side note: “shoot at” is the correct construction because you’re directing the shot toward a specific target—similarly to “aim at.” If you succeed, you “score a goal.” If not, you “miss” or “fail to score.”)_
