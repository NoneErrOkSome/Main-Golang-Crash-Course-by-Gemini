**7/20**

There are different **playing areas** for various sports:

- **Court**: Sports like volleyball, basketball, badminton, and tennis are typically played on a **court**. Even if the tennis court is outdoors, it’s still called a “court.”
- **Pitch**: Sports like football (soccer), rugby, hockey, and cricket are played on a **pitch**—an outdoor field.

_(Side note: Historically, “court” may come from the idea of an indoor royal court, where some of these sports might have originated or were played. A “pitch” is a large, open field. Regardless of location, we keep these names: tennis court, football pitch, etc.)_

**8/20**

On a **tennis court**, you will find a **net** stretched across the middle and you play with a **tennis ball** and **rackets**. In **badminton**, you also have a **net** and **rackets**, but instead of a ball, players use a **shuttlecock**—a light, cone-shaped projectile with a rubber tip and a skirt of feathers or plastic.

If the shuttlecock (in badminton) or the ball (in tennis or volleyball) goes **“out”** (beyond the court boundaries), the player who hit it out **loses the point**.

_(Side note: The term **“shuttlecock”** refers to the item you hit back and forth in badminton. It’s sometimes colloquially called a “birdie” in certain places.)_
