**17/20**

If a player scores three goals in one match, it is called a **hat trick**. In the case of a **foul** (an action that breaks the rules):

- Inside the **penalty area**: The opposing team is awarded a **penalty kick**.
- Outside the penalty area: The opposing team is awarded a **free kick**.

Additionally:

- **Take a corner**: When the ball goes out past the goal line (but not as a goal) after being touched by a defending player. The attacking team kicks the ball in from the corner of the pitch.
- **Take a throw-in**: When the ball goes out at the side of the pitch, a player from the opposing side throws it back into play.

If a player commits a serious foul, the referee may **send the player off** (i.e., show a **red card**). Lesser fouls or misconduct might result in a **yellow card** (a warning). Remember:

- **Show** → _showed_ → _shown_ (irregular)
- **Give** → _gave_ → _given_ (irregular)
- **Send** → _sent_ → _sent_ (irregular)

_(Side note: A “hat trick” is an exceptional achievement—scoring three goals in the same game. A “red card” means the player must leave the match immediately and cannot return.)_

**18/20**

When discussing actions during a match:

- **Control the ball**: Bringing the ball under control, usually with your feet, chest, or another part of your body.
- **Chip the ball**: Kicking it so it lifts up, often over a defender’s head or towards a teammate, especially during corners or free kicks.
- **Push**, **punch**, **kick**, or **trip** an opponent: These are all fouls and are not allowed. For example:
    - “He **tripped** the striker while he **was controlling** the ball.”
    - “The referee **gave** a free kick and **showed** a yellow card.”

To **trip someone up** or **push someone over** causes them to **fall over** (British speakers more commonly say “fall over” rather than “fall down”). These actions are considered **cheating** and typically result in a foul call.
