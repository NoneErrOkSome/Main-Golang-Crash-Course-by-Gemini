**19/20**

**Cheating** in sports refers to doing something **against the rules** to gain an unfair advantage. Examples include:

- **Using your hands** (if not the goalkeeper in football)
- **Elbowing** an opponent (striking them with your elbow)
- **Tripping** or **pushing** someone deliberately

The **referee** or **official** in charge enforces the rules, awarding free kicks, penalties, or even sending a player off.

_(Side note: The word “cheat” is also used more broadly, not just in sports, but in exams or games, meaning to break rules and gain unfair advantage. In sports, any action outside the allowed regulations is considered cheating.)_

**20/20**

In summary, for talking about **sports** in English, remember these key points:

1. **Tenses**:
    
    - Use **Past Simple** for completed actions or sequences of events.
    - Use **Past Continuous** for ongoing actions at a specific point in the past or when a shorter action interrupts a longer one in progress.
2. **Stative Verbs**: Avoid continuous forms with verbs like “want,” “know,” “understand,” “like,” “love,” or “see.”
    
3. **Irregular Verbs**: Memorize common forms (e.g., **break – broke – broken**, **win – won – won**).
    
4. **Vocabulary for Different Sports**: “Court,” “pitch,” “circuit,” “course,” “pool,” and “track” refer to the playing area, depending on the sport.
    
5. **Actions & Equipment**: Use “bat” for solid implements (cricket, baseball, table tennis) and “racket” for stringed frames (tennis, badminton).
    
6. **Football Specifics**: Understand terms like **tackle, dribble, pass, shoot**, **free kick, penalty**, **substitute, winger, captain**, **score, miss, foul**, **send off, yellow card, red card**, **promoted, relegated**, etc.
    

_(Side note: Practice using these terms in real or hypothetical match scenarios to improve fluency—e.g., describing a memorable match or discussing a sporting event you recently watched.)_
