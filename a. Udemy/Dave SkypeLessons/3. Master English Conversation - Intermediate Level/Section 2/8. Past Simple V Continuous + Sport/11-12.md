**11/20**

It’s important to **memorize many irregular verbs**, as they are crucial for talking about sports (and many common actions). The most frequently used verbs in any language often turn out to be the most irregular. For example:

- **be** → _am / is / are_ (present), _was / were_ (past), _been_ (past participle)
- **beat** → _beat_ (past), _beaten_ (past participle)
- **lose** → _lost_ (past), _lost_ (past participle)
- **win** → _won_ (past), _won_ (past participle)
- **draw** → _drew_ (past), _drawn_ (past participle)

_(Side note: These irregular forms come up frequently in sports contexts—discussing match outcomes, reporting scores, etc.)_

**12/20**

Remember the difference between **beat** and **win**:

- “Yesterday, Manchester United **beat** Chelsea 3–nil.”
    - This means Manchester United defeated Chelsea.
- “Chelsea **lost** 3–nil.”
    - In other words, Chelsea was beaten.
- “Manchester United **won** 3–nil.”

All these statements describe the same outcome from different perspectives. We can also say:

- “Chelsea **were beaten** 3–nil.”

_(Side note: “beat,” “lost,” and “won” are all in the **Past Simple** tense. Also remember we say “3–nil,” not “3–zero” in football scores.)_
