**13/20**

If a team **keeps winning** and climbing to the top of its division or league, the team can be **promoted** to a higher division. Conversely, if a team **keeps losing**, it may be **relegated** to a lower division.

- Example: “When our team **won** the division, we got **promoted**.”
- Example: “They **finished** last and were **relegated** to the second division.”

_(Side note: “Promoted” means moved up, and “relegated” means moved down in rank. This terminology is common in leagues for sports like football (soccer).)_

**14/20**

In football (soccer), different **player roles** include:

- **Defenders**: Positioned near the team’s goal to protect it.
- **Midfielders**: Positioned in the middle, linking defense and attack.
- **Attackers/Forwards**: Positioned near the opponent’s goal to score.
- **Goalkeeper**: The only player allowed to use hands (within the penalty area).

There are also **substitutes** on the **bench**. They do not start the game on the field, but the **manager** (coach) may choose to bring them on during the match by swapping out another player. **Wingers** often play along the sides of the pitch, moving quickly to support attacks or defense. The **captain** is the leader on the field, sometimes wearing an armband to indicate this role.

_(Side note: “Bench” refers to the place where substitutes and sometimes non-playing staff sit. “Manager” or “coach” decides tactics and substitutions.)_
