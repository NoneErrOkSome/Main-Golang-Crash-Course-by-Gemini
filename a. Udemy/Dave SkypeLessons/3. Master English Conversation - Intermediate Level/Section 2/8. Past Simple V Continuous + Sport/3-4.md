**3/20**

When you list **one action after another**, each completed in the past, you use the **Past Simple** (e.g., “I woke up, I had breakfast, I went to work.”). The emphasis here is on **completed events** happening in sequence.

However, to describe being **in the middle of an action** at a specific past time, use the **Past Continuous**. For example:

- “At 7:30 this morning, I **was having** breakfast.”
- “I **was walking** to work when it started to rain.”

_(Side note: In these examples, “I was having breakfast” shows you hadn’t finished breakfast at 7:30, so you use “was” + “-ing” to show it was ongoing.)_

**4/20**

When you refer to an action that was **in progress** at a specific point in time, you also use **Past Continuous**. For instance, in a football match at halftime:

- “At halftime, **we were winning** two-nil.”
    - Here, the action (winning) was still ongoing at halftime.

In football scores, especially in British English, “0” is often referred to as **“nil”** (e.g., “one-nil,” “two-nil,” etc.). People **do not** say “zero” or “nought” in this context.

_(Side note: Using “were winning” implies that you were in the middle of the match, so you hadn’t finished the game yet. The Past Continuous is ideal for emphasizing that the action was ongoing.)_
