### Part 1/35: **Introduction and Overview**

The focus of this lesson is on **driving vocabulary** and the **three main past tenses**:

- **Past Simple**
- **Past Continuous**
- **Past Perfect**

The lecturer briefly mentions that there is a fourth tense, **Past Perfect Continuous**, but it will be covered in another class. For today, the lesson is centered on understanding the three past tenses, their differences, and how they are applied in real-life situations, particularly in storytelling. Driving vocabulary is also tied into the lesson with practical examples and questions to engage learners.

The lecturer's personal opinion emphasizes the importance of **Past Simple** over the other two tenses, noting that it is used **90% of the time** in conversations and storytelling. However, understanding **Past Continuous** and **Past Perfect** is crucial for creating richer, more accurate narratives.

### Key Learning Objectives:

1. **Understand Past Simple**: Used for consecutive actions, where events happen one after the other.
2. **Understand Past Continuous**: Used for actions that were ongoing at a specific point in the past.
3. **Understand Past Perfect**: Used to describe actions that were completed before another past action.
4. **Learn Driving Vocabulary**: Phrasal verbs, key terms (e.g., "run out of petrol," "break down"), and driving-related expressions.
5. **Practice Storytelling**: Using the three past tenses to tell stories, especially about driving experiences.

The lecturer stresses that **storytelling** is a great way to practice combining these tenses and mastering their usage. The goal is not only to learn the grammar but also to apply it practically in conversational contexts.

### Part 2/35: **Past Simple Overview**

**Definition:**  
Past Simple is used for **consecutive actions** that happen in the past and are completed. These actions occur one after the other in a sequence.

**Key Concept:**  
When describing past events in a **chronological order**, Past Simple is the most appropriate tense. It is often signaled by words like **"then"** or other markers that indicate a series of actions.

### Examples (from the transcript):

1. **I woke up at 9:00. I got up at 9:15. I had a shower at 9:30. I ate my breakfast at 9:45. I started work at 10:00.**
    
    - Each action is **completed** before the next one begins.
    - The use of **"then"** can highlight the sequence: "I woke up, then I got up, then I had a shower, then I ate my breakfast."
2. **I got to work, and I realized I had left my wallet at home.**
    
    - The action **"got to work"** is in Past Simple as it happens in the present sequence of the story.

### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer explains that Past Simple is by far the most **commonly used past tense** in English, especially in storytelling. It is essential to understand it as the "default" tense when narrating past events.

**Tips from the Lecturer:**

- Look for markers like **"then"** or implied sequences in sentences.
- Use Past Simple whenever youâ€™re **listing events** that happened one after another.
- Focus on completing one idea before moving to the next.

### Part 3/35: **Past Continuous Overview**

**Definition:**  
Past Continuous is used to describe actions that were **ongoing** or **in progress** at a specific moment in the past. It conveys that the action was **not yet completed** at the time being referred to.

---

### Key Concept:

Past Continuous often sets the **background** for another action that interrupts it, which is typically in Past Simple. Signal words like **"while"** and **"as"** are commonly used to indicate ongoing actions.

---

### Examples (from the transcript):

1. **I was doing my homework when the phone rang.**
    
    - **"I was doing my homework"** shows an ongoing action.
    - **"The phone rang"** is a shorter, completed action that interrupts the ongoing action.
2. **I was running when the sun was shining.**
    
    - **"I was running"** and **"the sun was shining"** both describe actions that were happening at the same time in the past.
    - Neither action is completed; they are both in progress.

---

### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer highlights that Past Continuous emphasizes the **middle of an action**, showing that something was ongoing. It is especially useful in storytelling to provide **context or atmosphere** for other events.

**Tips from the Lecturer:**

- Look for **"while"** or **"as"** in sentences. These are strong indicators of Past Continuous.
- Remember, Past Continuous often works with Past Simple: the longer action (Past Continuous) gets interrupted by a shorter action (Past Simple).
- Use Past Continuous to make your stories richer and more detailed by describing ongoing actions in the past.
