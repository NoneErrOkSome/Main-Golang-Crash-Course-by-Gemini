### Part 31/35: **Frequency of Tense Use in Storytelling**

This section explores how often **Past Simple**, **Past Continuous**, and **Past Perfect** are used in storytelling and why some tenses are more common than others.

---

### 1. **Past Simple: Most Frequently Used (90%)**

- **Why it’s Common:**
    - It is the default tense for narrating a series of completed actions.
    - Stories typically move forward step by step, making Past Simple ideal for describing sequential events.
- **Examples:**
    - "I woke up, got dressed, and went to work."
    - "He opened the door, stepped outside, and saw it was raining."

---

### 2. **Past Continuous: Less Frequent (6–7%)**

- **Why it’s Less Common:**
    - Used primarily for setting the scene or providing background information.
    - Adds richness to the story but is secondary to the main actions described in Past Simple.
- **Examples:**
    - "The sun was shining, and birds were singing as I walked through the park."
    - "I was reading a book when the phone rang."

---

### 3. **Past Perfect: Rarely Used (3–4%)**

- **Why it’s Rare:**
    - Reserved for clarifying actions that occurred **earlier** in the timeline.
    - Its specific purpose means it’s not needed as often as Past Simple or Past Continuous.
- **Examples:**
    - "By the time I arrived, they had already left."
    - "She realized she had forgotten her keys at home."

- **Practicality:** Commonly used in everyday English, especially in informal contexts.
- **Versatility:** They often have multiple meanings (e.g., "pick up" for collecting someone or learning something).
