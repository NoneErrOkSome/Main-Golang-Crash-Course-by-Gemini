### Part 4/35: **Past Perfect Overview**

**Definition:**  
Past Perfect is used to describe actions that were **completed** before another action in the past. It often signals a step **backward in time** within a story, showing that one event happened earlier than another.

---

### Key Concept:

Past Perfect uses the structure **"had" + past participle** to indicate that the action happened **before** another action, which is often in Past Simple. It helps clarify the sequence of events, especially when the order is not obvious.

---

### Examples (from the transcript):

1. **I got to work, and I realized I had left my wallet at home.**
    
    - **"I had left my wallet at home"** happened **before** arriving at work.
    - The phrase **"had left"** signals going back to an earlier moment in the story.
2. **I noticed I had almost run out of petrol.**
    
    - **"I had almost run out of petrol"** occurred **earlier** than the moment of noticing it.
    - This creates a timeline:
        - First: Petrol ran low.
        - Then: You noticed it.

---

### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer emphasizes that Past Perfect is not about describing "the next thing" but rather about showing **what happened earlier** in a sequence of events. The use of **"had"** instantly signals that you are going back to a point in the past before the current moment in the narrative.

---

### Tips from the Lecturer:

- Think of **"had"** as a marker for "earlier" in your story.
- Use Past Perfect to avoid confusion when describing two events in the past, making it clear which one happened first.
- Past Perfect often appears in combination with Past Simple (e.g., **I realized** + **I had left**).
- Look for scenarios where you want to **explain cause and effect** (e.g., "I missed the bus because I had overslept").

### Part 5/35: **Comparison of the Three Tenses (Past Simple, Past Continuous, Past Perfect)**

**Key Differences:**  
The lecturer explains how these three tenses differ in **timeline** and **purpose**, using timelines and examples to clarify their usage.

---

### 1. **Past Simple:**

- **Purpose:** To describe actions that happen **consecutively** (one after the other).
- **Example Timeline:**  
    **| Event 1 (Finished) | Event 2 (Finished) | Event 3 (Finished) |**
    - Example: "I got up, I had breakfast, I went to work."

---

### 2. **Past Continuous:**

- **Purpose:** To describe an **ongoing action** in the past, often interrupted by another action.
- **Example Timeline:**  
    **| Action in progress | Event happens (interrupts) |**
    - Example: "I was reading a book when the phone rang."

---

### 3. **Past Perfect:**

- **Purpose:** To describe an action that happened **earlier** than another past event.
- **Example Timeline:**  
    **| Earlier Action (Past Perfect) | Later Action (Past Simple) |**
    - Example: "I realized I had left my wallet at home."

---

### Combined Example (from the transcript):

**"While I was driving (Past Continuous) on the motorway, I noticed (Past Simple) I had almost run out of petrol (Past Perfect)."**

- **Past Continuous (Was driving):** Ongoing action in the past (background).
- **Past Simple (Noticed):** The moment you became aware of something.
- **Past Perfect (Had almost run out):** Indicates an earlier action (petrol running out).

---

### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer highlights that **each tense serves a distinct purpose** in storytelling:

- **Past Simple** keeps the narrative moving forward.
- **Past Continuous** provides background context and sets the scene.
- **Past Perfect** helps add depth by explaining what happened earlier.

---

### Tips from the Lecturer:

- Use **Past Simple** to narrate a series of actions in order.
- Use **Past Continuous** to set the background or describe simultaneous actions.
- Use **Past Perfect** sparingly to highlight key earlier events, especially in storytelling or explanations.

### Part 6/35: **Key Signal Words for Past Continuous and Past Perfect**

**Overview:**  
Certain words act as strong indicators for when to use Past Continuous or Past Perfect. Recognizing these signal words can help you identify the correct tense quickly.

---

### 1. **Signal Words for Past Continuous:**

Past Continuous often uses **"while"** or **"as"** to show that an action was ongoing during a specific moment in the past.

- **Examples (from the transcript):**
    
    1. **"While I was driving on the motorway, I noticed..."**
        - **"While"** shows the ongoing action of driving.
    2. **"As I was turning the corner, another car appeared."**
        - **"As"** emphasizes the action happening at the same time (turning the corner).
- **Key Notes:**
    
    - Both **"while"** and **"as"** highlight that the action was **in progress**.
    - These words set up the background action for another shorter event (usually in Past Simple).

---

### 2. **Signal Words for Past Perfect:**

Past Perfect uses words that indicate something happened **earlier** than another event, such as:

- **"Had" + Past Participle**
    
- Words like **"already," "before," "by the time," "earlier."**
    
- **Examples (from the transcript):**
    
    1. **"I realized I had almost run out of petrol."**
        - The word **"had"** signals an earlier action (petrol running out).
    2. **"Another car appeared, which hadn't stopped at the red light."**
        - **"Hadn't stopped"** clarifies that the action of not stopping happened before the car appeared.
- **Key Notes:**
    
    - The structure of **"had + verb"** is the main clue.
    - Words like **"earlier"** or phrases like **"by the time"** often imply a need for Past Perfect.

---

### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

The lecturer emphasizes that recognizing these signal words can make tense selection much easier. They are especially useful in **storytelling** when actions overlap or occur at different points in the past.

---

### Tips from the Lecturer:

- For Past Continuous, focus on **"while"** and **"as"** to describe simultaneous or ongoing actions.
- For Past Perfect, look for **"had"** to signal actions that occurred earlier in the timeline.
- Practice combining these tenses by using signal words in your own sentences.
