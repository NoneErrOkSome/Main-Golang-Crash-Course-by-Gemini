### Part 26/35: **Driving Tips from the Whiteboard: Overtaking, Dangerous Situations, and Driving Abroad**

This section explores practical driving advice highlighted on the whiteboard, emphasizing safety and understanding driving rules in various contexts.

---

### 1. **When It’s Dangerous to Overtake**

- **Key Points from the Whiteboard:**
    
    - **Do not overtake:**
        - On bends or curves.
        - Near the top of a hill (blind spots).
        - When there is oncoming traffic.

- **Vocabulary Related to Overtaking:**
    
    - **Blind Spot:** The area around your car that you cannot see with mirrors.
        - Example: "A car in your blind spot could cause an accident when overtaking."
    - **Oncoming Traffic:** Vehicles approaching from the opposite direction.
        - Example: "Never overtake when there’s oncoming traffic."

### 2. **Driving in Dangerous Situations**

- **Tips from the Whiteboard:**
    
    - Reduce speed in adverse conditions, such as:

### Part 27/35: **Practice Questions on Driving Experiences**

This section focuses on practice questions inspired by the whiteboard and lecture to encourage storytelling and grammar practice using **Past Simple**, **Past Continuous**, and **Past Perfect**.

---

### 1. **Questions to Practice Past Simple**

- Describe consecutive actions in a driving experience:
    - "What happened the first time you drove a car?"
        - Example Response: "I got in the car, adjusted my seat, started the engine, and drove slowly."
    - "Can you recall a road trip you went on? What did you do step by step?"
        - Example Response: "We packed our bags, filled up the tank, and set off early in the morning."

---

### 2. **Questions to Practice Past Continuous**

- Describe background actions during an event:
    - "What were you doing when you first realized you were running out of petrol?"
        - Example Response: "I was driving on the motorway when I noticed the fuel gauge was low."
    - "Can you describe a time when you were driving and something unexpected happened?"
        - Example Response: "I was turning the corner when another car suddenly appeared."

---

### 3. **Questions to Practice Past Perfect**

- Reflect on earlier actions in relation to a later event:
    - "What had you done before your car broke down?"
        - Example Response: "I had driven for several hours without checking the engine."
    - "What had happened before you got stuck in a traffic jam?"
        - Example Response: "An accident had occurred further up the motorway, causing delays."

---

### 4. **Mixed-Tense Questions**

- Combine all three tenses for complex storytelling:
    - "While you were driving, what did you notice? Had anything unusual happened earlier?"
        - Example Response: "While I was driving home, I noticed I had forgotten my wallet at the petrol station."
    - "Can you tell me about a time when you were driving and had to stop suddenly?"
        - Example Response: "While I was driving to work, a dog ran into the road. I realized I had forgotten to check my brakes earlier, which made stopping difficult."

---

### Lecturer’s Insight:

The lecturer emphasizes that answering these questions helps integrate grammar practice with storytelling skills. They recommend focusing on **sequencing events clearly** and using signal words like **"while," "when,"** and **"had."**
