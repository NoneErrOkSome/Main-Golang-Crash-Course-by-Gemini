### Part 7/35: **First Sentence Breakdown: "While I was driving, I noticed I had almost run out of petrol"**

This sentence demonstrates the use of all three past tenses (**Past Continuous**, **Past Simple**, and **Past Perfect**) in a single context. Let’s break it down:

---

### 1. **Past Continuous: "While I was driving"**

- **Meaning:** The action of driving was ongoing at the time being referred to.
- **Key Signal Word:** "While" indicates that this action was happening in the background.
- **Why it's Past Continuous:** The focus is on the **ongoing nature** of the action, not its completion.

---

### 2. **Past Simple: "I noticed"**

- **Meaning:** The act of noticing is a shorter, completed action that occurs during the longer action (driving).
- **Why it's Past Simple:** The verb "noticed" describes a momentary action, which interrupts the longer action (driving).

---

### 3. **Past Perfect: "I had almost run out of petrol"**

- **Meaning:** Running out of petrol happened **before** the noticing.
- **Why it's Past Perfect:** The phrase "had almost run out" refers to a completed action that occurred **earlier** in the timeline.

---

### Timeline Explanation:

1. **First:** The petrol was almost gone (Past Perfect: "had almost run out").
2. **Second:** The speaker noticed this (Past Simple: "noticed").
3. **Third:** At the time of noticing, they were in the middle of driving (Past Continuous: "was driving").

---

### Alternative Interpretation:

The lecturer explains that **"was running out of petrol"** (Past Continuous) could also be correct here. However, it slightly changes the meaning:

- **"Had almost run out":** The petrol was nearly finished (focus on completion).
- **"Was running out":** The petrol was in the process of decreasing (focus on the ongoing action).

**Key Difference:**

- "Had almost run out" implies that the petrol level was dangerously low, needing immediate action.
- "Was running out" suggests the petrol was decreasing but not necessarily at a critical point yet.

---

### Personal Insight from the Lecturer:

- The use of Past Perfect emphasizes the **result**: running out of petrol leads to a breakdown.
- The word **"almost"** strengthens the idea of near completion in Past Perfect, adding urgency to the situation.

---

### Vocabulary Focus: "Run out of"

- **Definition:** To have none left.
- **Examples:**
    - "I ran out of petrol." (No petrol left.)
    - "We ran out of coffee." (No coffee left.)
    - "I’m afraid we’ll run out of time." (No time remaining.)

### Part 9/35: **Second Sentence Breakdown: "As I was turning the corner, another car appeared, which hadn’t stopped at the red light"**

This sentence demonstrates the use of **Past Continuous**, **Past Simple**, and **Past Perfect**, showcasing how these tenses interact in storytelling.

---

### 1. **Past Continuous: "As I was turning the corner"**

- **Meaning:** The action of turning the corner was **in progress** at that moment.
- **Key Signal Word:** "As" indicates that the action was happening in the background.
- **Why it's Past Continuous:** The focus is on the **ongoing nature** of turning the corner, not its completion.

---

### 2. **Past Simple: "Another car appeared"**

- **Meaning:** The appearance of the car was a short, completed action that occurred while the speaker was turning.
- **Why it's Past Simple:** It marks a single, momentary event that happens during the ongoing action (turning the corner).

---

### 3. **Past Perfect: "Which hadn’t stopped at the red light"**

- **Meaning:** The action of not stopping at the red light happened **before** the car appeared.
- **Why it's Past Perfect:** The phrase "hadn’t stopped" clarifies the earlier event (ignoring the red light) that caused the later event (the car appearing suddenly).

---

### Timeline Explanation:

1. **First:** The other car didn’t stop at the red light (**Past Perfect: hadn’t stopped**).
2. **Second:** The other car appeared (**Past Simple: appeared**).
3. **Third:** The speaker was already turning the corner when this happened (**Past Continuous: was turning**).

---

### Lecturer’s Insight:

- The lecturer emphasizes the use of **"hadn’t stopped"** to indicate that the car’s failure to stop at the red light happened earlier.
- Using Past Perfect avoids confusion by making the sequence of events clear:
    - First, the car failed to stop.
    - Then, it appeared while the speaker was turning.

---

### Vocabulary Focus: "Stop at the red light"

- **Definition:** To halt your vehicle when the traffic light is red.
- **Related Terms:**
    - "Green light" (you can go), "yellow light" (prepare to stop), "red light" (you must stop).
    - **Phrasal Verb:** "Pull over" – to move your car to the side of the road and stop.
    - **Example:** "The police officer told me to pull over because I didn’t stop at the red light."

---

### Alternative Interpretations:

The lecturer notes that **Past Continuous** could also work for the red-light scenario if the focus were on the car being in the process of not stopping (e.g., "The car wasn’t stopping at the red light"). However, Past Perfect is preferred here to emphasize the **sequence of events.**
