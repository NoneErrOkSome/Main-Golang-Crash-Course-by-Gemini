        - _"I had breakfast at 8 AM."_ (Correct)
        - _"I had a breakfast at 8 AM."_ (Incorrect)
    - Insight: Meals are treated as uncountable in these phrases.

    - Examples:
        - _"He goes to school every day."_ (Correct)

    - Examples:
        - _"He took the bus to work."_ (Correct)
        - _"We took a taxi to the station."_ (Correct)
    - Insight: Articles clarify whether you’re referring to a specific or general mode of transport.
6. **No Article with "By" Prepositions**:
    
    - Phrases: _go by car, go by train, go by bus._
    - Examples:
        - _"She went by train to the city."_ (Correct)
