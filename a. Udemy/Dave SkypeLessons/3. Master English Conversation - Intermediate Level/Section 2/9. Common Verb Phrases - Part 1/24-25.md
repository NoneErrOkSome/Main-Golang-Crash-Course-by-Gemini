        - Future: _"I will take a bus tomorrow."_
3. **Focus on Context**:
    
    - Understand the meaning behind the phrase. For instance:
        - _"Make"_ involves creating or producing (_"make a cake"_).
        - _"Do"_ relates to tasks or actions (_"do the dishes"_).
4. **Check Prepositions and Articles**:
