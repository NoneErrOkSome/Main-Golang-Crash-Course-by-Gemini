🟩 **PART 5: Do As Much Speaking As Possible**

---

### ✅ **Lesson Focus**

Train your mouth, tongue, and mind to **speak naturally and confidently** through daily speaking practice — with **energy**, **emotion**, and **repetition**.

---

### 🧠 **Why This Matters**

- Speaking builds **muscle memory** for sound production
    
- Repeating difficult phrases strengthens **pronunciation accuracy**
    
- Speaking with **enthusiasm** improves rhythm, tone, and listener engagement
    

---

### 🗣️ **What to Practice Daily**

#### 1. 🧩 **Repeat Difficult Words**

Target words that twist your tongue or confuse your brain.

Examples:

- `squirrel` – /ˈskwɪr.əl/
    
- `rural` – /ˈrʊə.rəl/
    
- `answer` – /ˈɑːn.sə/ (no “w” sound)
    
- `Roger the warrior` (tongue twister)
    

> 🔁 Say each word or phrase **10 times** slowly → then faster

---

#### 2. 🎭 **Speak with Enthusiasm**

Don’t speak like a robot — express **emotion**:

- Add **intonation** (rise and fall)
    
- **Pause** dramatically
    
- Smile while speaking — it changes your tone!
    

> 🗨️ Example:  
> “I _absolutely_ LOVE learning English!”

---

#### 3. 🔄 **Use Tongue Twisters**

Train your **precision and speed** using sound-focused drills.

Examples:

- “Roger the warrior and Ravi the warrior were reared wrongly in a rural brewery.”
    
- “She sells seashells by the seashore.”
    
- “Red lorry, yellow lorry, red lorry, yellow lorry.”
    

> 🎧 Listen → Read aloud → Record → Fix
