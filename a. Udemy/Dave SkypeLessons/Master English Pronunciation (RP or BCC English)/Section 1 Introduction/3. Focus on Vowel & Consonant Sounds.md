🟩 **PART 3: Focus on Vowel & Consonant Sounds**

---

### ✅ **Lesson Focus**

Train your ear and tongue to **hear** and **pronounce** the most difficult sounds in English accurately — especially **vowels** and **consonants** — using **minimal pairs** and focused repetition.

---

### 🧠 **Why This Matters**

- English has many sounds that are **absent in other languages**
    
- **Mispronouncing a single sound** can completely change a word’s meaning  
    _(e.g., “pool” vs. “Paul”, “thy” vs. “thigh”)_
    
- Native-like clarity depends on your ability to distinguish and produce these subtle differences

### 🔤 **Key Sound Categories**

#### 1. 🔊 **Vowels**

- **Short vowels**: _bit, bet, bat, but, pot_
    
- **Long vowels**: _beat, part, pool, calm, moon_
    
- **Diphthongs** (2 sounds in 1): _boy, go, how, my_
    

> 🎯 Focus Example:  
> **/uː/** vs **/ɔː/**
> 
> - _pool_ /puːl/
>     
> - _Paul_ /pɔːl/
>     

---

#### 2. 🧱 **Consonants**

- **Voiced** = vibration (_/v/, /z/, /b/_)
    
- **Voiceless** = no vibration (_/f/, /s/, /p/_)
    

> 🎯 Focus Example:  
> **/ð/** vs **/θ/**
> 
> - _thy_ /ðaɪ/ (voiced)
>     
> - _thigh_ /θaɪ/ (voiceless)
>     
> - _loath_ vs _loathe_
>

### 🧪 **Use Minimal Pairs**

Minimal pairs are words that differ by **only one sound** — perfect for targeting specific pronunciation problems.

|Sound Focus|Minimal Pair Examples|
|---|---|
|/θ/ vs /ð/|_thigh_ / _thy_, _loath_ / _loathe_|
|/uː/ vs /ɔː/|_pool_ / _Paul_, _doom_ / _dorm_|
|/b/ vs /v/|_bat_ / _vat_, _berry_ / _very_|

> 📌 Practice Method:
> 
> 1. Listen to both words (use Cambridge or Google Dictionary)
>     
> 2. Say both 10 times, switching quickly:  
>     _“thigh–thy–thigh–thy...”_
>     
> 3. Record and review
>

### 🗣️ **Drill Practice Sentences**

|Target Sound|Practice Sentence|
|---|---|
|/θ/ vs /ð/|“The thief thanked them thoroughly.”|
|/uː/ vs /ɔː/|“He pulled the pool door near Paul.”|
|/b/ vs /v/|“Barry bought a velvet vest.”|

### 🔍 **Error Detection Tips**

- Can’t hear the difference? **Slow the recording speed down**
    
- Can’t pronounce one? Start by **isolating the sound**, then add syllables
    
- Not sure you got it right? Record and compare with dictionary audio
    

---

### 📝 **Assignment**

1. Choose **2 minimal pairs** you find hard (e.g., _pool / Paul_, _thigh / thy_)
    
2. Write a sentence for each pair
    
3. Read the sentence aloud 10 times
    
4. Record and listen to check your clarity

### 🧠 **Bonus Tools**

- 🧑‍🏫 Use Cambridge Dictionary’s pronunciation audio
    
- 🎧 Try shadowing: repeat the word **immediately after** the native speaker
    
- 🗃️ Store difficult sounds in an **Anki deck** to review regularly

### 🎯 QUOTE TO REMEMBER:

> **“Small sound, big meaning.”** — One mispronounced vowel can break communication
