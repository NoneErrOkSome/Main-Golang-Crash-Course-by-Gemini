🟩 **PART 1: Read Aloud with Enthusiasm**

---

### ✅ **Lesson Focus**

This part trains you to improve your pronunciation by reading out loud **enthusiastically**, focusing on:

- Words that are **hard to pronounce**
    
- Words with **confusing spelling**
    
- **Silent letters** that don’t appear in speech
    
- **Emotional expression** and **enjoyment** while reading
    

---

### 🧠 **Why This Matters**

- Reading aloud builds **muscle memory** for pronunciation
    
- Engaging emotionally helps you **retain the rhythm** and sound of English
    
- Repetition of tricky words builds **confidence**
    
- Encourages awareness of **how English is written vs. spoken**

### 🔤 **Key Practice Techniques**

#### 1. 🗣️ Repeat Difficult Words to Pronounce

Say each word **slowly** first, then **faster** as you gain control.

Examples:

- `squirrel` → _"skwɪrəl"_
    
- `answer` → _"ˈɑːnsə"_ (No "w" sound!)
    
- `rural` → _"ˈrʊərəl"_ (difficult for many learners)
    

> 🔁 Repeat 10 times each. Record yourself to check clarity.

---

#### 2. 🧩 Repeat Words That Are Hard to Spell

These words don’t look like how they sound.

Examples:

- `colonel` → _"kernel"_
    
- `choir` → _"kwai-er"_
    
- `debt` → _"det"_ (silent **b**)
    
- `thumb` → _"thum"_ (silent **b**)
    
- `answer` → _"ɑːnsə"_ (silent **w**)
    

> 🔍 Highlight the silent letters. Practice slowly to internalize the spelling-sound mismatch.

#### 3. 🎭 Read with Enthusiasm

Speak with feeling! Imagine you're acting:

- **Add emotion** to your voice
    
- **Change your tone** to match the sentence
    
- **Pause** for dramatic effect
    

> ✅ Example prompt:  
> "I **absolutely love** learning English!"  
> Say it with excitement — not like a robot.

### 🔄 **Mini Repetition Drill**

|choir|“The choir sang beautifully.”|

- Pronounce only what you hear, **not what you see**
    
- **Joyful practice** makes it stick

    “Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel…” until smooth
