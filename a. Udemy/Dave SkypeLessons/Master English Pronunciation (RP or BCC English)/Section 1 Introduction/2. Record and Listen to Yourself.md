🟩 **PART 2: Record and Listen to Yourself**

---

### ✅ **Lesson Focus**

Train your **self-awareness** and **error correction** by actively recording and reviewing your own voice.

---

### 🧠 **Why This Matters**

- Your brain hears your voice **differently** than it sounds to others.
    
- Listening to a recording reveals **mistakes you can’t hear while speaking**.
    
- This step helps correct **pronunciation**, **stress**, and **rhythm** faster than repetition alone.

### 🎯 **Core Practice Routine**

#### 1. 🎤 **Record Yourself Regularly**

Use your phone, laptop, or any recording app.  
Recommended tools:

- Phone voice recorder
    
- Audacity (desktop)
    
- Online tools (Vocaroo, Voice Spice)
    

> 🎙️ **Record yourself reading aloud** for 1–2 minutes per session.

---

#### 2. 🎧 **Listen Actively**

After recording:

- Play it back **with focus**
    
- Don’t just _hear_—**analyze**
    
- Mark words you mispronounce or sound awkward
    

> 💡 Tip: Use headphones for clearer detail.

#### 3. 🧩 **Identify Specific Problem Sounds**

Focus on these common issues:

- **Silent letters** (e.g., _thumb_, _answer_)
    
- **Wrong stress** (e.g., _PERson_ vs _perSON_)
    
- **Minimal pairs** (e.g., _pool_ vs _Paul_, _thy_ vs _thigh_)
    
- **Consonants** that get dropped (e.g., the **t** in _listen_)

### 🛠️ **Correction Strategy**

#### 📌 Step-by-Step:

1. Record → Listen → Identify → Repeat → Re-record
    
2. Choose 3 problematic words or phrases.
    
3. Say them **10 times**, clearly and slowly.
    
4. Record them again and compare.

### 🎙️ **Mini Practice Example**

#### Try this script:

> “The squirrel climbed up the tall tree. The choir was singing beautifully. She gave the answer with enthusiasm.”

🔁 Record yourself reading this.  
📍 Then ask:

- Did I pronounce _squirrel_ clearly?
    
- Did I drop any silent letters (e.g., _answer_)?
    
- Did I sound **bored** or **enthusiastic**?
