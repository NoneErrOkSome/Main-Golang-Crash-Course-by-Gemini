Based on the whiteboard content and the full transcript, we can organize the course into **7 core parts**, matching the structure shown on the board and elaborated in the transcript. Each part corresponds to one numbered principle or focus area for pronunciation improvement. Here's how we can break it down:

---

### 游릴 **Part 1: Read Aloud with Enthusiasm**

- Practice repeating words difficult to pronounce and spell
    
- Example: _squirrel_, _answer_
    
- Emphasize enjoyment and passion while reading
    

---

### 游릴 **Part 2: Record and Listen to Yourself**

- Self-monitoring through audio/video recordings
    
- Identify and fix personal pronunciation issues
    
- Reflective learning from your own speech
    

---

### 游릴 **Part 3: Focus on Vowel & Consonant Sounds**

- Use **minimal pairs** (e.g., _thy_ vs _thigh_, _pool_ vs _Paul_)
    
- Study problem sounds: voiced/unvoiced, long/short vowels, diphthongs
    
- Practical exercises: dictionaries with audio, phonetic charts
    

---

### 游릴 **Part 4: Do as Much Listening as Possible**

- Listen to music, movies, conversations, poetry
    
- Passive and active listening for speech rhythm and sound identification
    
- Emphasize silent letters in spoken words (e.g., _listen_, _womb_)
    

---

### 游릴 **Part 5: Do as Much Speaking as Possible**

- Repeat difficult sentences
    
- Use **tongue twisters** and poetic recitations
    
- Practice with enthusiasm and expression
    
- Examples: _Roger the Warrior_, _rural brewery_, _tractor_
    

---

### 游릴 **Part 6: Focus on Weird Spelling and Silent Letters**

- English spelling-pronunciation mismatch (e.g., _colonel = kernel_, _choir = fire_)
    
- Learn patterns: _mb = m only_ (e.g., _thumb_, _womb_)
    
- Homophones and rhyming patterns (e.g., _persuade_ / _pervade_)
    

---

### 游릴 **Part 7: Focus on Word Stress**

- Learn correct stress in long words and word pairs (e.g., _to refuse_ vs _some refuse_)
    
- Use dictionaries, songs, poetry, and **graded readers** for practice
    
- Visual marking of stress in texts

If you'd like, I can turn each part into:

- A structured HTML lesson
    
- Practice exercises (e.g., minimal pair cards, stress marking texts)
    
- Anki flashcards
    
- A printable cheat sheet summary
