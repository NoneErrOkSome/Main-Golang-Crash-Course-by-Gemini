### 🟠 Sentence 1

> **He mouthed me the answer under his breath.**  
> _(Repeat 3x with increasing speed)_

|Word|Sound|Voicing|IPA|
|---|---|---|---|
|mouthed|/ð/|Voiced|/maʊðd/|
|breath|/θ/|Voiceless|/brɛθ/|

✅ _mouthed_ = verb = voiced /ð/  
✅ _breath_ = noun = voiceless /θ/

---

### 🟠 Sentence 2

> **He is loath to admit that he loathes thy clothes.**  
> _(Repeat 3x with contrast emphasis: loath vs loathes)_

|Word|Sound|Voicing|IPA|
|---|---|---|---|
|loath|/θ/|Voiceless|/ləʊθ/|
|loathes|/ð/|Voiced|/ləʊðz/|
|thy|/ð/|Voiced|/ðaɪ/|
|clothes|/ð/|Voiced|/kləʊðz/|

✅ _loath_ = adjective = voiceless  
✅ _loathes_, _thy_, _clothes_ = all voiced

### 🟠 Sentence 3

> **Breathe through your mouth, though. Don’t bathe in your clothes.**  
> _(Say slowly, then naturally)_

|mouth|/θ/|Voiceless|/maʊθ/|
|though|/ð/|Voiced|/ðəʊ/|
|bathe|/ð/|Voiced|/beɪð/|

|Verb or Noun?|Verb → voiced /ð/|
|Tongue position|Between teeth for **every** TH|
|Voicing test|Finger on throat → **buzz only for /ð/**|
|Final sound clarity|Avoid blending into _s/z/f/v_|
