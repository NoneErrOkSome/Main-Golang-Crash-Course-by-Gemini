### 🟧 2.4 – Tongue Placement & Mouth Position

---

#### 🎯 Goal

To **physically produce** the correct /θ/ (voiceless) and /ð/ (voiced) sounds clearly and consistently.

---

### 🦷 Tongue & Teeth Mechanics

|Feature|Voiceless /θ/|Voiced /ð/|
|---|---|---|
|**Tongue position**|Tip of tongue **lightly between teeth**|Same position as /θ/|
|**Teeth**|Slightly apart|Slightly apart|
|**Airflow**|Continuous, no vibration|Continuous, **with vibration**|
|**Vocal cords**|❌ Silent (no vibration)|✅ Engaged (vibrates)|

➡️ _Important:_ Both sounds are **interdental** — the tongue must **touch or slightly stick out between the teeth**.

---

### ❌ Common Mistakes

|Mistake|Why it happens|Incorrect Substitution|
|---|---|---|
|Tongue stays inside|Sounds like _S_ or _Z_|_"sink"_ for _"think"_|
|Lip touches teeth|Sounds like _F_ or _V_|_"fink"_ for _"think"_|
|No vibration when needed|Voiced /ð/ becomes voiceless /θ/|_"tank"_ for _"thank"_|
|Vibration added to /θ/|Voiceless becomes voiced|_"thenk"_ for _"think"_|

### 🧪 Tactile Feedback Tips

✅ To test if you are **voicing**:

- Put your fingers on your throat while saying the sound:
    
    - **/θ/** – no buzz
        
    - **/ð/** – slight buzz
        

✅ To check **tongue position**:

- Use a **mirror** to see the tongue **lightly visible** between teeth
    
- It should not poke out far, but must **break the seal**

### 🗣 Drill Sentences (Tongue Focus)

> He **mouthed** the answer with his **mouth**.  
> I am **loath** to admit I **loathe** bad pronunciation.  
> They **clothe** the baby in soft **cloth**.

Repeat slowly, ensuring:

- **/θ/** = air only
    
- **/ð/** = soft buzz

### 🧠 Practice Strategy

|Activity|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Mirror practice|Visual check of **tongue position**|
|Finger-on-throat test|Check for **vibration in voiced /ð/**|
|Audio recording|Detect **substitution errors**|
|Slow repetition|Build mouth muscle memory|
