### ðŸŸ§ PART 3: Position of TH in Words

- TH at the **beginning**:
    
    - Voiced (e.g. _the, them, those_) = determiners, pronouns
        
    - Voiceless (e.g. _think, thin, thought_) = nouns, adjectives, verbs
        
- TH in the **middle**:
    
    - Voiceless before consonants (e.g. _toothpick, bathtub_)
        
    - Voiced between vowels (e.g. _mother, brother_)
        
    - Common exceptions (e.g. _something, nothing, anything_)
        
- TH at the **end**:
    
    - Usually voiceless (e.g. _mouth_)
        
    - Exceptions = **voiced when verb** (e.g. _breathe_, _bathe_)
