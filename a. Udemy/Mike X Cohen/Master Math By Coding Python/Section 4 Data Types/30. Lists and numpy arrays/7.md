# 🧠 Part 7: Formatting Types Cleanly Using `str()`, Slicing, and `.find()`

---

## 🧪 The Problem

When using `type()` in a print statement:

```python
type(3) → <class 'int'>
```

That looks **cluttered**. We want to extract just `"int"` — not the full `<class 'int'>` string.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Convert Type to String

```python
t = str(type(item))
print(t)
# Output: "<class 'int'>"
```

Now `t` is a **regular string** and we can slice or search it.

---

## ✂️ Step 2: Use Slicing

We know the first 8 characters (`<class '`) are useless, and the last 2 (`'>`) too:

```python
clean_type = t[8:-2]
print(clean_type)
# Output: int
```

Works for all types — `int`, `float`, `list`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Use `.find()` to Dynamically Trim (Optional)

Instead of slicing fixed positions, you can find the `'` dynamically:

```python
start = t.find("'") + 1
end = t.find("'", start)
clean_type = t[start:end]
```

This method:

- Finds the first `'`
    
- Finds the closing `'`
    
- Extracts whatever is between them
    

Result is still:

```python
'int', 'list', 'float', etc.
```

---

## 📦 Full Example Using `.find()`

```python
list_list = [3, ['three', 'four'], 5.5, [1, 2, 3]]

for i, item in enumerate(list_list):
    t = str(type(item))
    start = t.find("'") + 1
    end = t.find("'", start)
    clean_type = t[start:end]
    
    print(f"List element {i} is {item} and is of type {clean_type}")
```

---

## 🎯 Final Output (Clean and Human-Readable)

```
List element 0 is 3 and is of type int
List element 1 is ['three', 'four'] and is of type list
List element 2 is 5.5 and is of type float
List element 3 is [1, 2, 3] and is of type list
```

## 🧠 Summary

|Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|`str(type(x))`|Converts type object to string|
|`slicing`|Cuts out `<class '` and `'`|
|`.find()`|Dynamically locates quote positions|
|F-string|Prints clean, readable output|
