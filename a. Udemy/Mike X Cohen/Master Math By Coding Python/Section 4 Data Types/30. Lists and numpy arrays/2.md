# 🔢 Part 2: List Operations — Addition, Multiplication, and Concatenation

---

## ➕ `list + list` → Concatenation

Python allows **adding two lists**, which means **combining** them:

```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
s_list = ['1', '2', '3']

combined = a_list + s_list
print(combined)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, '1', '2', '3']
```

- This **does not** add numbers — it **concatenates elements** from both.
    
- Result is a new list containing all elements from both lists.

## 🔁 `list + list` (same list twice)

```python
print(a_list + a_list)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

---

## ✖️ `list * n` → Repetition

Multiplying a list by a number **repeats** it that many times:

```python
print(s_list * 3)
# Output: ['1', '2', '3', '1', '2', '3', '1', '2', '3']
```

This is **not mathematical multiplication** — it repeats the sequence of elements.

---

## ⚠️ Not Element-wise Math

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3]

# This does NOT multiply each element by 3
print(num_list * 3)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

> It **repeats** the whole list — it does **not** give `[3, 6, 9]`.

## 🔄 Expected Behavior vs Actual

|Operation|Expected Math?|Actual Python Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|`[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]`|Element-wise sum? ❌|Concatenation ✔️|
|`[1, 2, 3] * 2`|Multiply items? ❌|Repetition ✔️|

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Operation|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`+` with lists|Join elements|
|`*` with list + int|Repeat full list|
|No element-wise math|Use NumPy instead|
