# 🔁 Part 6: Exercise — Looping Through List with Index and Type

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Exercise

Create a **loop** that goes through a nested list and prints:

- The **index** of each element
    
- The **value** of that element
    
- The **type** of the element (as a string, like `"int"` or `"list"`)
    

---

## 📦 Sample Input List

```python
list_list = [
    3,                          # int
    ['three', 'four', 'five'], # list of strings
    5.5,                        # float
    [1, 2, 3]                   # list of ints
]
```

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution

### 🧪 Step 1: Basic Loop (no index)

```python
for item in list_list:
    print(item)
```

---

### 🔁 Step 2: Use `enumerate()` to Get Index + Value

```python
for index, item in enumerate(list_list):
    print(f"List element {index} is {item} and is of type {type(item)}")
```

Sample output:

```
List element 0 is 3 and is of type <class 'int'>
List element 1 is ['three', 'four', 'five'] and is of type <class 'list'>
List element 2 is 5.5 and is of type <class 'float'>
List element 3 is [1, 2, 3] and is of type <class 'list'>
```

---

### ✨ Step 3: Clean Up the Type String

By default, `type(item)` returns:

```python
<class 'int'>
```

To extract just `"int"`:

```python
t = str(type(item))       # convert to string
clean_type = t[8:-2]      # slice to remove "<class '" and "'>"
```

Now update the print:

```python
for index, item in enumerate(list_list):
    t = str(type(item))
    clean_type = t[8:-2]
    print(f"List element {index} is {item} and is of type {clean_type}")
```

Output:

```
List element 0 is 3 and is of type int
List element 1 is ['three', 'four', 'five'] and is of type list
List element 2 is 5.5 and is of type float
List element 3 is [1, 2, 3] and is of type list
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

|Concept|Usage|
|---|---|
|`enumerate()`|Loop with both index and value|
|`type(x)`|Shows data type|
|`str(...)`|Convert any object to string|
|`string[8:-2]`|Slice to extract type name cleanly|
