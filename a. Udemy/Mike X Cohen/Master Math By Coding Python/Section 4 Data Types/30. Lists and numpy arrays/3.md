# 💡 Part 3: Introducing NumPy Arrays & Type Comparison

---

## 📦 Why NumPy?

- Python lists are **flexible**, but they don’t support element-wise math directly.
    
- For numerical operations, Python programmers use the **NumPy** library, which introduces a new data type:  
    **`numpy.ndarray`** (NumPy array).

## ✅ Converting a List to a NumPy Array

```python
import numpy as np

a_list = [3, 4, 5]
a_array = np.array(a_list)
```

Now:

```python
type(a_list)   # <class 'list'>
type(a_array)  # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

> Even though both look similar, they are **not the same**.

## 🔍 Print Comparison

```python
print(a_list)   # [3, 4, 5]
print(a_array)  # [3 4 5]
```

- They look almost the same at a glance
    
- But:
    
    - **Python list** uses commas between items
        
    - **NumPy array** omits commas and has different formatting internally

## 🧪 Important Differences

|Feature|Python List|NumPy Array|
|---|---|---|
|Type|`list`|`numpy.ndarray`|
|Math operations|Not element-wise|Element-wise supported|
|Printing style|With commas|Without commas|
|Best for|Flexibility, mixed types|Fast numeric computation|

## 🔄 Recap: Creating NumPy Array from List

```python
import numpy as np

a_list = [1, 2, 3]
a_array = np.array(a_list)
```

- This **does not change the values**
    
- But it **changes the behavior of operators**, which we’ll explore next
