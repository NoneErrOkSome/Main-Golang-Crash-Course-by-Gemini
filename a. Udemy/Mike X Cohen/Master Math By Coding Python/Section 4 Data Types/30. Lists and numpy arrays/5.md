# 🔄 Part 5: Addition & Error Handling Between Lists and Scalars

---

## ➕ Can You Add a Scalar to a Python List?

```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
a_list + 3
# ❌ TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
```

- Python lists **cannot** directly add an integer (or float).
    
- This is interpreted as **concatenation**, and you're trying to concatenate an `int` to a `list` — which is invalid.
    

---

## ✅ How to Fix: Wrap Scalar in a List

```python
a_list + [3]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 3]
```

> Wrapping `3` in square brackets turns it into a **list of one element**, so Python allows concatenation.

---

## ➕ NumPy Array Allows Scalar Addition

```python
import numpy as np

a_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
a_array + 3
# Output: [4 5 6]
```

- NumPy automatically applies the scalar to **each element** (element-wise addition).
    
- This is part of **NumPy broadcasting**.

## 🔍 List vs NumPy Array Addition Summary

|Operation|Python List|NumPy Array|
|---|---|---|
|`list + 3`|❌ TypeError|N/A|
|`list + [3]`|✔ Concatenation|❌ (Shape error, unless dimensions match)|
|`array + 3`|❌ Not supported|✔ Element-wise addition|

---

## ⚠️ Edge Case: Misaligned Addition in NumPy

```python
a_array + np.array([3])
# Output: [4 5 6] — broadcasting works

a_array + np.array([3, 4])
# ❌ ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together
```

> NumPy requires dimensions to **match or be broadcast-compatible**.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Python lists can't mix data types with math operators.
    
- NumPy arrays are built for scalar operations and broadcasting.
    
- When in doubt, check the **type** of your variable (`type(x)`).
