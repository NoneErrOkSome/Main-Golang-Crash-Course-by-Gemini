# 🧩 Part 1: Lists Refresher & Flexible Nesting

---

## 📘 What is a Python List?

- A **list** is a built-in Python data type used to store **collections of items**.
    
- Lists use **square brackets `[]`** and items are separated by **commas**.
    

### Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
type(my_list)  # <class 'list'>
```

## 🔁 Lists Can Be Nested and Mixed

A list can contain **other lists** and **mixed data types** (e.g. strings, floats, ints):

```python
list_list = [
    3,                     # int
    ['three', 'four', 'five'],  # list of strings
    5.5,                  # float
    [1, 2, 3]             # list of ints
]
```

> This is called a **nested list** (a list containing other lists).

## 👁️‍🗨️ Why Use Multiline Formatting?

The same list can be written as a **single line** or a **multiline structure**:

### One-line version:

```python
list_list = [3, ['three', 'four', 'five'], 5.5, [1, 2, 3]]
```

### Multiline version (same value, better readability):

```python
list_list = [
    3,                             # a number
    ['three', 'four', 'five'],    # a list of strings
    5.5,                           # a float
    [1, 2, 3]                      # a list of integers
]
```

- **For Python**, both are identical.
    
- **For humans**, the multiline version:
    
    - is easier to read
        
    - allows inline **comments**
        
    - improves debugging and maintainability
