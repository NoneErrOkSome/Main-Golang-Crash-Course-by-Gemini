# 🧩 Part 1: Introduction to Data Types in Python

---

## 🎯 **Goal of This Section**

- Understand **Python data types** in a math-focused course.
    
- Avoid confusion or bugs later when working with variables and functions.
    

---

## 🗣️ **Teaching Style**

- This course takes a **nontraditional approach**:
    
    - Learn Python **through math topics**
        
    - Avoid the "textbook-style" programming lectures
        
- However, **basic data types** need to be understood formally for:
    
    - Preventing code errors
        
    - Writing clear, bug-free math + Python logic

## 📦 What Are Data Types?

- Data types define **what kind of value** a variable holds.
    
- Python has **dozens** of data types, but we focus on the **core ones**:
    
    - `int` (integer)
        
    - `float` (decimal)
        
    - `str` (string)
        

---

## ✅ Why Do Data Types Matter?

- Python behavior **depends on the type** of variable.
    
- Some functions like `range()` **only accept integers**.
    
- Different data types affect:
    
    - Which functions you can use
        
    - How operations behave (e.g., `+`, `*`)
        
    - How variables interact with math

## 🚨 Example of a Real Problem

Trying to do this:

```python
for i in range(7.0):  # float value
    print(i)
```

You’ll get this error:

```
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

Why? Because `range()` **requires an `int`**, not a `float`.

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> You may **look at `7` and `7.0` as the same**,  
> but Python **treats them as different types**: `int` vs `float`.
