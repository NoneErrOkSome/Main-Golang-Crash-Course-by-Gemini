# ✖️ Part 4: Operator Overloading with `*` – Multiply Numbers vs Strings

---

## 🧮 Multiplying Numbers

Basic arithmetic:

```python
c = 7
d = 7.0

print(c * d)  # 49.0
```

- One value is `int`, the other is `float`
    
- Python promotes result to `float` → `49.0`

## 🧵 Multiplying Strings

What happens if we multiply a **string**?

```python
name = "Mike"
print(name * 3)
# Output: MikeMikeMike
```

- `*` with a string and int means **repetition**
    
- `"Mike" * 3` = `"Mike" + "Mike" + "Mike"`

## 🤯 Why This Works – Operator Overloading

> **Operator overloading** = same symbol, different meaning depending on data type.

|Operator|Types|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`*`|`int * float`|multiplication|
|`*`|`str * int`|string replication|

This is Python’s way of **reusing operators** for different purposes based on **context**.

## 📌 Equivalent Behavior with Concatenation

```python
first_name = "Mike"

print(first_name * 3)
# Same as:
print(first_name + first_name + first_name)
```

So:

- `*` on `str` means "repeated concatenation"

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- `*` works differently for numbers and strings
    
- Operator behavior depends on data type
    
- This is called **operator overloading**
    
- Useful and intuitive once you know the pattern
