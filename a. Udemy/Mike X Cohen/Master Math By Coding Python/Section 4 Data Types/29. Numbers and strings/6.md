# 🔍 Part 6: Debugging Tools & Summary

---

## 🧰 Using `%whos` in Jupyter

In a Jupyter Notebook, you can type:

```python
%whos
```

This will display a **list of all variables** in memory, showing:

- **Variable name**
    
- **Type**
    
- **Value (or summary)**
    
- **Size or shape** (if large)
    

✅ Useful for quickly checking **what data types you're working with**.

---

## 🧠 Why Type Awareness Matters

Understanding data types helps avoid errors like:

```python
range(5.0)   # ❌ TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

Fix by converting type:

```python
range(int(5.0))  # ✅ Works
```

Or:

```python
int('4.7')  # ❌ invalid literal
float('4.7')  # ✅ 4.7
```

## 📌 Summary of Type Functions

|Conversion Direction|Function|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|String → Integer|`int('4')`|Only works if string is a whole number|
|String → Float|`float('4.7')`|Accepts decimal strings|
|Float → Integer|`int(4.7)`|Truncates (drops decimal part)|
|Number → String|`str(5.8)`|Useful for display, joining, and output formatting|

---

## 🧠 Operator Overloading Reminder

|Operation|On Numbers|On Strings|
|---|---|---|
|`+`|Addition|Concatenation (joining)|
|`*`|Multiplication|Repetition (repeat string)|

Same symbol, different result — depends on **data type**!

---

## 🏁 Final Notes

- Python is **flexible**, but strict about types where needed.
    
- Explicit type conversion helps prevent confusing errors.
    
- Always inspect with `type()` or `%whos` to debug.
