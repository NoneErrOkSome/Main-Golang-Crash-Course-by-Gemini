# 🧵 Part 3: Strings – Basics and Type Inspection

---

## 📘 What is a String?

- A **string** (`str`) is a sequence of characters (text).
    
- Defined using **quotes** (`' '` or `" "`).
    
- Can include:
    
    - Letters
        
    - Numbers (as characters)
        
    - Symbols, whitespace, etc.
        

### 🧪 Example:

```python
first_name = 'Mike'
last_name = 'Cohen'
```

---

## 🧪 Check the Type

```python
type(first_name)  # <class 'str'>
```

- Python reports that the variable is of type **string**.
    

---

## ➕ String Concatenation (Addition)

```python
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)  # 'MikeCohen'
```

You can **combine strings** using `+`.  
But there's **no automatic space**, so add it manually:

```python
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
# 'Mike Cohen'
```

---

## 🔁 String Multiplication (Repetition)

You can multiply a string by an integer:

```python
print(first_name * 3)
# Output: 'MikeMikeMike'
```

This creates **repetition** — the string is **repeated** N times.

---

## 🔁 Why Does This Work?

> Python uses **operator overloading**.

|Operation|Data Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`+`|numbers|addition|
|`+`|strings|concatenation|
|`*`|numbers|multiplication|
|`*`|string × int|repetition (replication)|

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- `str` means **text** data
    
- Use `+` for joining (concatenation)
    
- Use `*` to repeat a string
    
- Use `type(...)` to inspect the data type
    
- Behavior of operations **depends on data type**
