# 🔢 Part 2: Numbers – `int` vs `float`

---

## 📚 What is an Integer (`int`)?

- Whole numbers: no decimal point
    
- Can be **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**
    
- Examples:
    
    ```python
    c = 7
    type(c)  # <class 'int'>
    ```
    

---

## 🌊 What is a Float (`float`)?

- A number that **includes a decimal point**
    
- Used for **fractions**, **non-whole** values
    
- Example:
    
    ```python
    d = 7.0
    type(d)  # <class 'float'>
    ```

## 🔍 Python Sees Them as Different

```python
print(c == d)       # True (numerical value)
print(type(c))      # int
print(type(d))      # float
```

Even though `7` and `7.0` look equal in math, Python treats them as **different data types**.

## ⚙️ Why It Matters — Example with `range()`

```python
range(c)  # works: c is int

range(d)  # ❌ Error: float object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

> `range()` **only accepts** `int` types — not `float`.

This is one of the **most common beginner errors** when mixing numeric types.

---

## 🧪 Type Promotion: Mixing `int` and `float`

```python
c + d      # 14.0 → float
c * d      # 49.0 → float
```

- If either operand is `float`, Python will **promote** the result to `float`.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Concept|Result|
|---|---|
|`int` is for whole numbers|`7`, `-1`, `0`|
|`float` is for decimals|`7.0`, `-2.5`, `3.14`|
|`range()` needs `int`|`range(5)` ✔️ vs `range(5.0)` ❌|
|Mixing `int + float` → `float`|`3 + 2.5 → 5.5`|
