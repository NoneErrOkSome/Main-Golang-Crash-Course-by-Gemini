Here is **Part 2: Expression Simplification with `simplify()` and `cancel()`**, written with **adjustable coefficients** and fully formatted for **SymPy + Obsidian LaTeX**. You can change the values at the top to generate different expressions and immediately see how simplification behaves.

## ðŸ“¦ Part 2 â€“ Simplification vs Cancel on Rational Expressions (Adjustable)

---

### ðŸ”§ Python Setup (Adjustable Version)

```python
import sympy as sym
from IPython.display import display, Math

# Define symbol
q = sym.Symbol("q")

# === Adjustable Coefficients ===
# (a*q + b)(q**2 + c) / q**exp
a, b = 2, 3      # First binomial: a*q + b
c = -5           # Second factor: q^2 + c
exp = 3          # Denominator: q^exp

# === Build Rational Expression ===
numerator = (a*q + b)*(q**2 + c)
denominator = q**exp
expr = numerator / denominator

# === Display Original Expression ===
display(Math(fr"\Large \frac{{({a}q + {b})(q^2 {c:+})}}{{q^{exp}}}"))

# === Simplify the Expression ===
simplified = sym.simplify(expr)
display(Math(fr"\Large {sym.latex(simplified)}"))

# === Apply Cancel Function ===
cancelled = sym.cancel(expr)
display(Math(fr"\Large {sym.latex(cancelled)}"))
```

### ðŸ§¾ Default Expression:

With default values:

$$ \Large \frac{(2q + 3)(q^2 - 5)}{q^3} \Rightarrow \text{Simplify: same} \quad \text{Cancel: } \frac{3q^5 + 2q^4 - 5q^2 - 4}{q^3} $$

---

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:

- `simplify()` attempts structural simplification but wonâ€™t always expand or reduce.
    
- `cancel()` rewrites the entire expression as a single rational term.
