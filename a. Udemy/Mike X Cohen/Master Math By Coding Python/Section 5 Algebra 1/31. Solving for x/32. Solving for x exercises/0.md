To **cover all the details** from both the **transcript** and the **PDF files** (`solve4x.pdf` and its duplicate), and to match your preferred LaTeX-in-Obsidian style, the full content should be broken down into **6 structured parts**, as follows:

---

## âœ… Suggested Structure: 6-Part Series

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Setup and First Equation â€“ Solve for $q$**

- Equation:  
    $\Large \frac{3q + 4}{q + 3} = \frac{5q - 1}{q - 1}$
    
- Tasks:
    
    - Convert to homogeneous form
        
    - Use `sym.simplify()`
        
    - Solve for $q$
        
- PDF Code reference: `cell [8]` from both PDFs
    
- Final solution: $q = \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}$

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Expression Simplification with `simplify()` and `cancel()`**

- Expression:  
    $\frac{(2q + 3)(q^2 - 5)}{q^3}$
    
- Tasks:
    
    - Use `sym.simplify()` to show no simplification
        
    - Use `sym.cancel()` to convert to a single rational form
        
- PDF Code reference: `cell [9]`
    
- Explanation of how numerator becomes a quintic (e.g., $3q^5 + 2q^4 - 5q^2 - 4$)

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Square Root Rational Expression and Substitution**

- Expression:  
    $\frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{15}q}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{10}q}$
    
- Tasks:
    
    - Display original expression
        
    - Use `subs()` to plug in values for $q$
        
    - Use `.evalf()` to get numeric results
        
- PDF Code reference: `cell [10]`, `cell [11]`, and `cell [12]`
    
- Simplified result: $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \approx 1.2247$

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 4: Why $q$ Cancels Out in the Square Root Expression**

- Explanation:
    
    - Factor out common terms:  
        $\sqrt{3}(1 + \sqrt{5}q)$, etc.
        
    - Cancel terms
        
    - Rationalize denominator
        
- Final simplification: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 5: Recap â€” Tools and Patterns Used**

- Commands learned:
    
    - `sym.solve()`
        
    - `sym.latex()`
        
    - `display(Math(...))`
        
    - `simplify()`, `cancel()`
        
    - `subs()`, `evalf()`
        
- Tips:
    
    - All solve results come as lists
        
    - Use homogeneous form
        
    - Use `.evalf()` when symbolic evaluation is not enough

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 6: Practice Exercises with Solutions (from the PDF)**

- Directly from `solve4x.pdf`, include code cells:
    
    - Solve $2x + 4 = 9$
        
    - Solve $x^2 - 4 = 0$
        
    - Solve $x/4 - xy + 5 = 0$ for both $x$ and $y$
        
- Reinforce list-based solution unpacking with indexing
