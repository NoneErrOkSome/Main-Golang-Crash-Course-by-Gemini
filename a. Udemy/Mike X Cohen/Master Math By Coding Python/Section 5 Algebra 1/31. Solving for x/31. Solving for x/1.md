## 🧮 Part 1 – What It Means to Solve for a Variable

### 📌 Purpose

This part introduces the **core idea of algebra** — solving for a variable like xx. It emphasizes what it means to isolate a variable and how this applies whether the equation contains numbers, variables, or even complex expressions.

---

### 🧠 Conceptual Definition

To **solve for a variable** means to:

- **Isolate** that variable on one side of the equation
    
- Apply valid algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, etc.)
    
- Express the solution in terms of constants or other variables
    

---

### 🔢 Simple Example

Given:

$$ \Large 4x = 2 $$

To solve for xx:

$$ \Large x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $$

You isolate xx by dividing both sides by 4.

---

### 🔁 Example with Multiple Variables

Given:

$$ \Large -4x^2 = y^{1/3} $$

Solving for xx:

$$ \Large x = \pm 2i \cdot y^{1/6} $$

- You get an **imaginary number** due to the square root of a negative
    
- The solution is expressed in terms of another variable yy
    
- This introduces **complex numbers** and **rational exponents**
    

---

### 🔄 Solving for the Other Variable

If solving for yy instead:

$$ \Large y = (-4x^2)^3 = -64x^6 $$

You raise both sides to the **cube** to cancel out the 1/3 exponent.

### 🟨 Key Concept: Homogeneous Form

Before using SymPy:

- Algebraic equations should be **set equal to 0**
    
- This is called the **homogeneous form**
    

Example:

From:

$$ \Large 2x + 4 = 9 $$

We write:

$$ \Large 2x + 4 - 9 = 0 $$

This form is what `sym.solve()` expects by default.

### ✅ Summary

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|Solving for x|Isolate xx using inverse operations|
|Variable isolation|Works with numeric or symbolic expressions|
|Homogeneous form|Move all terms to one side: =0= 0|
|Supports multiple variables|Solutions may involve other variables (e.g. xx in terms of yy)|
|Complex solutions|May include ii, roots, exponents|
