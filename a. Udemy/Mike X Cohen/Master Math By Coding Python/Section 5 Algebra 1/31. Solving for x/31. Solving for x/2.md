## 🔁 Part 2 – Turning Equations into Homogeneous Form for SymPy

### 📌 Purpose

Before using SymPy to solve equations, we must first convert them into a **homogeneous form** — where the entire equation is expressed as an expression set **equal to zero**.

---

### 🧠 What is Homogeneous Form?

An equation in **homogeneous form** looks like:

$$ \Large \text{expression} = 0 $$

Rather than using:

$$ \Large 2x + 4 = 9 $$

We rewrite it as:

$$ \Large 2x + 4 - 9 = 0 $$

---

### 💻 SymPy Interpretation

SymPy's `solve()` function is usually given just the **left-hand side**, assuming the right-hand side is 0.

#### ✅ Correct SymPy input:

```python
expr = 2 * x + 4 - 9
sym.solve(expr)
```

Which tells SymPy:

$$ \Large 2x + 4 - 9 = 0 $$

---

### 🔎 Why This Matters

- Most symbolic solvers, including SymPy, expect equations in the form:
    
    $$ \Large f(x) = 0 $$
    
- If you instead pass `sym.Eq(lhs, rhs)`, it works, but `solve()` is simpler with homogeneous expressions
    

---

### 📌 Key Takeaway

Always convert:

$$ \Large a = b $$

To:

$$ \Large a - b = 0 $$

Before passing it to `sym.solve()`.

---

### ✅ Summary

|Original Equation|Homogeneous Form|SymPy Input|
|---|---|---|
|$\Large 2x + 4 = 9$|$\Large 2x + 4 - 9 = 0$|`sym.solve(2*x + 4 - 9)`|
|$\Large x^2 = 4$|$\Large x^2 - 4 = 0$|`sym.solve(x**2 - 4)`|
