## ✨ Part 9 – Solving Equations with Multiple Solutions

### 📌 Purpose

This part explores how SymPy handles equations that have **more than one solution**, such as quadratics, and how to retrieve and display all of them.

---

### 🧪 Example: Solve a Quadratic Equation

```python
x = sym.Symbol("x")
expr = x**2 - 4
solutions = sym.solve(expr)
```

This corresponds to:

$$ \Large x^2 - 4 = 0 $$

---

### ✅ Output:

```python
[-2, 2]
```

Which represents:

$$ \Large x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 2 $$

---

### 🖨️ Displaying All Solutions

```python
for i, sol in enumerate(solutions):
    display(Math(fr"$$\Large \text{{Solution }} {i+1}: x = {sym.latex(sol)}$$"))
```

This loop:

- Enumerates the solutions
    
- Prints each nicely formatted with LaTeX
    

---

### 🔁 Why Multiple Solutions Appear

- Equations like quadratics, cubics, or trigonometric equations often have **2 or more** valid roots
    
- SymPy's `solve()` returns **all valid algebraic solutions**
    

---

### 💡 Conceptual Check

For:

$$ \Large x^2 = 4 $$

Take the square root:

$$ \Large x = \pm 2 $$

Which gives both:

- $\Large x = 2$
    
- $\Large x = -2$
    

---

### ✅ Summary Table

|Equation|Solutions|
|---|---|
|$x^2 - 4 = 0$|`[-2, 2]`|
|$x^2 + 1 = 0$|`[I, -I]` (complex)|
|$x^3 - x = 0$|`[0, 1, -1]`|
