## 🔁 Part 10 – Looping Over Solutions with `for i in range(len(...))`

### 📌 Purpose

This part demonstrates how to loop over multiple solutions returned by `sym.solve()` using a classic **`for` loop with `range()`**, useful when you need the index of each solution.

---

### 🧪 Example

```python
x = sym.Symbol("x")
expr = x**2 - 4
solutions = sym.solve(expr)
```

Returns:

```python
[-2, 2]
```

---

### ✅ Loop with `range(len(...))`

```python
for i in range(len(solutions)):
    display(Math(fr"$$\Large \text{{Solution }} {i+1}: x = {sym.latex(solutions[i])}$$"))
```

- `range(len(solutions))` iterates over the indices: `0`, `1`, ...
    
- `i + 1` is used for human-friendly numbering starting from 1
    

---

### 🧠 When to Use This Format

Use this structure when:

- You need the **index** of each solution (e.g., to label them)
    
- You want full control over loop steps or conditions
    

---

### 🆚 Comparison with `enumerate(...)`

|Approach|Syntax|Best for|
|---|---|---|
|`range(len(...))`|`for i in range(len(lst))`|Index-focused loops|
|`enumerate(...)`|`for i, val in enumerate(lst)`|Cleaner & more Pythonic|

Both are valid. Use whichever fits your coding style or clarity needs.

---

### 🛑 Common Pitfall

If the list is empty (`[]`), the loop will **not run at all**, which is fine — just make sure to handle empty results outside the loop if needed.

---

### ✅ Summary

|Pattern|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`range(len(lst))`|Iterate by index|
|`lst[i]`|Access i-th element|
|`i + 1`|Human-friendly numbering|
|`sym.latex(lst[i])`|Render result in LaTeX|
