## 🔄 Part 12 – Solving for a Variable When Multiple Variables Exist

### 📌 Purpose

This part demonstrates how to solve an equation when it contains **more than one symbolic variable**, and how to specify **which variable** to isolate using `sym.solve(expr, var)`.

---

### 🧪 Example Expression with Two Variables

```python
x, y = sym.symbols("x y")
expr = x / 4 - x * y + 5
```

This represents:

$$ \Large \frac{x}{4} - xy + 5 = 0 $$

---

### ❌ If You Run:

```python
sym.solve(expr)
```

SymPy will:

- Automatically pick a variable (usually the first one alphabetically or one it can solve for)
    
- But the result may not include all variables or match your intention
    

---

### ✅ Explicitly Solve for a Specific Variable

```python
sym.solve(expr, x)
```

Solves for xx in terms of yy:

$$ \Large x = \frac{20}{4y - 1} $$

---

### 🔁 Reversing the Solve: Solve for `y`

```python
sym.solve(expr, y)
```

Solves for yy in terms of xx:

$$ \Large y = \frac{x + 20}{4x} $$

(Simplified form depends on the rearrangement of the expression.)

---

### 🧠 Why This Is Important

- When dealing with multivariable expressions, always **specify** which variable you want to isolate.
    
- SymPy will return a **list of solutions** or a **list of dictionaries** if there are multiple unknowns.

### ✅ Summary Table

|Expression|Solve For|Output|
|---|---|---|
|`x / 4 - x*y + 5`|`x`|$\Large x = \frac{20}{4y - 1}$|
|`x / 4 - x*y + 5`|`y`|$\Large y = \frac{x + 20}{4x}$|
