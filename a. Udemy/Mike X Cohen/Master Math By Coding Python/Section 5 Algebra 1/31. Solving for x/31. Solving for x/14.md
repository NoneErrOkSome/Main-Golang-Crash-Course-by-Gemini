## üß© Part 15 ‚Äì Recap: When to Use Lists, Loops, and Multi-Variable Solving in SymPy

### üìå Purpose

This part summarizes the patterns and best practices you've learned for solving equations with SymPy ‚Äî especially how to handle the output, iterate through solutions, and work with multi-variable expressions effectively.

---

### ‚úÖ When Does `solve()` Return a List?

- Always ‚Äî it's the **default output structure**
    
- You must extract values using indexing or looping
    

#### Examples:

```python
sol = sym.solve(expr)
sol[0]  # first solution
```

---

### üîÅ When Should You Use a Loop?

Use a loop when:

- The equation has **multiple solutions**
    
- You want to display or process **each one individually**
    

#### Loop with Display:

```python
for i, root in enumerate(sol):
    display(Math(fr"$$\Large \text{{Solution {i + 1}}}: x = {sym.latex(root)}$$"))
```

---

### üì¶ When Does `solve()` Return a List of Dictionaries?

- When solving equations involving **multiple symbolic variables**
    
- When solving **systems of equations**
    

#### Example:

```python
eq1 = x + y - 5
eq2 = x - y - 1
sol = sym.solve([eq1, eq2])  # ‚ûú [{x: 3, y: 2}]
```

You can access each solution like:

```python
sol[0][x], sol[0][y]
```

---

### üß† Best Practices Summary

|Situation|What to Do|
|---|---|
|Single solution|`sol[0]`|
|Multiple solutions|Loop with `for i in range(...)` or `enumerate(...)`|
|Display nicely|Use `sym.latex(...)` + `Math(...)`|
|Multiple variables|Use `solve(expr, var)` to specify the target|
|System of equations|Input a list of equations into `solve([...])`|

---

### üßÆ Final Tips

- Use `len(sol)` to check the number of solutions
    
- Wrap output in `display(Math(...))` for clean rendering
    
- Use `\Large` in `$$...$$` for large, clear output in notebooks
    
- Always inspect the structure of your result with `type(...)` if unsure
