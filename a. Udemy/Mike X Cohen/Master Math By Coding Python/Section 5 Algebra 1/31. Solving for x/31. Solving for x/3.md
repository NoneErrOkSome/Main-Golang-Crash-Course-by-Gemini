## ðŸ§® Part 3 â€“ Using `sym.solve()` for Simple Linear Equations

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This part demonstrates how to use the `sym.solve()` function to find the value of a variable (e.g., xx) in a simple linear equation using SymPy.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Example: Solve 2x+4=92x + 4 = 9

First, convert it to homogeneous form:

$$ \Large 2x + 4 - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow 2x - 5 = 0 $$

---

### âœ… Step 1: Define the Symbol

```python
x = sym.Symbol("x")
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Define the Expression

```python
expr = 2 * x + 4 - 9
```

Now we have:

$$ \Large \text{expr} = 2x - 5 $$

---

### âœ… Step 3: Use `solve()`

```python
solution = sym.solve(expr)
```

This returns:

```python
[5/2]
```

Which means:

$$ \Large x = \frac{5}{2} $$

---

### ðŸ§  How SymPy Chooses the Variable

- SymPy automatically solves for **the only symbolic variable** in the expression
    
- If multiple variables are present, you must specify which one to solve for
    

---

### ðŸ“Œ Tip: Confirm by Substitution

```python
expr.subs(x, 5/2)  # Output: 0
```

âœ… Confirms that the solution satisfies the equation

---

### âœ… Summary Table

|Code|Output|
|---|---|
|`sym.solve(2*x - 5)`|`[5/2]`|
|`expr.subs(x, 5/2)`|`0`|
