## 📋 Part 4 – Understanding Why `solve()` Returns a List

### 📌 Purpose

This part explains why `sym.solve()` always returns a **list**, even when there is only **one solution**, and how to work with that list in Python.

---

### 🧠 Why Does `solve()` Return a List?

Because:

- Many algebraic equations can have **multiple solutions**
    
- Python needs a standard way to store **zero, one, or many results**
    
- Lists can handle all 3 cases flexibly
    

---

### 🧪 Example 1: One Solution

```python
x = sym.Symbol("x")
expr = 2 * x - 5
solution = sym.solve(expr)
```

Output:

```python
[5/2]
```

Even though there is just one value, it's wrapped in a list.

---

### 🧪 Example 2: Two Solutions

```python
expr = x**2 - 4
solution = sym.solve(expr)
```

Output:

```python
[-2, 2]
```

Because:

$$ \Large x^2 = 4 \Rightarrow x = \pm 2 $$

---

### 📎 Confirm the Object Type

```python
type(solution)  # <class 'list'>
```

---

### 📐 Accessing Items in the List

Use **square brackets** to access individual elements:

```python
solution[0]  # First root
solution[1]  # Second root
```

✅ Remember: Python uses **0-based indexing**

---

### 📌 Summary Table

|Case|Equation|Output|
|---|---|---|
|One root|$\Large 2x = 5$|`[5/2]`|
|Two roots|$\Large x^2 = 4$|`[-2, 2]`|
|No roots|$\Large x^2 + 1 = 0$|`[]`|
