## 🔢 Part 5 – Extracting Solutions from a List (Indexing)

### 📌 Purpose

This part explains how to extract individual solutions from the list returned by `sym.solve()` using **Python list indexing**.

---

### 🧠 Quick Review: List Indexing

Python lists are **zero-indexed**, meaning:

|Index|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`0`|First item|
|`1`|Second item|
|`2`|Third item|
|...|...|

---

### 🧪 Example: Solve a Quadratic

```python
x = sym.Symbol("x")
expr = x**2 - 4
solutions = sym.solve(expr)
```

Output:

```python
[-2, 2]
```

This is a list of two roots: −2-2 and 22

---

### 🔍 Extract Individual Roots

```python
solutions[0]  # ➜ -2
solutions[1]  # ➜ 2
```

You can assign them directly:

```python
root1 = solutions[0]
root2 = solutions[1]
```

---

### ⚠️ Watch for Index Errors

If you access an index that doesn't exist:

```python
solutions[2]  # IndexError: list index out of range
```

Always check the list length first:

```python
len(solutions)
```

---

### 📌 Tip: Use in Calculations

```python
expr.subs(x, solutions[0])  # Should return 0
expr.subs(x, solutions[1])  # Should return 0
```

✅ This confirms each root is valid

---

### ✅ Summary Table

|Expression|Result|
|---|---|
|`solutions = solve(x**2 - 4)`|`[-2, 2]`|
|`solutions[0]`|`-2`|
|`solutions[1]`|`2`|
|`len(solutions)`|`2`|
