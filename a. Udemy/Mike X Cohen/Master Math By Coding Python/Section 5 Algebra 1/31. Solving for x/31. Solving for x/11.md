## 🧾 Part 11 – Formatting Loop Output with Correct Index and Strings

### 📌 Purpose

This part shows how to format **loop output properly** in Python using string concatenation or interpolation, especially when displaying multiple solutions dynamically inside a `for` loop.

---

### 🧪 Base Example

```python
solutions = [-2, 2]

for i in range(len(solutions)):
    print("Solution number " + str(i) + " is " + str(solutions[i]))
```

🔴 This prints:  
`Solution number 0 is -2`  
But starting at 0 is less human-friendly.

---

### ✅ Corrected Output with Index Offset

```python
for i in range(len(solutions)):
    print("Solution number " + str(i + 1) + " is " + str(solutions[i]))
```

🟢 This prints:  
`Solution number 1 is -2`  
`Solution number 2 is 2`

---

### ✅ Recommended: Use f-Strings (Cleaner & Easier)

```python
for i in range(len(solutions)):
    print(f"Solution {i + 1}: x = {solutions[i]}")
```

Same output, easier to read and maintain.

---

### 🖨️ With LaTeX Output in Jupyter

```python
for i in range(len(solutions)):
    display(Math(fr"$$\Large \text{{Solution {i + 1}}}: x = {sym.latex(solutions[i])}$$"))
```

Displays formatted output like:

$$ \Large \text{Solution 1}: x = -2 $$

$$ \Large \text{Solution 2}: x = 2 $$

### 📌 Summary: When Building Output Inside Loops

|Task|Best Practice|
|---|---|
|Join strings|Use `+ str(...)` or `f""`|
|Format index|`i + 1` for 1-based numbering|
|Render math|Use `sym.latex(...)` inside `display(Math(...))`|
|Dynamic label|Embed variables with `f""` or `fr""`|
