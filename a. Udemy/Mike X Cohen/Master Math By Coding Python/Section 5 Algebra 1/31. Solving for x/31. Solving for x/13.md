## ⚖️ Part 13 – Using `solve(expr, x)` vs `solve(expr, y)`

### 📌 Purpose

This part compares how `sym.solve()` behaves when you **explicitly choose** which variable to isolate in an equation involving multiple variables. It demonstrates how SymPy returns different symbolic expressions depending on your target.

---

### 🧪 Reuse the Example

```python
x, y = sym.symbols("x y")
expr = x / 4 - x * y + 5
```

Represents:

$$ \Large \frac{x}{4} - xy + 5 = 0 $$

---

### ✅ Solve for xx

```python
sol_x = sym.solve(expr, x)
```

Output:

$$ \Large x = \frac{20}{4y - 1} $$

- xx is isolated in terms of yy
    

---

### ✅ Solve for yy

```python
sol_y = sym.solve(expr, y)
```

Output (rearranged form):

$$ \Large y = \frac{x + 20}{4x} $$

- yy is isolated in terms of xx
    

---

### 🔍 Interpretation

|Command|Result|Variable Solved|
|---|---|---|
|`solve(expr, x)`|expression with yy|Isolates xx|
|`solve(expr, y)`|expression with xx|Isolates yy|

SymPy rewrites the same equation from **different perspectives** depending on the solve target.

---

### ✅ Best Practice

**Always** specify the variable explicitly when:

- Working with multiple unknowns
    
- Writing general-purpose code
    
- Verifying dependencies (e.g., whether the solution includes or excludes a symbol)
    

---

### 🧠 Summary

|Goal|Syntax|
|---|---|
|Isolate xx|`sym.solve(expr, x)`|
|Isolate yy|`sym.solve(expr, y)`|
|General behavior|Changes depending on chosen variable|
