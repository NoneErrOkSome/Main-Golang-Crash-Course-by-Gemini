Here is **Part 5: `%whos` and Inspecting Workspace Symbols**, written in full detail with **raw LaTeX formatting for Obsidian** and annotated Python code. This part teaches you how to introspect your active variables and modules inside a Jupyter or IPython environment.

## ðŸ“‹ Part 5 â€“ `%whos`: Inspecting Workspace Variables and Symbols

---

### ðŸ§  What Is `%whos`?

- `%whos` is an **IPython magic command**.
    
- It shows a **summary table** of all currently defined:
    
    - Variables
        
    - Functions
        
    - Modules
        
    - Objects
        

You can use this to check which **symbolic variables** or **intermediate expressions** are loaded.

---

### âœ… Example Use

```python
%whos
```

Example output might look like:

```
Variable   Type         Data/Info
--------   ----         ---------
Math       type         <class 'IPython.core.display.Math'>
display    function     <function display at 0x...>
expanded   Add          symbolic expression (expanded form)
expr       Mul          symbolic expression (unexpanded form)
sym        module       <module 'sympy' from '...'>
term1      Add          4*x + 5
term2      Symbol       x
term3      Add          x - 7
x          Symbol       x
y          Symbol       y
z          Symbol       z
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Application in SymPy Workflow

After running multiple symbolic definitions like:

```python
from sympy.abc import x, y, z
term1 = 4*x + 5
term2 = x - 7
term3 = y - 2*z
```

You can use `%whos` to **see whatâ€™s active**:

```python
%whos
```

This tells you:

- What terms or expressions youâ€™ve created
    
- Whether variables like `x`, `y`, or `z` are defined
    
- What type of object they are (e.g., `Symbol`, `Add`, `Mul`)
    

---

### ðŸ”Ž When Is `%whos` Useful?

- After a long notebook session
    
- When debugging a name error
    
- To clean up unused definitions
    
- To explore your workspace after importing `.ipynb` code

### ðŸ“Œ Summary

|Purpose|Command|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Show all defined names|`%whos`|Tabulated workspace overview|
|Show type + data/size|âœ… Yes|Type, object, and info side-by-side|
|Works in IPython/Jupyter|âœ… Yes|Not available in pure Python script|
