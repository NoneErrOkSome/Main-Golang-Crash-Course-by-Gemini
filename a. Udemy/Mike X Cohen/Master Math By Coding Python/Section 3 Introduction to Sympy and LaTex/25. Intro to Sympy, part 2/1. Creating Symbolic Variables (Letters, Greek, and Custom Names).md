## 🔤 Part 1 – Creating Symbolic Variables (Letters, Greek, and Custom Names)

### 📌 Purpose

This part introduces how to define **symbolic variables** in SymPy, including standard single-letter variables, **Greek symbols**, and **custom names**.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Import `sympy`

Before creating any symbolic variable, always import the module:

```python
import sympy as sym
```

---

### 🔠 Step 2: Single Symbolic Variable

```python
x = sym.symbols('x')
```

- This creates a symbolic variable `x`.
    
- Not assigned a value—just a **placeholder for math**.
    

---

### 🔤 Step 3: Multiple Symbolic Variables

```python
mu, alpha, sigma = sym.symbols('mu alpha sigma')
```

- These variable names are **multi-letter** and match Greek characters.
    
- SymPy automatically renders these with **Greek LaTeX symbols** in pretty print:
    
    - `mu` → $\mu$
        
    - `alpha` → $\alpha$
        
    - `sigma` → $\sigma$
        

---

### 📌 Why Use Greek Variables?

- Greek letters are commonly used in:
    
    - Probability (e.g., $\mu$, $\sigma$ in normal distributions)
        
    - Physics (e.g., $\alpha$ decay, $\theta$ angles)
        
- SymPy treats these as **named variables**, and renders them with proper Greek letters when using:
    
    ```python
    sym.init_printing()
    ```
    

---

### 🛠 Step 4: Custom Symbolic Names

You can create **arbitrary variable names** too:

```python
hello = sym.symbols('hello')
```

Then:

```python
hello / 3
```

**Output:**

- A symbolic expression: $\frac{\text{hello}}{3}$
    

🧠 Even though “hello” has no mathematical meaning, SymPy allows it as a valid symbol.

---

### 🔁 Summary

|Type|Code|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Single letter|`x = sym.symbols('x')`|$x$|
|Greek|`mu = sym.symbols('mu')`|$\mu$|
|Multiple|`a, b = sym.symbols('a b')`|$a, b$|
|Custom|`temp = sym.symbols('temp')`|$\text{temp}$|

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- You can create symbols of **any name**, including Greek or multi-character names.
    
- Greek-letter names will be **pretty-printed** as their actual Greek symbols.
    
- All symbolic variables act as **math placeholders** — they carry no value unless substituted later.
