## 🔁 Part 4 – Substitution with `.subs()` for Single Symbolic Variables

### 📌 Purpose

This part introduces how to **evaluate symbolic expressions** by replacing symbolic variables with numerical values using the `.subs()` method from SymPy.

---

### 🧾 Step 1: Create a Symbol and Expression

```python
x = sym.symbols('x')
expr = x + 4
```

- `x` is a symbolic variable.
    
- `expr` is a symbolic expression: $x + 4$
    

---

### 🔁 Step 2: Use `.subs()` to Replace the Variable

```python
expr.subs(x, 6)   # Output: 10
```

- This replaces `x` with `6` in the expression.
    
- Result: $6 + 4 = 10$
    

```python
expr.subs(x, -4)  # Output: 0
```

- $-4 + 4 = 0$
    

---

### 📌 Method Syntax

```python
expression.subs(variable, value)
```

#### ✅ Only the specified variable is replaced.

Other symbolic variables are left untouched.

---

### 🧠 Conceptual Example

If:

$$ \text{expr} = x + 4 $$

Then:

$$ \text{expr.subs}(x, a) \Rightarrow a + 4 $$

---

### ❗ Important Notes

- `.subs()` does **not** change the original expression.
    
- It returns a **new expression or number**.
    
- You can reuse the original expression with other values.
    

---

### 💡 Tip

You can also assign the result to a variable:

```python
result = expr.subs(x, 5)
print(result)  # 9
```

---

### ✅ Summary

|Action|Code|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Create expression|`x + 4`|$x + 4$|
|Substitute x = 6|`expr.subs(x, 6)`|`10`|
|Substitute x = -4|`expr.subs(x, -4)`|`0`|
|Reuse expression|`expr` again|Still $x + 4$|
