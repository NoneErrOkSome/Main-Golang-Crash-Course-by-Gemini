To fully cover all the details, examples, and code-based learning in this video transcript, we need to break it into **11 detailed parts**. Each part focuses on a self-contained concept, demonstration, or important practice with `sympy`, `latex`, or symbolic manipulation.

### ðŸ“š Breakdown of Parts

| Part        | Title                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Part 1**  | Creating symbolic variables (letters, Greek, and custom names)           |
| **Part 2**  | Building symbolic expressions (e.g., Gaussian bell curve with `exp`)     |
| **Part 3**  | Pretty printing expressions with `display()` and `init_printing()`       |
| **Part 4**  | Substitution with `.subs()` for single symbolic variables                |
| **Part 5**  | Substituting multiple variables using dictionaries                       |
| **Part 6**  | Converting symbolic expressions to LaTeX with `sym.latex()`              |
| **Part 7**  | Using `sympify()` to convert strings to symbolic expressions             |
| **Part 8**  | Final exercise: substitution and evaluation with visual LaTeX output     |
| **Part 9**  | Formatting LaTeX with spacing (`\quad`) and arrows (`\rightarrow`)       |
| **Part 10** | Looping over substitution values and generating dynamic LaTeX output     |
| **Part 11** | Alternative syntax and flexibility in writing and evaluating expressions |

Each part is substantial, especially since it covers **both the math and the programming side** (symbolic algebra + syntax + display + automation). This structure will allow for a complete and clear note set in Obsidian or for study review.
