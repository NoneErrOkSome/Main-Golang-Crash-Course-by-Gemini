## 🧪 Part 10 – Exercise Walkthrough and Summary

### 📌 Purpose

This part reinforces everything learned by walking through four LaTeX coding exercises using `display(Math(...))` in Python and showing how to correctly structure each expression.

---

### 🧮 Exercise 1 – Algebraic Expression

**Goal:** Display  
$$\Large 4x + 5y - az = 17$$

#### ✅ Code:

```python
display(Math(r'4x + 5y - az = 17'))
```

#### 💡 Notes:

- Spacing in LaTeX math mode **doesn’t matter**.
    
- Python will display the equation as typed, with correct math formatting.
    

---

### 🌀 Exercise 2 – Trigonometric Function

**Goal:** Display  
$$ \Large \sin(2\pi f t + \theta)$$

#### ✅ Code:

```python
display(Math(r'\sin(2\pi f t + \theta)'))
```

#### ❌ Common mistake:

Typing `"sin"` instead of `\sin` results in italic letters (treated as variables).

#### 💡 Tips:

- Use LaTeX function names: `\sin`, `\cos`, `\theta`, etc.
    
- Use `\pi` for π and `\theta` for θ.

### 🔼 Exercise 3 – Famous Physics Formula

**Goal:** Display  
$$\huge E = mc^2$$

#### ✅ Code:

```python
display(Math(r'E = mc^2'))
```

#### 💡 Tip:

Use `^` for superscripts (exponents), and curly braces for multi-character powers if needed.

---

### ➗ Exercise 4 – Fraction

**Goal:** Display  
$$\large \frac{4 + 5x^2}{(1 + x)(1 - x)}$$

#### ✅ Code:

```python
display(Math(r'\frac{4 + 5x^2}{(1 + x)(1 - x)}'))
```

#### 💡 Notes:

- Wrap numerator and denominator in `{}`.
    
- Parentheses like `(1 + x)` are preserved inside the fraction.
    
- Use `x^2` for squared terms.

### ✅ Final Thoughts

#### 📘 What You’ve Learned:

- How to write and structure math in LaTeX using Python.
    
- How to display Greek symbols, roots, powers, subscripts, and fractions.
    
- How to distinguish between math rendering and actual computation.
    
- How to document equations using **markdown** or `Math(...)`.
    

#### 📌 Core Tools:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math
display(Math(r'\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}'))
```

---

You now have the full skill set to:

- Print **textbook-quality equations**
    
- Combine **text and math**
    
- Use **markdown and LaTeX** together inside your Python notebooks
