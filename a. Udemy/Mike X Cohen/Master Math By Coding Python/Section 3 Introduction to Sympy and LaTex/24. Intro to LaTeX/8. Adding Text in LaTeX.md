## 📝 Part 8 – Adding Text in LaTeX with `\text{}`

### 📌 Purpose

This part shows how to insert **normal readable text** inside LaTeX math expressions using `\text{...}`. Without this, LaTeX renders all input as math, which can lead to weird formatting.

---

### ❌ Problem: Text Looks Broken in Math Mode

#### Example:

```python
display(Math(r'The answer to this equation is 42'))
```

**Output:**

- No spacing between words
    
- All text is italicized and formatted like math variables
    

---

### ✅ Solution: Use `\text{...}`

#### Syntax:

```python
display(Math(r'\text{The answer to this equation is } 42'))
```

**Output:**

- Normal text appears with spaces
    
- Math number (like `42`) is rendered after the message
    

---

### 💡 Tip: Always Wrap Text in `{}` After `\text`

#### Correct:

```latex
\text{This is readable}
```

#### Incorrect:

```latex
\text This is readable   ← ❌ won’t compile
```

---

### 🔄 Combine Text + Math

```python
display(Math(r'\text{Let } x = 3 \text{ and } y = 2. Then } x + y = 5'))
```

**Output:**

- Text parts: “Let x = 3 and y = 2. Then”
    
- Math part: $x + y = 5$

### ✅ Summary Table

|Use|Syntax|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Embed plain text|`\text{This is a message}`|Normal readable text|
|Combine math & text|`\text{Sum: } x + y = 5`|Mix of styles|
|Use with display|`Math(r'\text{Answer is } 42')`|Proper spacing & font|
