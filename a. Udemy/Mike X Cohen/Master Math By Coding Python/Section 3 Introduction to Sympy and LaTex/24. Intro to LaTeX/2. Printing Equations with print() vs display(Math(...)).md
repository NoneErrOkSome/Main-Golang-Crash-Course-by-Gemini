## 🖨️ Part 2 – Printing Equations with `print()` vs `display(Math(...))`

### 📌 Purpose

This part compares the limitations of Python’s built-in `print()` function with the advantages of using `display(Math(...))` for rendering **mathematical expressions**.

---

### 🖨️ `print()` Function

#### 🔸 Example:

```python
print("4 + 3 = 7")
```

#### ✅ Behavior:

- Prints plain **text** only.
    
- Does **not format** expressions as math.
    
- Cannot show fractions, Greek letters, powers, or roots nicely.
    

#### ❌ Limitations:

- Expressions like `4 + 3 = 7` (without quotes) cause **syntax errors** because `=` is interpreted as assignment.
    
- Cannot render any kind of LaTeX-style formatting.
    
- No error checking—prints incorrect math if you write it (e.g., "4 + 3 = 17").

### 📐 `display(Math(...))` Function

#### 🔸 Import Required:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math
```

#### 🔸 Example:

```python
display(Math(r'4 + 3 = 7'))
```

#### ✅ Behavior:

- Renders expressions in **LaTeX math mode**.
    
- Output looks like a **typeset equation**, with clean symbols and spacing.
    
- Useful for equations, variables, fractions, Greek letters, etc.
    

---

### 🤓 Important Note

- `Math(...)` just **renders** the string—it does **not evaluate** whether it's mathematically correct.
    
- You can write: `Math(r'4 + 3 = 17')` and it will display it without error.

### ✅ Summary Table

|Method|Input|Output|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|`print()`|`"4 + 3 = 7"`|Plain text|No formatting|
|`display(Math(...))`|`Math(r'4 + 3 = 7')`|Rendered math|LaTeX-style display|
