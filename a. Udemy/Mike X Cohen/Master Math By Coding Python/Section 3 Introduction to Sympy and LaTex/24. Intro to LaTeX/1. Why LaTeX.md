## üß© Part 1 ‚Äì Why LaTeX? Motivation and Overview

### üìå Purpose

This part explains **why LaTeX is useful** for displaying mathematical expressions in Python notebooks and how it solves the limitations seen in the previous SymPy-only approach.

---

### ‚ùó Problem Recap

- SymPy expressions are simplified automatically (e.g., $\sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{x} = x$).
    
- SymPy reorders terms and does not provide full control over formatting.
    
- Standard Python syntax does not allow certain expressions (e.g., `4 + 3 = 7` causes an error due to `=` being assignment).
    

---

### ‚úÖ Why Use LaTeX?

LaTeX allows you to:

- Write **precise mathematical expressions** like $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, and equations.
    
- Insert **special characters** (e.g., Greek letters like $\sigma$, $\mu$).
    
- Maintain **exact formatting** for fractions, roots, powers, subscripts, and more.
    
- Control display behavior **without evaluation** (e.g., show $4 + 3 = 17$ without checking correctness).
    

---

### üîç Integration with Python

- You use LaTeX inside Python via:
    
    ```python
    from IPython.display import display, Math
    display(Math(r'4 + 3 = 7'))
    ```
    
- You don‚Äôt need to **know LaTeX in advance**‚Äîyou can learn it gradually through examples.

### üí° Key Idea

LaTeX is not for computing results. It's for **displaying equations beautifully** and **accurately**‚Äîmaking your math in Python **look like real math**.
