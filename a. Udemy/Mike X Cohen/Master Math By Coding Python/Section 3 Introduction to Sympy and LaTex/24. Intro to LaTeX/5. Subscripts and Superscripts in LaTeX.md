## 🔢 Part 5 – Subscripts and Superscripts in LaTeX

### 📌 Purpose

This part explains how to use **subscripts** and **superscripts** in LaTeX math expressions, and how to group multiple characters correctly using **curly braces**.

---

### 🟦 Subscripts: Using `_`

To add a subscript, use the underscore symbol `_`:

$$ x_1 $$

```python
display(Math(r'x_1'))
```

---

### ⚠️ Only One Character Is Subscripted

$$ x_mn $$ renders as:

- $x_m$ (subscript)
    
- then regular `n` (not in subscript)
    

---

### ✅ To Group Multiple Characters: Use `{}`

$$ x_{mn} $$

```python
display(Math(r'x_{mn}'))
```

This ensures **both m and n** are subscripted.

---

### 🟥 Superscripts: Using `^`

To add a superscript (power/exponent), use the caret `^`:

$$ y^2 $$

```python
display(Math(r'y^2'))
```

---

### ⚠️ Only One Character Is Superscripted by Default

$$ y^nk $$ means:

- $y^n$ (superscript)
    
- then regular `k`
    

---

### ✅ Group Multiple Characters in Superscript with `{}`

$$ y^{nk} $$

```python
display(Math(r'y^{nk}'))
```

Or even full expressions:

$$ y^{n+2k-15} $$

```python
display(Math(r'y^{n+2k-15}'))
```

---

### 🧠 Important Pattern

|Operation|Syntax|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Subscript single|`x_1`|$x_1$|
|Subscript multiple|`x_{mn}`|$x_{mn}$|
|Superscript single|`y^2`|$y^2$|
|Superscript multiple|`y^{a+b}`|$y^{a+b}$|

---

### 💡 Tip: Combine Both

$$ x_i^2 $$

```python
display(Math(r'x_i^2'))
```

This shows:

- Subscript `i`
    
- Superscript `2`
