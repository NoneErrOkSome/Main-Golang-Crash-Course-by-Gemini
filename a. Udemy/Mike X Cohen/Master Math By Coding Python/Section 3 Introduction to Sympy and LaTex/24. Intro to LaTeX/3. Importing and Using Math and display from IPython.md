## 📦 Part 3 – Importing and Using `Math` and `display` from IPython

### 📌 Purpose

This part explains how to correctly import and use the tools that allow LaTeX-style rendering in Python, particularly within Jupyter or IPython environments.

---

### ✅ Required Imports

To use LaTeX rendering, you must import two functions from IPython:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math
```

- `display(...)`: Displays rendered output in Jupyter
    
- `Math(...)`: Accepts a **LaTeX-formatted raw string** and renders it as math
    

---

### ❗ Common Mistake

If you try to run:

```python
display(Math(r'4 + 3 = 7'))
```

Without the import, you'll get:

```plaintext
NameError: name 'Math' is not defined
```

---

### 🧠 Reminder: Use Raw Strings

Always use the `r` prefix in strings to prevent Python from interpreting backslashes:

```python
Math(r'\pi')   # correct
Math('\\pi')   # incorrect unless escaped properly
```

---

### 💡 Why This Matters

|Action|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`from IPython.display import display, Math`|Enables math rendering|
|`display(Math(...))`|Renders LaTeX visually|
|`r'...'`|Raw string for LaTeX syntax|

These tools form the **foundation** for all LaTeX-integrated math visuals in Jupyter.
