## 🧩 Part 6 – Using Curly Braces for Grouping in LaTeX

### 📌 Purpose

This part explains how **curly braces `{}`** are used in LaTeX to group symbols and expressions for subscripts, superscripts, square roots, and fractions.

---

### 🔤 1. Subscripts with Curly Braces

#### ⚠️ Problem:

```latex
x_mn
```

Only `m` becomes subscripted; `n` appears as normal text.

#### ✅ Solution:

```python
display(Math(r'x_{mn}'))
```

**Output:**  
$$\Large x_{mn}$$

All characters inside the `{}` are treated as the subscript.

---

### 🔼 2. Superscripts with Curly Braces

#### ⚠️ Problem:

```latex
y^nk
```

Only `n` is superscripted.

#### ✅ Solution:

```python
display(Math(r'y^{nk}'))
```

**Output:**  
$$ \Large y^{nk}$$

You can also insert full expressions:

```python
display(Math(r'y^{n+2k-15}'))
```

**Output:**  
$$ \Large y^{n+2k-15}$$

### 🧠 3. Curly Braces in Square Roots

```python
display(Math(r'\sqrt{5x + 3z - 17u}'))
```

- The full expression inside `{}` is placed under the square root.
    
- Without `{}`, LaTeX would only include the first token.

### 🍰 Why Curly Braces Matter

| Use Case          | Syntax         | Result                |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Group subscript   | `x_{ij}`       | $\Large x_{ij}$       |
| Group superscript | `y^{ab}`       | $\Large y^{ab}$       |
| Square root       | `\sqrt{a + b}` | $\Large \sqrt{a + b}$ |

They ensure that LaTeX **treats grouped content as a unit** within formatting commands.
