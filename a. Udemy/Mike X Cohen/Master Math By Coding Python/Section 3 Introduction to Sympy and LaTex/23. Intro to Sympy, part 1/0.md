The transcript you provided is already structured into **one main section** that covers the following key content areas:

### üß† **Concepts Introduced**

1. **Symbolic Math vs. Numeric (Analytic) Math**
    
    - Symbolic: $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, etc.
        
    - Numeric: $1.4142135\ldots$, $3.1415926535\ldots$
        
2. **Computer Limitations with Numerical Computations**
    
    - Floating point approximations
        
    - Rounding errors (e.g., $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \approx 6.12 \times 10^{-17}$ instead of 0)
        
3. **SymPy Overview**
    
    - Python module for symbolic mathematics
        
    - Supports expressions like $x^y$, $\frac{x}{y}$, $\sqrt{x}$ as true symbolic forms
        

---

### üß∞ **Python Setup & Tools**

- `import sympy as sym`
    
- Creating symbols: `x = sym.symbols('x')`
    
- Multiple symbols: `x, y = sym.symbols('x y')`
    
- Pretty printing: `sym.init_printing()`
    
- IPython's `display()` for mathematical rendering
    

---

### üîÅ **Practical Demonstrations**

- Difference between:
    
    - `sym.sqrt(2)` ‚Üí Symbolic square root
        
    - `np.sqrt(2)` ‚Üí Numerical approximation
        
- Power expression: `display(x**y)`Here‚Äôs the transcript content broken into clear **Obsidian-friendly sections**, with headings, LaTeX formatting, and clean notes.

## üßÆ Symbolic vs Numeric Math

### Symbolic Math

- Example: $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$
    
- These are **symbols**, not evaluated numbers.
    
- Used when exact value is desired without approximation.
    

### Numeric Math (Analytic / Approximate)

- Calculator or Python result: $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135\ldots$
    
- $\pi \approx 3.1415926535\ldots$
    
- Computers store these as **floating-point approximations**
    

---

## üß† Limitations of Computers in Math

### Example: $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$

- Expected: $0$
    
- Actual in Python: approximately $6.12 \times 10^{-17}$
    
- Due to: floating-point rounding and internal approximation of $\pi$

## üß∞ Getting Started with `sympy`

```python
import sympy as sym
sym.init_printing()  # prettier outputs
```

### Create Symbols

```python
x = sym.symbols('x')
x, y = sym.symbols('x y')
```

- Use `sym.symbols('x y')` to create multiple symbolic variables
    

---

## üñ® Pretty-Printing in Jupyter

### Compare Results

```python
from IPython.display import display
display(x**y)       # shows x to the power y
display(x / y)      # shows x divided by y
```

- Use `display()` for nice-looking math rendering
    

---

## ‚öóÔ∏è SymPy vs NumPy (Symbolic vs Numeric)

```python
import numpy as np

display(np.sqrt(2))     # numerical approximation
display(sym.sqrt(2))    # symbolic form
```

### Output:

- NumPy: $1.41421356\ldots$
    
- SymPy: $\sqrt{2}$

## üß™ Symbolic Expression Exercises

### 1. $y \cdot x^2$

```python
display(y * x**2)
```

Result: $x^2 y$  
(SymPy reorders terms by convention.)

---

### 2. $\sqrt{4} \cdot x$

```python
display(sym.sqrt(4) * x)
```

Result: $2x$  
(SymPy evaluates $\sqrt{4} = 2$)

---

### 3. $\sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{x} = x$

```python
display(sym.sqrt(x) * sym.sqrt(x))
```

Result: $x$  
(SymPy simplifies it)

## üéì LaTeX for Full Control

- SymPy + `display()` is **not enough** for formatting every expression exactly as you want
    
- **Next step**: learn **LaTeX** to control math rendering fully
    

---

Would you like a LaTeX-only version (for raw Obsidian math block syntax) next?
    
- Fraction expression: `display(x / y)`
    
- Exercise results:
    
    - $yx^2$ became $x^2 y$
        
    - $sqrt(4)*x$ simplified to $2x$
        
    - $sqrt(x)$ $sqrt(x)$ simplified to x
        

---

### üéØ **Lesson Takeaway**

You **cannot rely solely** on SymPy + `display()` for exact visual formatting.  
‚û°Ô∏è **LaTeX** is introduced as the next step to gain full control over mathematical expression rendering.

**So the answer is:**  
üëâ You only need **one part** to summarize: the entire transcript is a single cohesive lesson.
