## ⚗️ Part 5 – SymPy vs NumPy (Symbolic vs Numeric)

### 📌 Overview

This section demonstrates the core difference between **symbolic math** (using SymPy) and **numeric math** (using NumPy) using the example of $\sqrt{2}$. It shows how to calculate and display both forms, highlighting the contrast between precision and approximation.

---

### 🔢 1. NumPy – Numeric Approximation

#### 📦 Import:

```python
import numpy as np
```

#### ✅ Example: Square Root of 2

```python
display(np.sqrt(2))
```

#### 🧾 Output:

- Approximately:  
    $1.4142135623730951$
    
- This is a **floating-point decimal approximation** of $\sqrt{2}$.
    

---

### ✳️ Why It’s Only an Approximation

- Computers cannot store irrational numbers like $\sqrt{2}$ exactly.
    
- NumPy uses floating-point math → result is **inexact but close**.
    
- Useful in applied math, science, and engineering.
    

---

### 🔁 2. SymPy – Symbolic Representation

#### 📦 Using the same display function:

```python
display(sym.sqrt(2))
```

#### 🧾 Output:

- Symbolically displayed as:  
    $\sqrt{2}$
    
- This is **not evaluated**.
    
- It remains as a symbolic object until explicitly evaluated.

### ⚖️ 3. Visual Side-by-Side Comparison

|Library|Code|Output|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|
|NumPy|`np.sqrt(2)`|$1.41421\ldots$|Numeric approximation|
|SymPy|`sym.sqrt(2)`|$\sqrt{2}$|Exact symbolic expression|

---

### 🧪 4. Why This Matters

- **SymPy** is best for learning, teaching, and exact manipulation of math.
    
- **NumPy** is best when approximate results are okay and performance matters.
    

#### ❗ Examples of SymPy Strength:

- Algebraic simplifications
    
- Calculus operations like derivatives or integrals
    
- Keeping irrational constants intact (e.g. $\pi$, $e$, $\sqrt{2}$)
    

---

### 🧠 Concept Reminder

- SymPy = Symbolic  
    $\sqrt{2}$ stays as-is
    
- NumPy = Numeric  
    $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421...$
    

Use **SymPy** when you want **mathematical purity**.  
Use **NumPy** when you want **fast calculations**.
