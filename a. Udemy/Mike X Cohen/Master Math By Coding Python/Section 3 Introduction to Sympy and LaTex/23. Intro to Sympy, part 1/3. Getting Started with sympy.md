## 🧰 Part 3 – Getting Started with `sympy`

### 📌 Overview

SymPy is a Python library for **symbolic mathematics**, allowing you to create and manipulate mathematical symbols and expressions **without numerical approximation**.

This section covers how to:

- Import SymPy
    
- Create symbolic variables
    
- Initialize pretty-printing
    

---

### 🧭 1. Importing SymPy

Before using SymPy, you must import it. The standard alias is:

```python
import sympy as sym
```

This allows you to access everything in the SymPy module with `sym.`

✅ Good Python practice: Put all import statements at the top of your notebook.

---

### ✍️ 2. Creating Symbolic Variables

#### ✅ One variable

```python
x = sym.symbols('x')
```

- `x` is now a **symbolic variable**.
    
- You have not assigned it a value — it's just “x”.
    

#### ✅ Multiple variables

```python
x, y = sym.symbols('x y')
```

- Both `x` and `y` are symbolic.
    
- You can now form expressions like `x + y`, `x * y`, etc.
    

---

### 🔍 Example: What is `x`?

```python
print(x)  # Output: x
```

- No error.
    
- `x` is known because it's defined as a symbol.
    

But:

```python
print(z)  # NameError: name 'z' is not defined
```

- `z` causes an error because it's not yet defined.
    

---

### 🖨 3. Pretty-Printing Output

SymPy expressions look better with **pretty-printing**, which formats them like traditional math.

Activate it with:

```python
sym.init_printing()
```

- Run this once per notebook.
    
- Makes fractions, powers, and roots look nicer when printed.
    

---

### ✅ What Pretty-Printing Changes

Before `init_printing()`:

```python
y + 4  →  y + 4  (plain text)
```

After `init_printing()`:

- Still `y + 4`, but now shown in **typeset math** with better font/spacing.
    

You’ll especially notice improvements with:

- Fractions: $\frac{x}{y}$
    
- Exponents: $x^y$
    
- Roots: $\sqrt{x}$

### 💡 Summary

|Task|Code|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Import SymPy|`import sympy as sym`|Load the module|
|Create variables|`x = sym.symbols('x')`|Define a symbol|
|Multiple symbols|`x, y = sym.symbols('x y')`|Define several|
|Pretty-print|`sym.init_printing()`|Make output look better|
