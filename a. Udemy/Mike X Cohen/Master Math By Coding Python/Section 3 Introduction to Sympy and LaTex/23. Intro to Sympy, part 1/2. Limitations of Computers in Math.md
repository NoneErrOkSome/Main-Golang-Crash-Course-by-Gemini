## 🧠 Part 2 – Limitations of Computers in Math

### 📌 Overview

While computers are powerful tools for numerical calculations, they **struggle with exact values** in certain mathematical computations due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic. This part explains why symbolic math is often more reliable than numeric approximations in computers.

---

### 💻 Floating-Point Numbers

Computers use a system called **floating-point representation** to store real numbers.

#### 🔣 Example:

- Python (via NumPy):
    
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    np.sqrt(2)  # Output: 1.4142135623730951
    ```
    

This is only **an approximation** of the true value of $\sqrt{2}$.

---

### 🧮 Example: Cosine of π/2

#### ✳️ What math tells us:

- $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0$
    

#### ✖️ What a computer gives:

- $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \approx 6.123233995736766 \times 10^{-17}$
    

This is **not** zero.

---

### 🧪 Why This Happens

#### ⚙️ Cause #1: π is Approximated

- Computers cannot represent $\pi$ exactly.
    
- They use an approximation like:  
    $\pi \approx 3.141592653589793$
    

#### ⚙️ Cause #2: Limited Precision

- Computers store numbers with **finite digits** (typically 15–17 decimal digits for `float64`).
    
- This leads to **rounding errors** in computation.
    

#### ⚠️ Side Effect: Scientific Notation

- When a very small number appears, it’s often printed in **scientific notation**:  
    $6.12 \times 10^{-17}$
    

---

### 🔍 What is Scientific Notation?

Scientific notation expresses very large or very small numbers concisely:

#### ✳️ Format:

- $a \times 10^b$ where:
    
    - $a$ is the **significant digits**
        
    - $b$ is the **power of 10**
        

#### ✳️ Examples:

- $6.12 \times 10^{-17}$ means:  
    Move the decimal **17 places to the left** → a very small number.
    
- $3.14 \times 10^2 = 314$
    

#### 🧠 Interpretation:

- $10^{-17} = 0.00000000000000001$
    

So $6.12 \times 10^{-17} \approx 0.0000000000000000612$

### ❗ Common Pitfalls in Computation

|Case|Expected|Actual|Why?|
|---|---|---|---|
|$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$|0|$6.12 \times 10^{-17}$|π is approximate|
|$\sqrt{2}^2$|2|1.9999999999...|Rounding during multiplication|

---

### ✅ Symbolic Math to the Rescue

Using **symbolic math**, you can avoid all of these pitfalls:

#### 🧾 Example with SymPy:

```python
import sympy as sym
x = sym.Symbol('x')
sym.cos(sym.pi / 2)  # Output: 0
```

This returns **exact zero** instead of a tiny approximate value.

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Computers **cannot store irrational numbers** like $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$ exactly.
    
- This leads to **rounding errors** in calculations.
    
- **Symbolic math** (like in SymPy) preserves mathematical accuracy and is better for algebraic work.
