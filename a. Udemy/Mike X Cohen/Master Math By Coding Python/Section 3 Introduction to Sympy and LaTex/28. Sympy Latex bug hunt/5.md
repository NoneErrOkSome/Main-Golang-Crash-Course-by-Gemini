## ‚öñÔ∏è Part 5 ‚Äì Fixing `=` vs `==` vs `Eq()` in SymPy Equations

### üìå Bug Overview

The code tried to compare two expressions using:

```python
4 * x = 2  # ‚ùå SyntaxError
```

Python throws:

```
SyntaxError: cannot assign to expression
```

---

### ‚ùå Why This Fails

- In Python, `=` is the **assignment operator**, not equality.
    
- You cannot assign a value to an expression like `4 * x`.
    

---

### üõ† Fix Option 1: Use `==` for Boolean Comparison

```python
4 * x == 2
```

This works only when `x` has a known value.

---

### üß™ Example:

```python
x = sym.Symbol('x')
x = 1/2
4 * x == 2  # ‚ûú True
```

But if `x` is still symbolic:

```python
x = sym.Symbol('x')
4 * x == 2  # ‚ûú Returns a symbolic equality expression, not a boolean
```

---

### ‚úÖ Fix Option 2: Use `sym.Eq(lhs, rhs)` for symbolic equations

```python
x = sym.Symbol('x')
sym.Eq(4 * x, 2)
```

**Output:**  
$$ 4x = 2 $$

This is a symbolic equation that you can:

- Display
    
- Solve later
    
- Manipulate algebraically
    

---

### üß† Advanced Fix: Move RHS to LHS and Set Equal to 0

```python
sym.Eq(4 * x - 2)
```

This implicitly means:

$$ 4x - 2 = 0 $$

Because the default second argument of `Eq()` is zero.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table

|Usage|Meaning|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|`=`|Assignment|`x = 2`|
|`==`|Boolean test|Only after values are known|
|`Eq(lhs, rhs)`|Symbolic equality|Always safe with symbolic variables|
|`Eq(expr)`|Sets RHS to 0|Useful for solving equations|
