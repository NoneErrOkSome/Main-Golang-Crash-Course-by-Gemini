## 🔧 Part 3 – Fixing Single vs Double Backslashes in LaTeX Strings

### 📌 Bug Overview

The code attempts to render LaTeX math manually by writing LaTeX strings inside `Math(...)`, but the result is **broken formatting** or a syntax error.

---

### ❌ Common Mistake

Using single backslashes:

```python
display(Math(r'\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{5} = x'))
```

You may see:

- Unrecognized symbols
    
- Weird spacing
    
- Or even an error in some environments
    

---

### 🛠 Fix: Use **Double Backslashes** inside Raw Strings in Python

```python
display(Math(r'\\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{5} = x'))
```

This will render properly:

$$ \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{5} = x $$

---

### 🧠 Why This Happens

- In Python, `\` is an **escape character**.
    
- `\n` → newline, `\t` → tab, etc.
    
- So `\frac` becomes a problem unless it's passed correctly.
    

Using a raw string **(`r'...'`)** helps, but LaTeX still needs **double backslashes** to survive Python’s parsing.

---

### 🧪 Corrected Example

```python
display(Math(r'\\sigma = \\mu \\cdot \\sqrt{5}'))
```

Renders:

$$ \sigma = \mu \cdot \sqrt{5} $$

---

### ✅ Summary Table

|LaTeX Intent|Python Input|Correct Output|
|---|---|---|
|`\frac{a}{b}`|`r'\\frac{a}{b}'`|$\frac{a}{b}$|
|`\sqrt{...}`|`r'\\sqrt{...}'`|$\sqrt{...}$|
|`\sigma`|`r'\\sigma'`|$\sigma$|

### 💬 Alternative: Use `sym.latex()` to Avoid Manual Errors

If you're working with SymPy expressions:

```python
display(Math(sym.latex(expr)))  # Safer, auto-formatted
```
