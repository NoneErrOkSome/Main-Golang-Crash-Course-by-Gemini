## 🔤 Part 12 – Importance of Case Sensitivity in Variable Names (`Y` vs `y`)

### 📌 Bug Overview

The code throws an error:

```
NameError: name 'Y' is not defined
```

Even though it **looks like** `y` was defined earlier in the notebook.

---

### ❌ Why This Happens

Python is a **case-sensitive** language:

- `Y` ≠ `y`
    
- `mu` ≠ `Mu` ≠ `MU`
    

---

### 🧪 Example That Fails

```python
y = sym.Symbol("y")
display(Y**2)  # ❌ NameError: 'Y' is not defined
```

---

### ✅ Correct Fix

Ensure **consistent casing**:

```python
y = sym.Symbol("y")
display(y**2)  # ✅ No error
```

---

### 🧠 Best Practice

- Always match your variable names **exactly**, including lowercase and uppercase letters
    
- Stick with lowercase for all variable names to avoid confusion:
    
    - `x`, `y`, `z` ✔️
        
    - `X`, `Y`, `Z` ❌ unless deliberately needed
        

---

### 📌 Helpful Debugging Tip

If you see:

```python
NameError: name 'X' is not defined
```

Check:

- Have you **defined** `X`?
    
- Did you **mean** lowercase `x` instead?

### ✅ Summary Table

|Variable Name|Matches?|
|---|---|
|`y` vs `Y`|❌ Different|
|`theta` vs `Theta`|❌ Different|
|`mu` vs `Mu`|❌ Different|
|`x = sym.Symbol("x")`, then `X`|❌ Error|
