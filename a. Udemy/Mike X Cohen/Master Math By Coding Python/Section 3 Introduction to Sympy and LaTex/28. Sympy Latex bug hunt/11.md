## 🧨 Part 11 – Misuse of `sym.subs()` Instead of `expr.subs(...)`

### 📌 Bug Overview

A user attempts to substitute a value into a symbolic expression using:

```python
sym.subs(x, 3)
```

This causes an error:

```
AttributeError: module 'sympy' has no attribute 'subs'
```

---

### ❌ Why This Fails

- `subs()` is a **method of symbolic expressions**, not a global function in `sympy`.
    
- You cannot call `subs` directly from the `sym` module.
    

---

### ✅ Correct Syntax

```python
expr = x**2 - 5*x + 10
result = expr.subs(x, 3)
```

- This substitutes $x = 3$ into the expression
    
- Then returns the evaluated result:
    

$$ 3^2 - 5 \cdot 3 + 10 = 9 - 15 + 10 = 4 $$

---

### 🧠 Recap: Substitution Pattern

```python
<sympy expression>.subs(variable, value)
```

---

### 🧪 Example in Context

```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt

x = symbols('x')
equation = sqrt(x**2 - 5*x + 10)
value = equation.subs(x, 3)

display(value)  # ➜ sqrt(4) = 2
```

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistake

Trying to call:

```python
sym.subs(...)
```

❌ Doesn’t work — this is not how SymPy is designed.

---

### ✅ Summary

|Task|Incorrect|Correct|
|---|---|---|
|Substitute into expr|`sym.subs(x, 3)`|`expr.subs(x, 3)`|
|Root cause|Method call on wrong object|Should be called on expression|
|Returns|Error|Substituted expression|
