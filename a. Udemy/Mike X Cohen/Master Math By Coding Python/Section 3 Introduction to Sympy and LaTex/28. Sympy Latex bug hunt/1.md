## ðŸ§© Part 1 â€“ Missing Imports: Fixing `sym` and `Math` Not Defined

### ðŸ“Œ Bug Overview

The very first cell fails to execute with an error:

```
NameError: name 'sym' is not defined
```

This means that the **SymPy module was not imported** before attempting to use it.

---

### ðŸ›  Fix Step 1: Import SymPy

```python
import sympy as sym
```

This enables access to all of SymPy's functionality using the `sym.` prefix.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Second Error: `Math is not defined`

After fixing the first error, the next line fails with:

```
NameError: name 'Math' is not defined
```

This is because the **LaTeX rendering tools** were not imported from the IPython display module.

---

### ðŸ›  Fix Step 2: Import Display Functions

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math
```

- `display(...)`: shows rich output in Jupyter Notebook
    
- `Math(...)`: renders LaTeX-formatted math strings
    

---

### âœ… Final Setup (Top of the Notebook)

```python
import sympy as sym
from IPython.display import display, Math
```

Place these at the very **top of the script** or notebook to avoid import-related errors later on.

|Problem|Fix|
|---|---|
|`sym` not defined|`import sympy as sym`|
|`Math` not defined|`from IPython.display import display, Math`|
