## 🔢 Part 4 – String Concatenation vs Integer Addition

### 📌 Bug Overview

Two variables were defined as:

```python
A = '3'
B = '4'
```

Then added together:

```python
A + B  # ➜ '34'
```

This results in **string concatenation**, not numeric addition.

---

### ❌ Why This Happens

In Python:

- `'3' + '4'` → `'34'` (concatenation of strings)
    
- `3 + 4` → `7` (numeric addition)
    

The single quotes turn numbers into strings.

---

### 🛠 Fix Option 1: Define as Integers

```python
A = 3
B = 4
A + B  # ➜ 7
```

This is the **cleanest fix** if you intend to do math with the values.

---

### 🛠 Fix Option 2: Convert Strings to Numbers

If the values must remain strings for other logic (e.g., input), convert them when needed:

```python
int(A) + int(B)     # ➜ 7
float(A) + float(B) # ➜ 7.0
```

---

### 🧪 Example

```python
A = '3'
B = '4'
result = int(A) + int(B)  # 7
```

---

### ✅ Summary Table

|Input|Output|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|`'3' + '4'`|`'34'`|String concatenation|
|`3 + 4`|`7`|Numeric addition|
|`int('3') + int('4')`|`7`|Convert then add|

---

### 💬 Good Practice

If you expect numeric operations, **always store values as numbers**, not strings.
