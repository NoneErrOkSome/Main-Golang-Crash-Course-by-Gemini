## 🔁 Part 10 – Comparing `Eq(q, r)` and Interpreting LaTeX vs Python Code

### 📌 Purpose

This part shows how to compare two expressions — one written using LaTeX-style input (`"x^2"`) and the other using Python-style input (`"x**2"`) — both processed through `sympify()`, and how SymPy handles their **interpretation and comparison**.

---

### 🧾 Setup

```python
q = sym.sympify("x^2")
r = sym.sympify("x**2")
```

- `q` is built from LaTeX-style caret (`^`)
    
- `r` is built from Python-style exponentiation (`**`)
    

Both produce:

$$ x^2 $$

---

### ✅ Step 1: Display the Expressions

```python
display(q)  # → x^2
display(r)  # → x^2
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Test Equality

```python
sym.Eq(q, r)
```

**Output:**

$$ x^2 = x^2 $$

You may also verify with:

```python
q == r  # True
```

✔️ Both expressions are **structurally identical**

---

### 🧠 Why This Works

- `sympify()` interprets `"x^2"` as power because it's a **string**, not raw Python code.
    
- Internally, both expressions become the same symbolic tree:
    
    Pow(x,2)\text{Pow}(x, 2)

---

### 🔍 Bonus: What If They’re Different?

```python
q = sym.sympify("x^2")
r = sym.sympify("x^3")
sym.Eq(q, r)  # → x^2 = x^3
```

Still outputs a symbolic equality object, but now they are **not equal**.

---

### ✅ Summary Table

|Expression|Tool|Result|
|---|---|---|
|`"x^2"` via `sympify`|LaTeX-style string|Interpreted as $x^2$|
|`"x**2"` via `sympify`|Python-style string|Also $x^2$|
|`Eq(q, r)`|Symbolic comparison|Returns True if structurally equal|
