Here is your **full SymPy + LaTeX Jupyter cell**, combining **Part 1 and Part 2** into one clean block. You can paste this into a Jupyter Notebook or VS Code cell as-is:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math
import sympy as sym

# --- Symbols ---
mu, alpha = sym.symbols('mu, alpha')
x, y = sym.symbols('x y')
q, r = sym.symbols('q r')

# --- LaTeX Display 1 ---
expr = 2 * sym.exp(mu**2 / alpha)
display(Math(fr"\large {sym.latex(expr)}"))

# --- LaTeX Display 2 (Custom Expression) ---
display(Math(fr'1234 + \frac{{3x}}{{\sin(2\pi t+\theta)}}'))

# --- Numeric Evaluation ---
a = 3
b = 4
print(sym.sympify(a + b))  # should be 7

# --- Equation Display ---
display(sym.Eq(4*x, 2))

# --- Part 1 of 2: Manual power ---
q = x**2
r = x**2
display(q)
display(r)

# --- Part 2 of 2: Sympify differences ---
q = sym.sympify("x^2")     # interprets ^ as XOR, but sympy fixes this
r = sym.sympify("x**2")
display(q)
display(r)
display(sym.Eq(q, r))      # shows symbolic equality

# --- Square Root Expression ---
equation = (4*x**2 - 5*x + 10)**(1/2)
display(equation)
print(equation.subs(x, 3))  # Evaluate at x=3

# --- Complex polynomial expression ---
equation2 = 1/4 * x * y**2 - x * (5*x + 10*y**2)**3
display(equation2)
```

Let me know if you want an Obsidian LaTeX version of the math parts too!
