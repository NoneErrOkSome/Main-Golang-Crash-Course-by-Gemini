## ⚠️ Part 5 – Demonstrating Non-Simplifiable Expressions (Different Bases)

### 📌 Purpose

This part illustrates how SymPy behaves when you attempt to simplify **invalid expressions** using the law of exponents — particularly when the **bases are different**, so the rule does **not apply**.

---

### 🧾 Step 1: Create a Non-Simplifiable Expression

```python
expr = x**y * y**z
```

This represents:

$$ x^y \cdot y^z $$

---

### 🔁 Step 2: Try to Simplify It

```python
sym.simplify(expr)
```

**Output:**

$$ x^y \cdot y^z $$

- SymPy leaves the expression **unchanged**
    
- Because the **bases `x` and `y` are different**
    
- The law of exponents:
    

$$ a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} $$

**only applies if the bases are the same**

---

### ❌ Common Mistake

Incorrectly applying:

$$ x^y \cdot y^z = (xy)^{y+z} \quad \text{(WRONG)} $$

This is **not valid algebra** unless you're specifically told the exponents are equal and the expression can be factored — which it cannot in this general symbolic form.

---

### ✅ Correct Understanding

|Expression|Is Simplified?|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|$x^y \cdot x^z$|Yes → $x^{y+z}$|Same base|
|$x^y \cdot y^z$|❌ No|Different bases|

---

### 🖨️ Optional Display

```python
display(expr)
display(sym.simplify(expr))
```

Both will render:

$$ x^y \cdot y^z $$

No transformation occurs.

---

### 💡 Teaching Use Case

This is a great example to **test conceptual understanding**:

- A symbolic simplifier will **only simplify expressions** that follow formal math rules.
    
- Any violation (like different bases or wrong operations) results in **no change**.
