## 📚 Part 1 – Understanding the Law of Exponents Conceptually

### 📌 Purpose

This part introduces the **law of exponents** from a conceptual, symbolic perspective. Before jumping into SymPy and code, it explains the math rule that governs how powers behave during multiplication and division.

---

### 🧠 Law of Exponents – Multiplication

When multiplying powers with the **same base**:

$$ \Large x^y \cdot x^z = x^{y + z} $$

#### ✅ Conditions:

- Only valid if the **base is the same** (both terms are powers of xx)
    
- The operation is **multiplication**
    

---

### ➗ Law of Exponents – Division

When dividing powers with the same base:

$$ \Large \frac{x^y}{x^z} = x^{y - z} $$

#### 🔁 Why?

Because:

$$\Large \frac{x^y}{x^z} = x^y \cdot \frac{1}{x^z} = x^y \cdot x^{-z} = x^{y - z} $$

---

### ⚠️ Important Restrictions

This rule **only applies** when:

- The **base** is the same (e.g. $\Large x^y \cdot x^z$, not $\Large x^y \cdot y^z$)
    
- The operation is **multiplication or division**
    

#### ❌ Example of invalid simplification:

$$ \Large x^y \cdot y^z \neq \text{cannot be simplified} $$

- Bases are different → rule does **not** apply
    
- This expression is already as simple as it gets

### 💬 Summary Table

| Expression               | Simplifies to    | Reason                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| $\Large x^y \cdot x^z$   | $\Large x^{y+z}$ | Same base, multiplication           |
| $\Large \frac{x^y}{x^z}$ | $\Large x^{y-z}$ | Division = negative exponent        |
| $\Large x^y \cdot y^z$   | —                | Different bases → no simplification |
|                          |                  |                                     |

This conceptual foundation sets up the purpose of the upcoming SymPy code examples, which are used to **verify and visualize these rules computationally**.
