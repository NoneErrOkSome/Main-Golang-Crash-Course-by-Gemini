To fully cover all the details in this transcript, we need to break it into **12 structured parts**, each corresponding to a distinct concept, tool, or technique presented in the video. The video blends **mathematical theory (law of exponents)** with **SymPy coding** and **LaTeX rendering**, making it both theoretical and practical.

### ðŸ“Œ Each part would include:

- The **mathematical idea** or **coding tool**
    
- How itâ€™s implemented in Python with SymPy
    
- What output it gives
    
- Any exceptions, limitations, or variations
