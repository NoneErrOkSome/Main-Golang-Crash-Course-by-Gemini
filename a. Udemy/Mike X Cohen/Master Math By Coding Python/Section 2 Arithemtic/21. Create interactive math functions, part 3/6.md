### 📘 **Part 6 — Final Reflection on Function Mastery and Learning Progress**

---

After the successful run of the guessing game, the speaker closes the video with a reflective summary of what the viewer has accomplished:

> “In these past several videos, you have learned how to make **interactive math functions** using functions in Python.”

---

### 🧠 **Types of Functions Reviewed**

The speaker highlights the variety of functions covered throughout the project series:

- Functions that **take input**
    
- Functions that **return output**
    
- Functions that **require no input or output**
    
    - e.g., `guess_the_number()` — everything happens internally

### 🛠️ **Emphasizing Practical Coding Skills**

> “Creating your own functions in Python is a really important skill in programming.”

- Function-building is not only about structure, but also about:
    
    - Handling user input
        
    - Designing logical control flow
        
    - Organizing code cleanly with planning and comments

### 🧗 **Encouragement for Continued Progress**

> “I hope you now feel like you have a pretty strong footing to continue improving your coding skills.”

- The speaker affirms that the viewer has developed solid **foundational skills**:
    
    - Writing custom functions
        
    - Managing user interaction
        
    - Using control structures like `while` and `if`

### 🎯 **End of the Project**

With the guessing game completed, the speaker concludes the project series and prepares the viewer for **more complex and creative uses** of functions in Python.

This final message marks a transition from basic interactive programming into more advanced problem solving with confidence.
