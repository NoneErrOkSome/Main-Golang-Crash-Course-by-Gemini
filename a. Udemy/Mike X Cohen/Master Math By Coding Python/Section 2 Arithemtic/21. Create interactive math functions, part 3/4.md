### 📘 **Part 4 — Translating the Plan into Python Code**

---

Now that the structure has been laid out with comments, the speaker begins coding:

> “So now we can get started.”

---

### 🧩 **Step 1: Define the Function**

```python
def guess_the_number():
```

- Function has **no parameters**
    
- All variables and logic are handled **inside** the function
    

---

### 🎲 **Step 2: Generate a Random Integer**

```python
num_to_guess = random.randint(1, 101)
```

- Uses `random.randint(1, 101)` to pick an integer from **1 to 100**
    
- Reminder: the second argument is **exclusive**, so `101` includes `100`
    

> “That seems like a good variable name.”

---

### 🎯 **Step 3: Ask the User for a Guess**

```python
user_guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
```

- Prompts the user to enter their first guess
    
- Uses `int()` to convert input string to an integer
    

---

#### ⚠️ Important Note About Input Safety:

> “This code is going to crash if the user inputs a number that is not an integer...”

- If the user types a decimal (e.g., `42.5`), the function will raise a `ValueError`
    
- However, for this exercise, **input validation is skipped**
    

> “We are going to be assuming that only integer numbers will be entered.”

---

### 🔁 **Step 4: Start the Guessing Loop**

```python
while user_guess != num_to_guess:
```

- This loop continues **until** the user guesses correctly
    

> “The idea of a while loop is that you stay inside this loop... until the condition becomes false.”

---

### 🧠 **Step 5: Conditional Logic Inside the Loop**

```python
if user_guess < num_to_guess:
    print("Guess higher")
elif user_guess > num_to_guess:
    print("Guess lower")
```

- If guess is too low → print **"Guess higher"**
    
- If guess is too high → print **"Guess lower"**
    

> “We want to give a little bit of informative feedback here.”

---

### 🔁 **Step 6: Prompt Again Inside the Loop**

```python
user_guess = int(input("Guess again: "))
```

- After giving feedback, the loop **asks for another guess**
    
- Re-evaluates the loop condition again
    

---

> “We go through this over and over and over again, and eventually the user guess is the same thing as this variable `num_to_guess`.”

---

### 🎉 **Step 7: Final Message After Correct Guess**

```python
print("Yes, you guessed correctly!")
```

- Once the loop exits (i.e., the guess is correct), this message is printed
    

---

### 🧼 **Review of the Logic Flow**

- Initial guess is taken before the loop
    
- The `while` loop handles all incorrect attempts
    
- Inside the loop:
    
    - Feedback is printed
        
    - New guess is requested
        
- When the guess is correct:
    
    - Loop ends
        
    - Success message is shown
        

---

> “You can see this is actually not such a long, difficult, involved function to create.”

> “The key to solving this function correctly and efficiently was starting with comments.”

In **Part 5**, the speaker tests the game interactively and celebrates when they win.
