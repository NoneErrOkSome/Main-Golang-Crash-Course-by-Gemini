### 💡 **Before Coding — Helpful Hints**

The speaker pauses to give the viewer a chance to attempt the project independently:

> “If you don’t want these hints, if you just want to get started right away, now is your opportunity to pause the video and switch to Python.”

---

Then, three key **hints** are introduced:

#### 🔹 Hint 1: Generate a Random Integer

- Use the `random` module from **NumPy**:
    
    ```python
    from numpy import random
    ```
    
- Generate a random integer using:
    
    ```python
    random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)
    ```
    
- Example:
    
    ```python
    random.randint(1, 101)
    ```
    
    - The number will be from **1 to 100** (upper bound is **exclusive** in Python)
        

---

#### 🔹 Hint 2: Use a `while` Loop

> “The way you want to solve this is with a while function. So not a for loop but a while loop.”

- `while` loops are useful when the number of repetitions is **unknown** ahead of time — perfect for guessing games.
    

---

#### 🔹 Hint 3: Use `!=` for "Not Equal"

> “You might want to use this funny-looking construction: exclamation point equals, which actually means not equals.”

- Example:
    
    ```python
    while user_guess != num_to_guess:
    ```
    
    - The loop continues **until** the user gets it right.

### 🔄 **Importing the Random Module**

- Demonstrates importing:
    
    ```python
    from numpy import random
    ```
    
- Explains this import style:
    
    - Makes `random` available **directly**
        
    - Unlike `import numpy as np`, which would require calling `np.random.randint(...)`
        

> “This function `random` is going to go directly into the default Python workspace.”

---

### 🔎 **Testing `random.randint()`**

- Demonstrates with a small range to understand behavior:
    
    ```python
    random.randint(1, 5)
    ```
    
- Runs several times:
    
    - Outputs: `2`, then `4`, then `2`, then `3`
        
- Clarification:
    
    - Output is **between 1 and 4** (not 5), since the upper bound is **exclusive**
        

> “I wrote 5 here but it’s going to be one less than the upper number, because that’s how indexing in Python works.”

### ✅ **Conclusion of Setup**

- With the random integer generator tested and hints explained, the speaker transitions into **planning the function** using comments.
    

> “So this is a big project, or... medium-sized project; we need to figure out how to organize our code writing experience.”

In **Part 3**, the speaker outlines the structure of the function using detailed comments before writing any real code.
