### üìò **Part 7 ‚Äî Wrapping Up the Series and What Comes Next**

---

After completing the interactive guessing game and reflecting on function-building skills, the speaker closes the video series with a message of **transition and encouragement**.

### üîÅ **Review of What Was Accomplished**

Throughout the last several videos, the speaker reminds us that:

> ‚ÄúYou have learned how to make **interactive math functions** using functions in Python.‚Äù

These included:

- Simple greeting and print functions
    
- Functions with mathematical logic (like remainder, division, powers)
    
- Functions with **user input** and **conditional branches**
    
- A complete interactive **guessing game** using:
    
    - `random.randint`
        
    - `while` loops
        
    - `if`/`elif` conditions
        
    - Real-time input processing

### üéØ **Functions Took Many Forms**

> ‚ÄúSome of these functions take input, some functions give outputs, other functions don't require inputs or outputs.‚Äù

- Examples:
    
    - `computeremainder(x, y)` ‚Üí takes input
        
    - `divisionwithinput()` ‚Üí asks for input inside the function
        
    - `guess_the_number()` ‚Üí no external input or output, but manages everything internally

### üß± **Emphasis on Skill Building**

> ‚ÄúCreating your own functions in Python is a really important skill in programming.‚Äù

- These exercises were not just academic ‚Äî they mirror the **real work** of writing reusable, clear, and interactive code
    

---

### üöÄ **Encouragement to Keep Growing**

> ‚ÄúI hope you now feel like you have a pretty strong footing to continue improving your coding skills.‚Äù

- The speaker invites viewers to:
    
    - Keep experimenting
        
    - Build more creative projects
        
    - Try expanding these functions into larger programs

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

This part marks the **end of the functions mini-series** and the successful completion of an entire interactive project that combined:

- Planning
    
- Logic
    
- Randomness
    
- Looping
    
- Input handling
    
- Structured function design
    

The viewer is now ready for more ambitious Python tasks and has a strong foundation for continuing forward.
