### 📘 **Part 1 — Introduction and Game Concept**

---

- The video begins by continuing the exploration of **functions in Python**, focusing now on building **interactive math functions**.
    

> “This video is a continuation of our discovery of functions in Python and how to write interactive math functions in Python.”

### 🎯 **Project Objective: The Guessing Game**

- The main goal of this project is to create a **function** called:
    
    ```python
    guess_the_number()
    ```
    
- This function allows the user to play a game where:
    
    1. Python **randomly selects** an integer between 1 and 100.
        
    2. The user must **guess** the number that Python has chosen.
        
    3. After each guess, Python provides feedback:
        
        - If the guess is **too low** → it tells the user to **guess higher**
            
        - If the guess is **too high** → it tells the user to **guess lower**
            
        - If the guess is **correct** → it congratulates the user

### 🧪 **Example Gameplay Walkthrough (from the transcript)**

- Python internally chooses a number: let’s say **78**
    
- User's guess history:
    
    - Guess: `42` → Python replies: “Guess higher”
        
    - Guess: `60` → Python replies: “Guess higher”
        
    - Guess: `80` → Python replies: “Guess lower”
        
    - Guess: `75` → Python replies: “Guess higher”
        
    - Finally, Guess: `78` → Python replies: “The right number was 78”

> “Eventually I got to the right answer of 78, and then I got this nice friendly message that said the right number was 78.”

### ✅ **Summary of Requirements**

- The goal of this part is to:
    
    - Define a single function: `guess_the_number`
        
    - Inside the function:
        
        - Generate a **random integer from 1 to 100**
            
        - Prompt the user repeatedly for guesses
            
        - Give directional feedback after each guess
            
        - Congratulate the user when the guess is correct
