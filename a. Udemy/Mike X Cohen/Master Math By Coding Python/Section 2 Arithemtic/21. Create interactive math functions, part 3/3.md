### 📘 **Part 3 — Writing a Structured Outline Using Comments**

---

Before writing any code, the speaker emphasizes the importance of **thinking through the logic first**:

> “So what I’m going to do is… I’m actually just gonna write a bunch of comments.”

This step lays out the plan clearly **before implementing anything**.

### 🧱 **Function Outline as Comments**

The speaker begins commenting the steps of the function in order:

```python
# Function definition
# No inputs necessary
# Generate a random integer
# Ask the user for a guess
# Check whether the guess matches
#   - If too low, print a message and ask again
#   - If too high, print a message and ask again
#   - If correct, congratulate the user
```

Each comment corresponds directly to a functional part of the code.

> “Notice I haven’t actually written any code yet. All I’m doing here is thinking about the high-level structure of what the code should look like.”

- ✅ This strategy:
    
    - Prevents confusion
        
    - Makes the purpose of each block of code clear
        
    - Reduces mistakes by visualizing the logic first

### 📌 **Notes About Inputs**

> “We don’t need any inputs — no inputs necessary.”

- Why?
    
    - Because all data (random number + user input) will be handled **inside** the function
        
    - No arguments are passed into the function when it’s called

### 📋 **Main Stages (In Planning)**

1. **Define the function**: `def guess_the_number():`
    
2. **Generate a number**: `random.randint(1, 101)`
    
3. **Get the user’s first guess**: `input(...)`
    
4. **Enter a loop** (`while`) to keep asking until correct
    
5. **Use `if` statements** to compare guesses
    
6. **Provide feedback and repeat if wrong**
    
7. **Print a congratulatory message when correct**

> “When I was sure that the comments all made sense, then I started to write code.”

In **Part 4**, the speaker starts translating this plan into real Python code, beginning with the function definition and input logic.
