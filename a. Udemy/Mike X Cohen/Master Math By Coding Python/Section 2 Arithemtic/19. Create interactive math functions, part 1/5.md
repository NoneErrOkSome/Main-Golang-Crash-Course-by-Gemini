### 📘 **Part 5 — Summary, Insights, and What's Next**

---

- After building and testing the function `divisionwithinput`, the speaker highlights key **lessons learned**:
    
    - **When defining a function**, it's okay to use variables that are not defined **outside** the function.
        
        - These are only needed **when the function is called**.
            
    - **Using `input()`**:
        
        - This lets the user type values while the code is running.
            
        - But it always returns a **string**.
            
    - **Using `int()`**:
        
        - Converts string input to an integer.
            
        - Needed before doing any math with the input values.
            

---

- The speaker shows that:
    
    - You can **nest functions**, such as putting `input()` inside `int()`:
        
        ```python
        x = int(input("Input the numerator: "))
        ```
        
        - This takes the result from `input()` and immediately converts it to an integer.
            

---

- A key **problem** discovered:
    
    - Trying to enter a **decimal number** like `10.4` still causes an error:
        
        - `int("10.4")` is not valid.
            
        - This is because the string contains a **decimal point**, and `int()` cannot handle that.
            

---

- The speaker explains:
    
    - This shows the **importance of testing** code with different types of inputs.
        
    - **Not all user input** will work as expected unless your code prepares for it.

- ❌ The decimal input problem is **not fixed in this video**.
    
    - The speaker states that handling this kind of issue will be covered **later in the course**.

- 📌 **Main takeaway**:
    
    - You now know how to:
        
        - Create a function using `def`
            
        - Accept inputs via function parameters or user input
            
        - Use `print()` to show output
            
        - Convert string inputs to numbers with `int()`

- ✅ **Closing note**:
    
    - The speaker says:
        
        - “I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.”
            
        - “You learned the basics of creating functions in Python…”
            
        - “I'm going to continue teaching you about working with functions over the next several videos…”
            
        - **Encouragement to keep watching** the course.
