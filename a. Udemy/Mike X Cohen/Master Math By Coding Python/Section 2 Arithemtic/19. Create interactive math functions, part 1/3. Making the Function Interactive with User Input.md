Certainly! Here's an improved version of **Part 3**, rewritten in clearer and more structured language, staying true to the transcript's scope, and styled as if it were being explained in a Jupyter Notebook environment:

---

### 📘 **Part 3 — Making the Function Interactive with User Input**

---

### 🧭 **Goal**

The speaker now wants to make the `computeremainder` function **more interactive** by allowing the user to **enter the numbers manually** rather than hardcoding them.

---

### ✍️ Step 1: Copying the Function — With a New Name

- The original `computeremainder(x, y)` function required two arguments.
    
- To make it interactive, the speaker creates a **new function** that uses `input()` to **prompt the user**.
    

> 💡 Reusing the same function name would overwrite the old one in Jupyter.  
> To avoid confusion, a new function is named:

```python
def divisionwithinput():
```

---

### 💻 Code Cell — Early Version (Strings Only)

```python
def divisionwithinput():
    x = input("Input the numerator: ")
    y = input("Input the denominator: ")
```

- The `input()` function always returns a **string** — even if you type a number.
    
- To demonstrate this, the speaker runs:
    

```python
a = input("Input a number: ")
print(a)         # e.g., '55'
type(a)          # <class 'str'>
```

---

### 🧠 To Fix: Convert String to Integer

> “We want to do math with these values, so they need to be integers.”

You can **nest** `input()` inside `int()` to convert the result immediately:

```python
a = int(input("Input a number: "))
```

- Now, if you input `65`, it becomes a proper integer:
    
    ```python
    type(a)  # <class 'int'>
    ```
    

---

### 💻 Code Cell — Final Version of the Function

```python
def divisionwithinput():
    x = int(input("Input the numerator: "))
    y = int(input("Input the denominator: "))
    divis = x // y
    remainder = x % y
    print("%g goes into %g %g times with a remainder of %g" % (y, x, divis, remainder))
```

---

### ▶️ Running the Function

```python
divisionwithinput()
```

#### Example Input:

```
Input the numerator: 10  
Input the denominator: 3
```

#### Output:

```
3 goes into 10 3 times with a remainder of 1
```

✅ Works correctly — performs division using user-provided numbers.

---

### ❌ Error Case: Inputting a Decimal

```plaintext
Input the numerator: 10.4
```

- 💥 Output:
    

```
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10.4'
```

- Explanation:
    
    - `'10.4'` is a **string that represents a decimal**
        
    - `int()` cannot convert it, because it expects a whole number like `'10'`
        

---

### 🧪 Important Takeaway

- The speaker emphasizes:
    
    > “It’s important to test your code with different types of input.”
    
- ⚠️ Decimal handling is **not addressed yet** in this version.
    
- The lesson focuses on:
    
    - Accepting input
        
    - Converting to integer
        
    - Running mathematical operations inside a function
