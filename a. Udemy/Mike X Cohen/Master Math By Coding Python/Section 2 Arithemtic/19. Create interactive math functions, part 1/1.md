You're absolutely right — since the instructor was using **Jupyter Notebook**, the examples should be clearer by separating **code cells** from **outputs** just like in an actual notebook. Let me rewrite **Part 1** with more precise formatting to match how things look and behave in Jupyter Notebook:

---

### 📘 **Part 1 — Function Basics and First Example (Improved for Jupyter)**

---

### ✳️ Introduction

- The speaker begins:
    
    > “This is going to be a really exciting video.”
    
- While they say that often, this time it's special because you're going to learn how to create your **own functions in Python**.
    
- They emphasize:
    
    > “Creating functions is a really important skill for Python and programming in general.”
    

---

### 💻 First Code Cell — Function Definition

```python
def myfunction():
    print("hello world")
```

- 💡 This **defines** a function called `myfunction`:
    
    - `def` means “define a function”
        
    - `myfunction` is the name
        
    - `()` means it **takes no input**
        
    - `:` starts the function body
        
    - `print("hello world")` is what it does
        

---

### ▶️ Running the Cell Above

- **What happens?**
    
    - ✅ No error
        
    - ❌ No output
        

> That’s expected. You **defined** the function — Python knows what it is now, but it hasn’t run it yet.

---

### 💻 Second Code Cell — Calling the Function

```python
myfunction()
```

- ✅ Output:
    

```
hello world
```

> This actually **runs** the function and prints out the message.

- 🧠 Note: In Jupyter, the speaker also uses **Tab autocomplete** — type `myfun` and press `Tab`, and it fills in `myfunction`.
    

---

### ✳️ Moving On: Functions That Take Input

---

### 💻 Example — A Built-in Function with Input

```python
int(3.2)
```

- ✅ Output:
    

```
3
```

> The function `int()` **takes an input** and returns a result — that’s how many functions work.

---

### 💻 Define a Function with One Input

```python
def myfunction(name):
    print("hello %s" % name)
```

- This version of `myfunction`:
    
    - Takes one input: `name`
        
    - Prints: `hello Mike` if you give `"Mike"` as input
        

---

### ▶️ Running Just the Function Definition Cell

- Again, **no output**, and no error — you're only defining the function.
    

---

### 💻 Call the Function with an Input

```python
myfunction("Mike")
```

- ✅ Output:
    

```
hello Mike
```

- Explanation:
    
    - `"Mike"` is passed into `name`
        
    - The `%s` in the string is replaced by the value of `name`
        
    - Python prints the formatted message
        

---

### ⚠️ Important Observation

- If you try this in a cell:
    

```python
name
```

- ❌ Output:
    

```
NameError: name 'name' is not defined
```

> Because `name` only exists **inside** the function — not in the global workspace.

---

### 🔄 Transition

The speaker ends this part by saying:

> “Since this is a course about using Python as a tool to learn mathematics, not just saying hello to yourself…”

They decide to **redefine the function for a math-related task** in the next part.

Let me know if you'd like me to go back and reformat **Parts 2–7** the same way for clarity in Jupyter-style.
