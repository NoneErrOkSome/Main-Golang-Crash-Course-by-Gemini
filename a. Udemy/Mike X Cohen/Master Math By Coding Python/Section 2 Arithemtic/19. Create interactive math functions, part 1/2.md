Absolutely! Here's an improved version of **Part 2**, rewritten in clearer language while staying strictly within the original scope of the transcript, and formatted to feel like it's in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment:

---

### 📘 **Part 2 — Defining a Function to Compute Integer Division and Remainder**

---

### ✳️ Purpose

After showing how to write simple greeting functions, the speaker shifts to something **more mathematical**: writing a function that calculates how many times one number fits into another — and what the remainder is.

---

### 💻 Code Cell — Define the Function

```python
def computeremainder(x, y):
    divis = x // y
    remainder = x % y
    print("%g goes into %g %g times with a remainder of %g" % (y, x, divis, remainder))
```

---

### 🧠 Explanation

- The function is named `computeremainder`.
    
- It takes **two arguments**: `x` and `y`
    
    - `x` is the number you're dividing (the **numerator**)
        
    - `y` is the number you're dividing by (the **denominator**)
        

---

### 🔍 What Happens Inside

1. `x // y`  
    → Performs **integer division**: how many full times `y` fits into `x`  
    → Result is stored in the variable `divis`
    
2. `x % y`  
    → Calculates the **remainder** left after dividing `x` by `y`  
    → Result is stored in `remainder`
    
3. The `print()` statement shows a full sentence with the values:
    
    - It uses `%g` for formatting numbers in a clean, compact way.
        

> Note: `%` is being used in **two different ways** here:
> 
> - As the **modulus operator** (in `x % y`)
>     
> - As a **placeholder for formatting** strings (in `"%g ..." % (values)`)
>     

This is a concept in programming called **operator overloading** — where the same symbol does different things depending on context.

---

### ▶️ Running the Definition Cell

- Nothing prints — that's normal.
    
- The function is now available for use.
    

---

### 💻 Code Cell — Call Without Arguments

```python
computeremainder()
```

- ❌ Output:
    

```
TypeError: computeremainder() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'x' and 'y'
```

- This happens because the function **expects two inputs**.
    

---

### ✅ Call the Function with Arguments

```python
computeremainder(10, 3)
```

- ✔️ Output:
    

```
3 goes into 10 3 times with a remainder of 1
```

---

```python
computeremainder(100, 6)
```

- ✔️ Output:
    

```
6 goes into 100 16 times with a remainder of 4
```

---

The speaker confirms the outputs are correct and says:

> “That’s really great… I know that that answer is correct.”

---

### 🔄 What’s Next

So far, the function works well for fixed, hardcoded numbers. But in the next step, the speaker wants to let the **user type in the numbers** interactively using `input()` — making the function more dynamic and reusable.
