### ðŸ“˜ **Part 4 â€” Debugging Input Errors and Wrapping Up Function Behavior**

---

- Continuing from the last part, the speaker highlights a **problem**:
    
    - The error when using `10.4` as input is because:
        
        - `input()` returns a **string**
            
        - `int()` **cannot convert** a decimal string like `'10.4'` into an integer
            

---

- The speaker refers back to the earlier explanation:
    
    - Even though the user **thinks** they are entering a number, Python **interprets** the input as a string.
        
    - So trying to compute `x // y` or `x % y` where `x` and `y` are strings causes an error.
        
    - Example analogy:
        
        - Dividing `"w"` by `"h"` makes no sense â€” same goes for dividing two strings.
            

---

- **Fix for the error:**
    
    - The speaker updates the code by wrapping both input values in `int()`:
        
    
    ```python
    def divisionwithinput():
        x = int(input("Input the numerator: "))
        y = int(input("Input the denominator: "))
        divis = x // y
        remainder = x % y
        print("%g goes into %g %g times with a remainder of %g" % (y, x, divis, remainder))
    ```
    

---

- **Run the function again:**
    
    - Input:
        
        ```
        numerator: 10  
        denominator: 3
        ```
        
    - Output:
        
        ```
        3 goes into 10 3 times with a remainder of 1
        ```
        

---

- The speaker now **demonstrates what still goes wrong**:
    
    - Inputting a **decimal** (e.g., `10.4`) causes an **error again**:
        
        - `int("10.4")` is invalid
            
        - The function crashes and does not handle this case

- Final message:
    
    - This error will **not be fixed in this video**
        
    - The speaker wants to stay focused on:
        
        - The **basics of defining functions**
            
        - How to **work with functions**
            
        - How to **use user input**
