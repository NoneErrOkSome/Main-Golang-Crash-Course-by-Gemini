Here’s a structured summary of the video transcript on **Python comments**:

### 🧠 **Topic: Comments in Python**

#### 📌 **What Are Comments?**

- Comments are lines in code that **Python ignores**.
    
- They’re meant for **humans** to read — to explain, organize, and document code.

### ✍️ **How to Write a Comment**

#### ✅ **Single-Line Comment**

Starts with a hash (`#`):

```python
# This is a comment
x = 5  # This is also a comment after a line of code
```

- Everything **after the `#`** is ignored by Python.
    
- Commonly used to explain **what the code is doing** or to **temporarily disable code**.
    

#### 🔁 **Toggling Comments (Windows Shortcut)**

- **Toggle comment/uncomment**: `Ctrl + /`
    
- Works for **single or multiple lines**

### 💻 **Code Behavior Explained**

```python
x = 5
display(x)  # This prints 5

# y = 3  → this line is ignored because it's a comment
print(y)    # ❌ Error: y is not defined

# Remove `#` to define y:
y = 3
print(y)    # ✅ Outputs: 3
```

### 🧩 **Why Use Comments?**

- Help others (and your future self) **understand** your code
    
- Clarify the purpose of variables, functions, or blocks
    
- Essential for **clean and maintainable code**
    
- Especially helpful when returning to code after days, weeks, or months

### 💬 **Tips**

- Use comments to label sections:
    
    ```python
    # --- Variable Declarations ---
    x = 5
    y = 3
    
    # --- Function Definitions ---
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    ```
    
- Avoid over-commenting obvious code. Be clear and purposeful.
