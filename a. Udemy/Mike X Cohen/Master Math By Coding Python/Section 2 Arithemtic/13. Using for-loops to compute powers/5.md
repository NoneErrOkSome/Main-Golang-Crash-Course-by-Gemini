## ðŸ“’ Part 5: Flexible Power Table with Base Variable

### ðŸ§¾ Goal

Use a for loop to print powers from $\text{base}^0$ through $\text{base}^9$.

Format:

$$ \text{base}^i = \text{value} $$

---

### ðŸ§® Initial Hardcoded Version

```python
for i in range(0, 10):
    print("2 to the power of %g is %g" % (i, 2 ** i))
```

Output:

$$ 2^0 = 1,\quad 2^1 = 2,\quad 2^2 = 4,\quad \ldots,\quad 2^9 = 512 $$

---

### ðŸ§¾ Making It Flexible with a `base` Variable

```python
base = 2

for i in range(0, 10):
    print("%g to the power of %g is %g" % (base, i, base ** i))
```

Changing `base` dynamically:

```python
base = 3    # or any other value
```

Example:

$$ 3^8 = 6561 $$

$$ 32^9 = 3.52 \times 10^{13} $$ (Scientific Notation)

---

### ðŸ§¾ Scientific Notation

Python automatically uses scientific notation for large results:

$$ 32^9 = 3.52 \times 10^{13} $$

This format means:

$$ 3.52 \cdot 10^{13} $$

---

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

- Use `base ** i` inside loop to compute powers.
    
- Format with `%g` for clean output.
    
- Scientific notation appears when numbers are large.
    
- Making `base` a variable allows reuse for any power table.
