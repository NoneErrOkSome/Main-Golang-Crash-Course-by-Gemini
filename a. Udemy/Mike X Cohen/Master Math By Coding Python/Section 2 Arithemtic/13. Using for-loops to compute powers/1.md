## ðŸ“˜ Part 1: Introduction to For Loops in Python

### ðŸ§¾ Concept

A **for loop** repeats code a specific number of times.

Each time through the loop is called an **iteration**.

The format in Python:

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # indented block of code
```

---

### ðŸ§¾ Reserved Keywords

The following are **reserved keywords** and cannot be used as variable names:

- `for`
    
- `in`
    
- `print`
    
- `range`
    
- `list`
    

These are highlighted in green in Jupyter Notebook.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Indentation

Code **inside** the loop must be indented with exactly **4 spaces**.

```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
    print(x)        # this is inside the loop
```

If the `:` is missing or indentation is incorrect, Python will raise a syntax error.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Variable Behavior

In each iteration, the loop variable takes on the next value in the sequence.

Example:

```python
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    print(i)
```

Output:

$$ 0,\quad 1,\quad 2,\quad 3 $$
