Based strictly on the **Jupyter Notebook structure** and your preferred **LaTeX + Python math-only format**, here’s the breakdown of how many parts are required to fully cover all math-related and loop-related calculations — based on the transcript provided:

---

## ✅ Total: **5 Parts** Recommended

---

### 📘 **Part 1: Introduction to For Loops in Python**

- Core logic of a `for` loop
    
- Reserved keywords: `for`, `in`, `range`, `list`, `print`
    
- Basic formatting:
    
    - Colon `:` requirement
        
    - 4-space indentation (structure)
        
- How iteration works step by step
    

---

### 📗 **Part 2: Simple Loop over Range**

- Manual loop over list: `for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]`
    
- Example: printing `i` directly
    
- Modifying loop output: print `i * 2`
    

```python
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    print(i * 2)
```

---

### 📙 **Part 3: Using `range()` and Formatting Output**

- `range(0, 3)` → produces 0, 1, 2
    
- Use of `list(range(...))` to preview values
    
- Print example with `%g` string formatting
    
- Using custom variable names (e.g., `qwerty`)
    
- Output like: “This is the 0th iteration”
    

```python
for qwerty in range(0, 3):
    print("This is the %gth iteration" % qwerty)
```

---

### 📕 **Part 4: Loop with Powers (e.g. Squaring)**

- Loop with range and exponent:
    
    - $t^2$ where $t = 0$ to $4$
        
- Example:
    

```python
for t in range(0, 5):
    num = t ** 2
    print(num)
```

- Prints: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16
    

---

### 📒 **Part 5: Flexible Power Table with Base Variable**

- Print power table from $0$ to $9$:
    
    - $\text{base}^i$ where base is variable
        
- Format: “base to the power of i is result”
    

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

base = 2
for i in range(0, 10):
    print("%g to the power of %g is %g" % (base, i, base ** i))
```

- Base can be changed to 3, 32, etc.
    
- Python handles large outputs using **scientific notation** (e.g., `3.5e+13`)

This covers all **loop logic**, **power calculation**, and **output formatting** as shown in the video using **Jupyter Notebook**. Let me know when to begin with **Part 1**.
