## ðŸ“• Part 4: Loop with Powers (e.g., Squaring)

### ðŸ§® Loop to Compute Squares

Using a for loop with `range(0, 5)` to calculate squares:

```python
for t in range(0, 5):
    num = t ** 2
    print(num)
```

This computes:

$$ 0^2 = 0,\quad 1^2 = 1,\quad 2^2 = 4,\quad 3^2 = 9,\quad 4^2 = 16 $$

---

### ðŸ§¾ Important Behavior

- The loop runs 5 times: $t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$
    
- The result is stored in the variable `num`
    
- `print(num)` outputs each square value
    

---

### ðŸ§¾ Common Mistake

If you forget `print(num)`, nothing appears in the output, even though the math is still computed silently.

Corrected version:

```python
for t in range(0, 5):
    num = t ** 2
    print(num)
```

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

- Use `**` to compute powers inside the loop
    
- Loop variable is used as exponent or base
    
- Python requires `print()` to display results in output
