## ðŸ“™ Part 3: Using `range()` and Formatting Output

### ðŸ§¾ Custom Loop Variable Names

The loop variable doesnâ€™t need to be a single letter. Any valid variable name works.

```python
for qwerty in range(0, 3):
    print(qwerty)
```

Output:

$$ 0,\ 1,\ 2 $$

### ðŸ§® String Formatting with `%g`

To insert values into strings dynamically, use:

```python
print("This is the %gth iteration" % qwerty)
```

Example:

```python
for qwerty in range(0, 3):
    print("This is the %gth iteration" % qwerty)
```

Output:

```
This is the 0th iteration  
This is the 1th iteration  
This is the 2th iteration
```

Note: "1th" and "2th" are grammatically incorrect, but acceptable at this stage since it focuses on logic, not grammar. Later lessons (e.g., if-else) will improve this.

### ðŸ§¾ Cursor Behavior in Jupyter

- If the colon is missing:
    
    - The cursor does **not** indent the next line automatically.
        
- If the colon is present:
    
    - Jupyter automatically indents the next line (4 spaces).

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

- `range(start, stop)` gives numbers from `start` to `stop - 1`.
    
- `%g` is used to inject numbers into strings dynamically.
    
- Loop variable names can be anything valid in Python.
    
- Python uses indentation and colon `:` to define code blocks inside loops.
