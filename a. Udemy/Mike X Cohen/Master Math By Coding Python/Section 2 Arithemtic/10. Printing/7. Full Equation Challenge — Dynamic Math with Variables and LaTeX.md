**Part 7: Full Equation Challenge — Dynamic Math with Variables and LaTeX**

In this final part of the lesson, you'll take everything you've learned — variables, LaTeX, string formatting, `display()`, and `Math()` — and combine them to solve two **full expression challenges**.

You’ll first display equations **with variable names**, and then again **with their values**, just like you’d see in a textbook or slide.

---

### 🎯 The Goal

You're given two expressions:

1. $3x(4 + y) = 42$
    
2. $-y - \frac{x + 3}{z} = 0$
    

You’ll implement each equation in Python in **two ways**:

- First, as a **symbolic expression** (using variable names)
    
- Then, as a **numerical expression** (substitute values)

### 🧾 Step 1: Define the Variables

Let’s start by assigning values:

```python
x = 7
y = -2
z = 5
```

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Compute the First Expression

The equation is:

$$ 3x(4 + y) = \text{?} $$

Let’s calculate the result:

```python
ans = 3 * x * (4 + y)
```

This gives:

```python
ans = 3 * 7 * (4 + (-2)) = 3 * 7 * 2 = 42
```

✅ Confirmed.

### 🖨️ Step 3: Display the Symbolic Form

Let’s show the **structure of the equation** using letters:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

display(Math("3x(4 + y) = %g" % ans))
```

You get:

$$ 3x(4 + y) = 42 $$

---

### 🧠 Step 4: Display the Numerical Form

Now let’s substitute the actual values:

```python
display(Math("3 \\times %g (4 + %g) = %g" % (x, y, ans)))
```

This shows:

$$ 3 \times 7 (4 + (-2)) = 42 $$

If you prefer subtraction instead of `+ (-2)`, just remove the `+`:

```python
display(Math("3 \\times %g (4 %g) = %g" % (x, y, ans)))
```

Output:

$$ 3 \times 7 (4 - 2) = 42 $$

---

### 📘 Step 5: Second Equation – With a Fraction

The equation is:

$$ -y - \frac{x + 3}{z} = \text{?} $$

Compute it:

```python
ans = -y - (x + 3) / z
```

This gives:

```python
ans = -(-2) - (7 + 3) / 5 = 2 - 10 / 5 = 2 - 2 = 0
```

---

### 🧾 Step 6: Display Symbolic Form

```python
display(Math("-y - \\frac{x + 3}{z} = %g" % ans))
```

Output:

$$ -y - \frac{x + 3}{z} = 0 $$

---

### 🔢 Step 7: Display Numerical Form

Now replace the variables with values:

```python
display(Math("-%g - \\frac{%g + 3}{%g} = %g" % (y, x, z, ans)))
```

Output:

$$ -(-2) - \frac{7 + 3}{5} = 0 $$

You can simplify this display if you prefer:

$$ 2 - \frac{10}{5} = 0 $$

### 🎉 Final Thoughts

You’ve now successfully:

- Created expressions using variables
    
- Calculated answers dynamically
    
- Formatted output using LaTeX and `Math()`
    
- Cleaned up multiplication, fractions, and parentheses
    
- Replaced variables with real values in printed math
    

This wraps up the full LaTeX + Python formatting tutorial! With these skills, you can make your math code outputs look sharp, professional, and ready for teaching, sharing, or documentation.
