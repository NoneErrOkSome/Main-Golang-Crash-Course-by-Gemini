**Part 5: Using LaTeX to Format Real Fractions in Python**

So far, you've learned how to print math expressions like `4 + 5 = 9` cleanly using `display()` and `Math()`. But what if you want to print **fractions** the way you'd write them on paper ‚Äî with one number stacked above another?

That‚Äôs where **LaTeX** comes in.

### ‚úçÔ∏è What Is LaTeX?

**LaTeX** is a typesetting language used for formatting beautiful mathematical equations. It‚Äôs widely used in academic writing, textbooks, and now ‚Äî in Python notebooks through `Math()`.

It lets you create expressions like:

$$ \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$

Instead of just:

```
4 / 5 = 0.8
```

Which doesn‚Äôt look as clean or as mathematical.

---

### üì¶ Step 1: Regular Text-Based Division

You can write:

```python
display(Math("4 / 5 = 0.8"))
```

It works, but it looks more like **computer output** than a math equation.

---

### üìê Step 2: Proper Fraction with LaTeX

To make it look like a real fraction, use LaTeX syntax:

```python
display(Math("\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8"))
```

This gives you:

$$ \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$

Let‚Äôs break this down:

- `\\frac` is the LaTeX command for ‚Äúfraction‚Äù
    
- `{4}` is the **numerator**
    
- `{5}` is the **denominator**
    
- The double backslashes (`\\`) are needed in Python to escape the LaTeX command
    

---

### üî§ Why Use Double Backslashes?

In Python strings:

- A single `\` is used for escape characters like `\n` (newline)
    
- So to write `\frac` properly, you need to **escape the backslash** like this: `\\frac`
    

If you don‚Äôt do this, Python will misinterpret your string and give you errors or incorrect output.

---

### üß™ Full Example

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

display(Math("\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8"))
```

This gives a beautiful, properly formatted math output.

---

### üß† Summary

- `\\frac{a}{b}` in LaTeX creates a stacked fraction
    
- Use `Math()` to render it in Python
    
- Always escape the backslash with another backslash (`\\`) when typing LaTeX in Python strings
    

This is just the start of what LaTeX can do! In **Part 6**, you'll learn how to add multiplication signs like `√ó` (not just `x`) using LaTeX, and how to combine it with variables to display dynamic calculations.
