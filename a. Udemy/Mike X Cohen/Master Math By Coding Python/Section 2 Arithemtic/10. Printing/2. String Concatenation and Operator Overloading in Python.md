**Part 2: String Concatenation and Operator Overloading in Python**

Now that you’ve learned how to use `display()` and `Math()` to make output look more mathematical, let’s explore how to **build expressions dynamically** — especially when you want to insert numbers or variables into your math strings.

This part of the lesson focuses on two important concepts:

- **String concatenation**
    
- **Operator overloading**

### 🔤 The Problem: Mixing Strings and Numbers

Let’s say you try something like this:

```python
display("4 + 3 = " + 4 + 3)
```

You might expect Python to evaluate `4 + 3` and display:

```
4 + 3 = 7
```

But instead, you’ll get a **syntax error**.

That’s because `"4 + 3 = "` is a **string**, and `4 + 3` is an **integer expression**. Python can’t add a string and a number directly.

---

### 🛠️ The Fix: Convert Numbers to Strings First

To fix this, you need to **convert the numbers into strings** using the `str()` function:

```python
display("4 + 3 = " + str(4 + 3))
```

This works, and now Python knows how to combine these values:

- `"4 + 3 = "` is a string
    
- `str(7)` is a string
    
- `+` joins (concatenates) the two strings
    

---

### ➕ What Is String Concatenation?

**Concatenation** means joining strings together using the `+` symbol.

Example:

```python
"Hello, " + "world!"
```

Outputs:

```
Hello, world!
```

In our case:

```python
"4 + 3 = " + str(7)
```

Outputs:

```
4 + 3 = 7
```

### 🔄 Operator Overloading: Same Symbol, Different Jobs

Here’s something important: the `+` operator is being used in **two different ways** here.

1. **Math addition**:
    
    ```python
    4 + 3 = 7
    ```
    
2. **String concatenation**:
    
    ```python
    "4 + 3 = " + "7" = "4 + 3 = 7"
    ```
    

This is called **operator overloading** — when a single symbol (like `+`) does **different things depending on context**.

It’s confusing at first, but Python figures it out based on whether it’s working with **numbers** or **strings**.

---

### 🧠 Takeaway

When building strings that include numbers:

- Always convert numbers to strings using `str()`
    
- Use `+` to join text together
    
- Remember that `+` means different things depending on the data type

In **Part 3**, we’ll combine everything you’ve learned so far — `display()`, `Math()`, variables, and formatting — to start building real math expressions programmatically. Ready to keep going?
