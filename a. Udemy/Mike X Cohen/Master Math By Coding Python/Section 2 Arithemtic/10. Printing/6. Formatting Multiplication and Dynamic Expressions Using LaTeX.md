**Part 6: Formatting Multiplication and Dynamic Expressions Using LaTeX**

Now that you've used LaTeX to make real fractions in Python, let's take the next step and display **multiplication** in a more mathematical and visually clean way — using the **multiplication sign (×)** instead of just writing `"x"`.

We'll also combine this with variables and calculations using `%g` formatting, so that your output continues to look like real math, even when the numbers change.

---

### ✖️ The Problem with Using `"x"` for Multiplication

If you write something like:

```python
display(Math("3.4 x 17 = 57.8"))
```

The `"x"` here is just a **letter**. It looks italicized, and it doesn’t feel like a proper multiplication sign.

In math, we usually write multiplication like this:

$$ 3.4 \times 17 = 57.8 $$

This is cleaner, easier to read, and more mathematically correct.

---

### 🧪 Solution: Use `\\times` in LaTeX

To get that proper multiplication symbol, use LaTeX’s `\\times`:

```python
display(Math("3.4 \\times 17 = 57.8"))
```

Output:

$$ 3.4 \times 17 = 57.8 $$

---

### 🔁 Make It Dynamic with Variables

Let’s say:

```python
x = 3.4
y = 17
```

Now we want to print:

$$ 3.4 \times 17 = 57.8 $$

But using variables, so it always works no matter what values `x` and `y` have.

---

### ✅ Final Code (Clean and Flexible)

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

x = 3.4
y = 17

display(Math("%g \\times %g = %g" % (x, y, x * y)))
```

This prints a properly formatted multiplication equation using the actual values of `x` and `y`, and computes the result dynamically.

---

### 🔢 Explanation

- `%g` is used three times for:
    
    1. First number (`x`)
        
    2. Second number (`y`)
        
    3. The result (`x * y`)
        
- `\\times` is used instead of `"x"` to get the proper math symbol
    

---

### 📌 Recap

- Avoid using `"x"` for multiplication — it’s misleading in math
    
- Use `\\times` in LaTeX to display the correct symbol
    
- Use `%g` with variables to plug in values dynamically
    
- Combine this with `Math()` and `display()` for beautiful results
    

In **Part 7**, you'll take everything you've learned so far and apply it to a challenge: displaying full expressions — first with variables, and then replacing them with numbers — using clean LaTeX formatting. Ready for the final part?
