**Part 3: Using `display()` and `Math()` to Print Real Math Expressions**

Now that you understand string concatenation and how to convert numbers to strings, letâ€™s take things further by using `display()` and `Math()` together with **variables** to print equations that **look like real math**.

---

### ðŸ§ª The Goal

We donâ€™t just want Python to say:

```
4 + 3 = 7
```

We want it to **look like a math equation**, rendered properly, like this:

$$ 4 + 3 = 7 $$

To do that, weâ€™ll use:

```python
display(Math("4 + 3 = 7"))
```

This gives us a **clean and mathematical-looking output**, without quotes, using LaTeX formatting behind the scenes.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Step 1: Combine `Math()` with `display()`

You already learned that this works:

```python
display(Math("4 + 3 = 7"))
```

But now letâ€™s make it **dynamic** by using variables.

Letâ€™s define:

```python
x = 4
y = 5
```

We want Python to automatically compute `x + y`, and then **insert those values** into the displayed equation, so we see:

$$ 4 + 5 = 9 $$

---

### ðŸ”¤ Step 2: Start with Basic Substitution

Try converting everything to strings:

```python
display(Math(str(x) + "+" + str(y)))
```

But this gives:

```
45
```

Thatâ€™s because `"4" + "5"` becomes `"45"`, which is string concatenation, **not math**.

So now we add a `" + "` string in the middle:

```python
display(Math(str(x) + " + " + str(y)))
```

Now we get:

```
4 + 5
```

We're getting closer.

---

### âž• Step 3: Add the `=` and the Result

Letâ€™s finish the equation:

```python
display(Math(str(x) + " + " + str(y) + " = " + str(x + y)))
```

Now Python will:

- Convert `x` and `y` to strings
    
- Add them with `" + "` and `" = "`
    
- Calculate `x + y` and add that too
    

Output:

$$ 4 + 5 = 9 $$

Success!

### âœ… Summary

Youâ€™ve just learned how to:

- Use `display()` and `Math()` to format equations
    
- Combine variables into math strings
    
- Convert numbers to strings with `str()`
    
- Use `+` to join everything together
    

This works, but the string gets long and messy. In **Part 4**, weâ€™ll learn a **cleaner formatting method** using `%g` that shortens the code and makes it easier to read. Ready to continue?
