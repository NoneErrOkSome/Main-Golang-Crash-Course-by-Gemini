**Part 4: Cleaner Equation Formatting with `%g` Placeholders**

In the last part, you built a nicely formatted math expression like:

$$ 4 + 5 = 9 $$

But you may have noticed something: that string was **really long** and filled with a bunch of `str(...) + "..." + str(...)` over and over again.

Now you're going to learn a much **cleaner and more professional way** to write the same thing using Python’s **string formatting syntax** with **`%g` placeholders**.

---

### 🧪 What Is `%g`?

`%g` is a **format specifier** in Python that tells Python:

> “Put a number here. It can be a float or an integer — whichever looks cleaner.”

It’s a shortcut for handling most numbers you want to display.

---

### 🧩 The Old Way (Verbose)

You’ve already done something like this:

```python
display(Math(str(x) + " + " + str(y) + " = " + str(x + y)))
```

It works, but it’s hard to read and hard to scale.

---

### ✅ The New Way (Cleaner)

You can do the same thing more simply like this:

```python
display(Math("%g + %g = %g" % (x, y, x + y)))
```

How does this work?

- `%g + %g = %g` is your template string
    
- The `%` operator after the string matches up the **3 placeholders** with the **3 values**
    
- Python inserts:
    
    - `x` into the first `%g`
        
    - `y` into the second `%g`
        
    - `x + y` into the third `%g`
        

The result is:

$$ 4 + 5 = 9 $$

Clean. Accurate. Easy to update.

### 🧠 How Substitution Works

If you’ve never seen this syntax before, here’s what’s happening:

```python
"%g + %g = %g" % (x, y, x + y)
```

- The **string** has three `%g` spots
    
- After the string, you write `% (x, y, x + y)` to **fill them in**
    
- The first `%g` uses `x`, the second uses `y`, the third uses `x + y`
    

This method:

- **Automatically converts** numbers to strings
    
- Keeps your code **short and readable**
    
- Makes updates super easy
    

---

### 📌 Bonus: Use with `Math()` and `display()`

Here’s the full version that looks clean and math-like:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

x = 4
y = 5

display(Math("%g + %g = %g" % (x, y, x + y)))
```

---

### 🧠 Takeaway

Using `%g` formatting:

- Makes math expressions **much cleaner**
    
- Avoids all the messy string + str(...) stuff
    
- Works beautifully with `display(Math(...))`
    

In **Part 5**, you’ll learn how to make your math output look even more realistic — using **LaTeX formatting for fractions** like real handwritten math. Ready to move on?
