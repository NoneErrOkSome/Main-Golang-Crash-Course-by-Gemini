Here is **Part 2: Logical Operators (AND / OR)**, containing **only** the details from the transcript and using **Python with `IPython.display` and `Math`**:

### ðŸ”— **Part 2: Logical Operators (AND / OR)**

---

#### ðŸ§  Concept (from transcript):

- **Multiple conditionals** can be included in an `if` statement using logical operators:
    
    - `or`: Only one condition needs to be true.
        
    - `and`: Both conditions must be true.
        
- **Example from transcript:**
    
    - If raining **or** snowing â†’ learn Python at home.
        
    - If sunny **and** warm â†’ learn Python at the beach.
        
- The code after the colon runs if the full condition is satisfied.
    
- `or` means **at least one** condition must be true.
    
- `and` means **all** conditions must be true.

#### ðŸ§ª Python Code using `display` and `Math`:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

raining = False
snowing = True

if raining or snowing:
    display(Math(r"\text{Learn Python at home.}"))

sunny = True
warm = True

if sunny and warm:
    display(Math(r"\text{Learn Python at the beach.}"))
```

This example shows both logical operators:

- `or`: triggers if **either** is true.
    
- `and`: triggers only if **both** are true.
