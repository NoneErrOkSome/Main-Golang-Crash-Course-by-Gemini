To cover all the **details from the transcript** you provided — not additional interpretation or explanation — I would divide it into **7 distinct parts**, based on major themes and transitions in the lesson. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### **Part 1: Human Language and If Statement Basics**

- Using if statements in natural language.
    
- Mapping that to Python: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
    
- Condition must be boolean (`True` or `False`).
    

---

### **Part 2: Logical Operators (and/or)**

- Combining multiple conditions.
    
- `or`: only one condition needs to be true.
    
- `and`: both conditions must be true.
    

---

### **Part 3: Writing If Statements in Python**

- Proper syntax: `if` followed by condition and colon.
    
- Indentation is required.
    
- Demonstrating execution with correct vs. incorrect formatting.
    
- Examples with `print`.
    

---

### **Part 4: If-Elif-Else With Conditions**

- Structure:
    
    ```python
    if condition:
        ...
    elif another_condition:
        ...
    else:
        ...
    ```
    
- Importance of spacing and indentation.
    
- Only one branch executes.
    

---

### **Part 5: Flexible Printing & Variable Comparison**

- Using variables (`x1`, `x2`) to compare.
    
- Use of `%g` formatting:
    
    ```python
    print("%g is greater than %g" % (x1, x2))
    ```
    
- Logic for `>`, `<`, `==`.
    

---

### **Part 6: For Loops and Conditional Power Print**

- Nested loops:
    
    ```python
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(5):
            ...
    ```
    
- Use of `if i > 0 and j > 0`.
    
- Printing $i^{-j}$ using display math (LaTeX).
    

---

### **Part 7: Exercise and Display Output**

- Final output should use display function from IPython.
    
- Importing:
    
    ```python
    from IPython.display import display, Math
    ```
    
- Example formatted expression:
    
    ```python
    display(Math("%g^{-%g} = %g" % (i, j, i**(-j))))
    ```
