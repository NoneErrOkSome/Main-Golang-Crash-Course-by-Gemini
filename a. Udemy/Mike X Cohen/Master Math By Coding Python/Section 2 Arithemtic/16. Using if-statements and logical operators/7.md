Here is **Part 7: Exercise and Display Output**, using **only** the details from the transcript and written in **Python with `IPython.display` and `Math`**.

### ðŸ§ª **Part 7: Exercise and Display Output**

---

#### ðŸ§  Concept (from transcript):

- The final task is an exercise:
    
    - Loop over integers `i` from **0 to 3**.
        
    - For each `i`, loop over integers `j` from **0 to 4**.
        
    - For each pair `(i, j)`, **only display** $i^{-j}$ when:
        
        - $i > 0$
            
        - $j > 0$
            
- Use:
    
    - `from IPython.display import display, Math`
        
    - `Math()` to show output in display math mode.
        
- Exponentiation in LaTeX: `^`
    
- Exponentiation in Python: `**`
    

---

#### âœ… Requirements Recap:

- Import correctly.
    
- Use **range-based for-loops**.
    
- Use **logical condition**: `if i > 0 and j > 0`
    
- Use `Math` for LaTeX-style superscript.
    
- Format output as:  
    iâˆ’j=valuei^{-j} = \text{value}  
    E.g.  
    3âˆ’2=0.111111...3^{-2} = 0.111111...
    

---

#### ðŸ§ª Full Working Code (from transcript):

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

for i in range(4):        # i from 0 to 3
    for j in range(5):    # j from 0 to 4
        if i > 0 and j > 0:
            display(Math(r"%g^{-%g} = %g" % (i, j, i**(-j))))
```

---

#### ðŸ“‰ Sample Output (from transcript example):

- When `i = 3` and `j = 4`, the output will be:
    
    3âˆ’4=0.01234573^{-4} = 0.0123457
- The result shows Python's floating-point output.
    
- Some results may **not** look mathematically perfect (e.g. `0.0123457` instead of `\frac{1}{81}`), but this is expected when using `%g`.

This completes **all 7 parts** strictly based on the transcript details.

Would you like me to combine everything into a single `.ipynb` notebook?
