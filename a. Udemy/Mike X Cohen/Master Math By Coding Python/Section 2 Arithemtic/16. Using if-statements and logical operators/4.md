Here is **Part 4: If-Elif-Else With Conditions**, using **only** the details from the transcript and demonstrating with **Python, `IPython.display`, and `Math`**:

### ðŸ”„ **Part 4: If-Elif-Else With Conditions**

---

#### ðŸ§  Concept (from transcript):

- Structure of a **full if-elif-else** block:
    
    - `if` is **required**.
        
    - `elif` (short for **else if**) is **optional**.
        
    - `else` is also **optional**.
        
- Each condition in `if` and `elif` must evaluate to **True or False** (a boolean).
    
- The `else` block **does not** need a condition.
    
- If the `if` condition is **True**, its block runs and **all others are skipped**.
    
- If `if` is **False**, Python checks each `elif`.
    
- If **all previous conditions are False**, Python runs the `else` block.

#### ðŸ§ª Python Code using `display` and `Math`:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

x1 = 3
x2 = 4

if x1 > x2:
    display(Math(r"%g > %g \Rightarrow \text{%g is greater than %g}" % (x1, x2, x1, x2)))
elif x1 < x2:
    display(Math(r"%g < %g \Rightarrow \text{%g is less than %g}" % (x1, x2, x1, x2)))
else:
    display(Math(r"%g = %g \Rightarrow \text{%g is equal to %g}" % (x1, x2, x1, x2)))
```

---

#### ðŸ”Ž Notes from the transcript:

- The `%g` format is used for flexible numeric display.
    
- Copy-pasting code requires **care**: forgetting to update numbers or variables can result in **incorrect output** even if the code runs.
    
- Itâ€™s a good habit to **test all possible conditions**:
    
    - greater than,
        
    - less than,
        
    - equal to.
