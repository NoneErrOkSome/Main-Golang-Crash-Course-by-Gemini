### ðŸ§± **Part 3: Writing If Statements in Python**

---

#### ðŸ§  Concept (from transcript):

- If statements in Python require **correct formatting**:
    
    - You must use a **colon (`:`)** after the condition.
        
    - The body of the if-statement must be **indented (4 spaces)**.
        
- **Example from transcript:**
    
    ```python
    if 4 + 2 == 6:
        print(True)
    ```
    
- `==` is **not** assignment; it's a **comparison operator**.
    
- Without a **colon**, Python throws an error.
    
- Proper indentation lets Python know **what belongs inside** the `if` block.
    
- **Only indented lines** are part of the `if` block.
    
- Lines **not indented** will run **regardless** of the `if` condition.
    
- If a condition is **False**, the `if` block is skipped.
    
- Python raises an **IndentationError** if spacing is inconsistent:
    
    - Code must be aligned at **either 0 or 4 spaces**.

#### ðŸ§ª Python Code using `display` and `Math`:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

# Correct if-statement
if 4 + 2 == 6:
    display(Math(r"4 + 2 = 6 \Rightarrow \text{True}"))
    display(Math(r"\text{This line also runs because it is indented.}"))

# Example of a line outside the if-statement (will always run)
display(Math(r"\text{This line runs regardless of the if-statement.}"))

# False condition: block is skipped
if 4 + 2 == 5:
    display(Math(r"\text{This will not display because the condition is false.}"))
```
