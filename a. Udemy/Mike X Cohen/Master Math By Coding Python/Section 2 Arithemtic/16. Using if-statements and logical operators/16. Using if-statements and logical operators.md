Okay, let's structure the information from the transcript as if it were presented in a Jupyter Notebook, using Markdown cells for explanation and Code cells for the Python examples.

# Learning `if` Statements in Python

**(Markdown Cell)**

This notebook explains `if` statements in Python, a fundamental control flow structure in programming. We'll cover the basic syntax, the use of `elif` and `else`, and how to combine conditions using logical operators `and` and `or`.

You might think `if` statements are complex because they're so important, but they're actually quite intuitive, mirroring how we use conditional logic in everyday language.

**Human Language Analogy:**

*   "**If** it's raining, **then** I will bring an umbrella."
*   "**Else if** it's sunny, **then** I'll buy an ice cream cone."
*   "**Otherwise** (if neither is true), **then** I'll start learning math using Python."

## Python `if` Statement Syntax

The basic structure in Python is similar, with specific syntax:

```python
# General Structure
if boolean_condition_1:
    # Code to run if boolean_condition_1 is True
    # Indentation (usually 4 spaces) is crucial here!
elif boolean_condition_2:
    # Code to run if boolean_condition_1 was False
    # AND boolean_condition_2 is True
else:
    # Code to run if ALL preceding if/elif conditions were False
```

**Key Points:**

1.  **`if <condition>:`**: The condition *must* evaluate to a Boolean (`True` or `False`). The colon (`:`) at the end is mandatory.
2.  **Indentation**: Code belonging to `if`, `elif`, or `else` *must* be indented. This is how Python knows which code block to execute.
3.  **`elif`**: Stands for "else if". It's optional and allows checking multiple conditions sequentially.
4.  **`else`**: Also optional. It acts as a catch-all if none of the `if` or `elif` conditions above it were met. It doesn't have a condition of its own.

## Logical Operators: `and` & `or`

We can combine multiple conditions:

*   **`or`**: The block executes if *at least one* condition is `True`.
    *   Example: `if raining or snowing:` (Learn Python at home)
*   **`and`**: The block executes only if *all* conditions are `True`.
    *   Example: `if sunny and warm:` (Learn Python at the beach)

## Python Examples

Let's see `if` statements in action.

**Example 1: Basic Math Check**

We'll test a simple mathematical equality.

---

**(Code Cell)**

```python
# First attempt - this will cause an error!
# if 4 + 2 == 6
#    print("True")

# Corrected version with the colon:
if 4 + 2 == 6: # The colon is essential!
    print("Yep, 4 + 2 is indeed 6.")
    print("This line also runs because it's indented.")
    # Python knows the block ends when indentation stops.

# What happens if the condition is False?
if 4 + 2 == 5: # This is False
    print("This will NOT be printed.")
else:
    print("The condition '4 + 2 == 5' was False, so the else block ran.")

# Demonstrating indentation determines scope
if 4 + 2 == 5: # False
    print("Still inside the if (won't run)")
print("This line IS NOT part of the if/else, because it's not indented.") # This will run regardless
```

**Example 2: Using Variables and `elif`**

Let's compare two variables and use flexible printing.

---

**(Code Cell)**

```python
x1 = 3
x2 = 4

print(f"Comparing x1={x1} and x2={x2}") # Using f-string for clarity

if x1 > x2:
    # Using flexible printing with %g format specifier
    print("%g is greater than %g" % (x1, x2))
elif x1 < x2: # Check this condition if the 'if' was False
    # Note: We print x2 > x1, which is equivalent to x1 < x2
    print("%g is less than %g (or %g > %g)" % (x1, x2, x2, x1))
else: # If x1 is not > x2 AND x1 is not < x2, they must be equal
    print("%g is equal to %g" % (x1, x2))

# --- Test with different values ---
print("\n--- Testing equality ---")
x1 = 5
x2 = 5
print(f"Comparing x1={x1} and x2={x2}")
if x1 > x2:
    print("%g is greater than %g" % (x1, x2))
elif x1 < x2:
    print("%g is less than %g (or %g > %g)" % (x1, x2, x2, x1))
else:
    print("%g is equal to %g" % (x1, x2))

print("\n--- Testing first condition ---")
x1 = 50
x2 = 4
print(f"Comparing x1={x1} and x2={x2}")
if x1 > x2:
    print("%g is greater than %g" % (x1, x2))
elif x1 < x2:
    print("%g is less than %g (or %g > %g)" % (x1, x2, x2, x1))
else:
    print("%g is equal to %g" % (x1, x2))
```

## Exercise: Nested Loops and Conditional Calculation

**Goal:**

1.  Import the `display` and `math` functions from `IPython.display`.
2.  Create an outer loop for `i` iterating through integers 0, 1, 2, 3.
3.  Create an inner loop for `j` iterating through integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
4.  **Inside the inner loop**: Use an `if` statement to check if **both** `i > 0` **and** `j > 0`.
5.  **If the condition is true**: Calculate `i` raised to the power of `-j` (`i**-j`).
6.  Display the result using `display(Math(...))` for nice mathematical formatting like: `i^{-j} = result`.

**Expected Output Appearance (Sample):**
`1^{-1} = 1.0`
`1^{-2} = 1.0`
...
`2^{-1} = 0.5`
`2^{-2} = 0.25`
...
`3^{-4} = 0.012345679` (or similar floating point representation)

**Exercise Solution**

Let's implement the exercise.

---

**(Code Cell)**

```python
# 1. Import necessary functions
from IPython.display import display, Math

# 2. Outer loop (i from 0 to 3)
# Remember range(start, stop) goes up to stop-1
for i in range(0, 4):
    # 3. Inner loop (j from 0 to 4)
    for j in range(0, 5):
        # 4. Conditional check: i > 0 AND j > 0
        if i > 0 and j > 0:
            # 5. Calculate i**-j
            result = i**(-j)

            # 6. Display using Math formatting
            # LaTeX format: {base}^{exponent} = result
            # We need to substitute i, j, and the result
            display(Math("%g^{-%g} = %g" % (i, j, result)))

# Note: We avoided i=0 or j=0 inside the 'if' block.
# Trying to calculate 0**(-positive number) would lead to a ZeroDivisionError
# because it's equivalent to 1 / (0**positive number) = 1/0.
```
