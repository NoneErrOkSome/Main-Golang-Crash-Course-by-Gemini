Here is **Part 6: For Loops and Conditional Power Print**, using **only** the details from the transcript and written in **Python with `IPython.display` and `Math`**.

### 🔁 **Part 6: For Loops and Conditional Power Print**

---

#### 🧠 Concept (from transcript):

- The exercise requires **two nested loops**:
    
    - Outer loop: `i` from 0 to 3 → `range(4)`
        
    - Inner loop: `j` from 0 to 4 → `range(5)`
        
- Inside the inner loop:
    
    - Print $i^{-j}$ **only if**:
        
        - $i > 0$
            
        - $j > 0$
            
- Use `IPython.display.display` with `Math()` for LaTeX-style math output.
    
- The output should show exponentiation:  
    Example:  
    3−2=0.111...3^{-2} = 0.111...
    

---

#### ⚠️ Error Handling (from transcript):

- Python raises an error if you try to compute $0^{-j}$ or $i^{-0}$ with $i = 0$.
    
- This results in **ZeroDivisionError** or **invalid operation**.
    
- Therefore, include a condition to **skip cases where $i = 0$ or $j = 0$**.

#### 🧪 Python Code:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

for i in range(4):
    for j in range(5):
        if i > 0 and j > 0:
            display(Math(r"%g^{-%g} = %g" % (i, j, i**(-j))))
```

---

#### 🔎 Note:

- `%g^{-%g}` is used to generate LaTeX-style superscripts.
    
- `i**(-j)` computes the actual power.
    
- `%g` formats numbers for display without excessive decimal places.
    
- Indentation and colons are **critical** for loop and conditional blocks.
