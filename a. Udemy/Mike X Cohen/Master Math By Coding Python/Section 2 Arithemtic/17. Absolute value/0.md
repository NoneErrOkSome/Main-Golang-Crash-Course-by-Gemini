To fully cover **only the details from the transcript**, I would divide it into **6 distinct parts**, based on logical and instructional transitions in the video. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Part 1: Concept of Absolute Value**

- A “bad explanation” (strip off negative sign).
    
- A “better explanation” (distance from zero on number line).
    
- Tie-in to complex numbers (why the distance definition is superior).
    

---

### **Part 2: Notation for Absolute Value**

- `abs()` notation in Python.
    
- Mathematical notation using vertical bars: `|x|`.
    
- These match in both math and Python.
    
- Preview of how it looks with `display(Math(...))`.
    

---

### **Part 3: Computing Absolute Value in Python**

- Using `abs()` on constants and variables.
    
- Assigning to variables like `a = -4`, `b = abs(a)`.
    
- Printing two variables together using `print(a, b)`.
    

---

### **Part 4: LaTeX Review and Setup**

- Setting a variable `x = -4.3`.
    
- Writing LaTeX display using `display(Math(...))`.
    
- Placeholder technique: `%g`, then `(x, abs(x))`.
    
- Common mistake: forgetting to import `display` and `Math`.
    
- Fix: `from IPython.display import display, Math`.
    

---

### **Part 5: Exercise Setup – Conditional Absolute Value**

- Create list of numbers: `[-4, 6, -1, 43, -18, 2, 0]`.
    
- Loop through each number using `for numi in numbers`.
    
- Condition: **only print** absolute value if:
    
    - `numi < -5` **or** `numi > 2`.
        
- Otherwise: print "`X is not tested`".
    

---

### **Part 6: Printing Methods & Code Review**

- Using `%g` formatting for math display.
    
- Using `+` with `str(numi)` for string concatenation.
    
- Mixing multiple print methods:
    
    - Regular `print()`
        
    - `display(Math(...))`
        
    - String concatenation
        
- Encouragement to stay consistent but reminder of options.
    
- Final recap: definitions, computing `abs()`, for loops, if-else logic.
