Here is **Part 1: Concept of Absolute Value**, using **only transcript content**, and implemented with **Python, `IPython.display`, and `Math`**.

### üìè **Part 1: Concept of Absolute Value**

---

#### üß† Transcript Concept Summary:

- First, a **bad explanation**:  
    "The absolute value of a number means to strip off the negative sign."  
    ‚Üí This may **work algorithmically**, but it's **not a good definition**.
    
- A **better explanation**:  
    "The absolute value is the **distance** from a number to the **origin** on the number line."
    
- Visual examples from number line:
    
    - The number `2` is **2 units** from zero.
        
    - The number `-5` is **5 units** from zero.
        
    - Therefore:
        
        - $|2| = 2$
            
        - $|-5| = 5$
            
- Why this definition matters:
    
    - It‚Äôs consistent with more advanced math like **complex numbers**.
        
    - For complex numbers, "distance from zero" makes sense.
        
    - The ‚Äústrip the minus sign‚Äù idea does **not** apply to complex numbers.

#### üß™ Python Code using `display` and `Math`:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

# Bad explanation
display(Math(r"\text{Bad explanation: Absolute value means strip off the negative sign.}"))

# Good explanation
display(Math(r"\text{Better explanation: Absolute value means distance from 0 on the number line.}"))

# Visual examples
display(Math(r"\text{Distance from 0 to 2 is 2} \Rightarrow |2| = 2"))
display(Math(r"\text{Distance from 0 to -5 is 5} \Rightarrow |-5| = 5"))

# Complex number reason
display(Math(r"\text{Distance definition works even for complex numbers.}"))
display(Math(r"\text{Stripping a minus sign makes no sense for complex numbers.}"))
```
