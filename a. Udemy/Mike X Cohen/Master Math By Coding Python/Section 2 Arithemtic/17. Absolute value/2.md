Here is **Part 2: Notation for Absolute Value**, using **only transcript content** and implemented with **Python, `IPython.display`, and `Math`**.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Part 2: Notation for Absolute Value**

---

#### üß† Transcript Concept Summary:

- Two main notations for absolute value:
    
    1. **Function notation**:
        
        - `abs(x)` ‚Äî used in **Python**
            
    2. **Mathematical notation**:
        
        - Vertical bars around the variable or number: `|x|`
            
        - These are called the **pipe symbol** in Unix systems.
            
        - Usually typed by pressing **Shift + key above Enter** (may vary by keyboard).
            
- These two notations are **equivalent** in usage and meaning.
    
- In Python, using `abs(x)` is exactly how you compute the absolute value.
    
- In LaTeX, use `|x|` for the same representation in formulas.

#### üß™ Python Code using `display` and `Math`:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Math

# Show both notations
display(Math(r"\text{Function notation: } \quad \texttt{abs(x)}"))
display(Math(r"\text{Mathematical notation: } \quad |x|"))

# Equivalence between them
display(Math(r"\texttt{abs(x)} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad |x|"))

# Example of absolute value
display(Math(r"\text{If } x = -7, \quad \texttt{abs(x)} = |x| = 7"))
```
