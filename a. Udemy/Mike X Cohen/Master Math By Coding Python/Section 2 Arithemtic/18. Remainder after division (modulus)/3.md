Here is **Part 3: Using Modulo Operator in Python**, explained **strictly using details from the transcript**.

### ‚ûó **Part 3: Using Modulo Operator in Python**

---

#### üß† Key Concept from the Transcript:

- The **modulus** or **remainder** is computed in Python using the **percent symbol (`%`)**, known as the **modulo operator**.
    

---

#### üìå Example from Transcript:

```python
a = 10
b = 3
a % b
```

- Output:
    
    ```
    1
    ```
    
- Explanation:
    
    - 3 goes into 10 three times (3 √ó 3 = 9)
        
    - The **leftover** is **1**
        
    - That leftover is the **remainder**, or the **modulus**
        

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Clarification from Transcript:

- This is **not** the same as:
    
    - `a / b` ‚Üí gives decimal division
        
    - `int(a / b)` ‚Üí gives the whole number part of the division
        
- The `%` operator specifically gives the **remainder after division**
