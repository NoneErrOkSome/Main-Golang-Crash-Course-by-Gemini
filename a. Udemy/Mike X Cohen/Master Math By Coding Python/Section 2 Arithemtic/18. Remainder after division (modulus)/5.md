### 🔁 **Part 5: Exercise – Odd or Even Detector Using Modulus**

---

#### 🧠 Goal from Transcript:

- Use the **modulus operator** to determine if numbers are **odd or even**.
    
- Loop through integers **from -5 to +5**:
    
    ```python
    range(-5, 6)
    ```
    

---

#### ✅ Logic (from transcript):

- A number is **even** if it's divisible by 2 with **zero remainder**:
    
    ```python
    if i % 2 == 0
    ```
    
- A number is **odd** if it’s **not** evenly divisible by 2 (i.e., remainder is 1):
    
    ```python
    else
    ```

#### 🧪 Printing the Output (transcript structure):

- For even numbers:
    
    ```python
    print("%g is an even number" % i)
    ```
    
- For odd numbers:
    
    ```python
    print("%g is an odd number" % i)
    ```
    
- Optional improvement from transcript:
    
    - Add a **space** before positive numbers so all output lines align:
        
        ```python
        firstchar = " "
        if i < 0:
            firstchar = ""
        print("%s%g is an even number" % (firstchar, i))
        ```
