To cover **all the details from the transcript**, using **only the transcript's own structure and information**, the content can be clearly divided into **7 parts**, based on the teaching flow, transitions, and instructional segments.

---

### ✅ Breakdown of Parts:

---

### **Part 1: Introduction to Modulus**

- What the modulus/modulo operator means.
    
- Integer division vs. remainder.
    
- Conceptual example: $10 \div 3 = 3$ remainder $1$.
    
- Application: determining odd or even numbers.
    

---

### **Part 2: Computing Division, Integer Division, and Remainder in Python**

- Assign variables `a = 10`, `b = 3`.
    
- Regular division shows decimal.
    
- `int()` function for integer division.
    
- How to get help with functions: `Shift + Tab`.
    

---

### **Part 3: Using Modulo Operator in Python**

- `%` as the modulo operator.
    
- `a % b` gives the remainder.
    
- Example output: `1` for `10 % 3`.
    

---

### **Part 4: Pretty Printing the Division and Remainder**

- Use of:
    
    - `int(a / b)` for quotient
        
    - `a % b` for remainder
        
- String formatting with `%g`
    
- Variables: `division`, `remainder`
    
- Template string:
    
    - `"%g goes into %g %g times with a remainder of %g"`
        

---

### **Part 5: Exercise – Odd or Even Detector Using Modulus**

- Loop through range from `-5` to `+5`.
    
- If `n % 2 == 0`: even.
    
- Else: odd.
    
- Output uses string formatting with `%g` and `%`.
    

---

### **Part 6: Bonus Formatting – Aligning the Output**

- Aligning the word “number” by adding a space.
    
- Aligning integer values to ignore minus sign.
    
- Introduce `firstchar` variable for alignment.
    
- `%s` used for printing the spacing character.
    

---

### **Part 7: Debugging Mistakes and Fixing Logic**

- Common mistakes and how they're debugged:
    
    - Wrong condition: `i > 0` vs. `i < 0`
        
    - Format string argument mismatch
        
- Trial-and-error to correct:
    
    - Condition logic
        
    - Parentheses for multiple arguments
        
- Summary of learned concepts and practical debugging.
