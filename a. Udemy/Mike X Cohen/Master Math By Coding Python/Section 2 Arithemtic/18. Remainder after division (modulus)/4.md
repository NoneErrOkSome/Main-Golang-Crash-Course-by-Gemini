### 🖨️ **Part 4: Pretty Printing the Division and Remainder**

---

#### 🧠 Key Setup from the Transcript:

- Use the same numbers:
    
    ```python
    a = 10
    b = 3
    ```
    
- Compute:
    
    ```python
    division = int(a / b)
    remainder = a % b
    ```
    
- Goal: print a sentence like:  
    “3 goes into 10 three times with a remainder of 1”

#### 🧰 Transcript Method for Printing:

1. First, hardcode the full message as a string:
    
    ```
    3 goes into 10 three times with a remainder of 1
    ```
    
2. Then replace the numbers with placeholders `%g`:
    
    ```
    %g goes into %g %g times with a remainder of %g
    ```
    
3. Use `%` and a tuple of variables to replace:
    
    ```python
    print("%g goes into %g %g times with a remainder of %g" % (b, a, division, remainder))
    ```

#### 📌 Explanation from Transcript:

- `%g` is used for flexible number formatting.
    
- The variables must be in the **correct order**:
    
    - `b` first (divisor)
        
    - `a` second (dividend)
        
    - `division` third (integer quotient)
        
    - `remainder` last (modulus)
