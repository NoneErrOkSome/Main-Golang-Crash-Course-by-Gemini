Here's a concise summary of the key points from your provided transcript:

### **What is Modulus?**

- The modulus is the remainder left over after division.
    
- It is represented using the `%` operator in Python.
    

### **Example:**

When dividing 10 by 3:

- Integer division result: $3$
    
- Modulus result (remainder): $1$
    

In Python:

- Division: $a / b$  
    returns a decimal number (e.g., $10 / 3 = 3.3333...$).
    
- Integer division: $\text{int}(a / b)$  
    returns only the integer portion (e.g., $\text{int}(10 / 3) = 3$).
    
- Modulus: $a % b$  
    returns the remainder (e.g., $10 % 3 = 1$).
    

### **Common Application: Odd or Even**

- Numbers divisible by 2 with no remainder (`number % 2 == 0`) are **even**.
    
- Numbers with a remainder when divided by 2 (`number % 2 != 0`) are **odd**.
    

### **Example Exercise:**

Loop from $-5$ to $+5$ to determine odd/even status:

```python
nums = range(-5, 6)

for i in nums:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("%g is an even number" % i)
    else:
        print("%g is an odd number" % i)
```

### **Formatting for Clarity (Optional):**

- Aligning numbers vertically, regardless of negative signs, by adjusting spacing with conditionals.
    

```python
nums = range(-5, 6)

for i in nums:
    firstchar = " "
    if i < 0:
        firstchar = ""

    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("%s%g is an even number" % (firstchar, i))
    else:
        print("%s%g is an odd number" % (firstchar, i))
```

**Final Output:**

```
-5 is an odd number
-4 is an even number
-3 is an odd number
-2 is an even number
-1 is an odd number
 0 is an even number
 1 is an odd number
 2 is an even number
 3 is an odd number
 4 is an even number
 5 is an odd number
```

### **Debugging Practice:**

- Encountered and resolved logic errors, such as condition misplacement (`>` vs. `<`) and incorrect format strings.
    
- Utilized incremental testing to debug effectively.
