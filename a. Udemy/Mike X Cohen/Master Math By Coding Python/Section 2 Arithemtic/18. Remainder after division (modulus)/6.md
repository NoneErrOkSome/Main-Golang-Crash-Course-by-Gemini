### 📐 **Part 6: Bonus Formatting – Aligning the Output**

---

#### 🎯 Formatting Goals from the Transcript:

1. **Vertically align** the word “number”:
    
    - In early output, `"odd number"` and `"even number"` did **not line up**.
        
    - Fix: **Add a space** before `"number"` to make `"odd number"` and `"even number"` visually aligned.
        
2. **Align integer values**, ignoring minus signs:
    
    - Python by default aligns based on the **first character**, including the minus sign.
        
    - The transcript solution:
        
        - Add a **space before non-negative numbers** so their digits align with negative numbers.

#### 🧰 Implementation from Transcript:

1. Create a **`firstchar` variable**:
    
    ```python
    firstchar = " "
    ```
    
2. Update it for negative numbers:
    
    ```python
    if i < 0:
        firstchar = ""
    ```
    
3. Update the `print` statement to insert `firstchar`:
    
    - Use `%s` for the first character (string), `%g` for the number (integer)
        
    
    ```python
    print("%s%g is an even number" % (firstchar, i))
    ```
    
4. Same update applies to the `else` block for odd numbers:
    
    ```python
    print("%s%g is an odd number" % (firstchar, i))
    ```

#### 📝 Recap from Transcript:

- `%s` is used to format a **string** (`firstchar`)
    
- `%g` is used to format a **number** (`i`)
    
- Wrap both in parentheses:
    
    ```python
    % (firstchar, i)
    ```
    
- This ensures **visual alignment** of both positive and negative numbers, as well as even/odd label.
