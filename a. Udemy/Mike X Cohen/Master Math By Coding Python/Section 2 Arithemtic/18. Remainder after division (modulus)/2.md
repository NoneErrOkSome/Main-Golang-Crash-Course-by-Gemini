---

#### ðŸ§  Key Steps from the Transcript:

1. **Start with two numbers**:
    
    ```python
    a = 10
    b = 3
    ```
    
2. **Regular division**:
    
    - When you write `a / b` in Python, it gives:
        
        ```
        3.333333...
        ```
        
    - Python outputs a **decimal approximation** (not an integer with remainder).
        
    - These decimal 3s **go on forever in theory**, but Python **truncates/rounds** to limited digits.
        
3. **Integer Division** using `int()`:
    
    - To extract just the **integer part** of the division, use:
        
        ```python
        int(a / b)
        ```
        
    - This gives you `3`.

#### ðŸ’¡ Help Feature in Python (Transcript Tip):

- If you're **not sure how a function works**, you can:
    
    - Place your cursor **inside the parentheses**
        
    - Press `Shift + Tab`
        
    - This shows the **help documentation** for the function.
        
    - You might need to **expand the window** using a plus sign `+` to see examples.
        
- Be aware: Python help files often contain **more info than you need**, so take time to find the relevant part.
