### 🛠️ **Part 7: Debugging Mistakes and Fixing Logic**

---

#### 🧠 Debugging Process from the Transcript:

1. **First mistake**: Wrong condition for alignment spacing
    
    - Initially wrote:
        
        ```python
        if i > 0:
            firstchar = ""
        ```
        
    - This caused output to look worse (pushed negative numbers further right)
        
    - **Fix**: Reverse the condition:
        
        ```python
        if i < 0:
            firstchar = ""
        ```

#### ❌ Common Error from Transcript:

- Forgot to provide **enough arguments** in a formatted print statement:
    
    ```python
    print("%s%g is an even number" % firstchar)  # ❌
    ```
    
- **Error Message**:
    
    ```
    not enough arguments for format string
    ```
    
- **Fix**: Wrap arguments in parentheses to pass as a tuple:
    
    ```python
    print("%s%g is an even number" % (firstchar, i))
    ```

#### 🧪 Debugging Strategy in Transcript:

- Sometimes it’s **useful to run broken code** just to **see the error** and learn from it.
    
- This helps understand:
    
    - What Python expects
        
    - Where the mismatch is

#### ✅ Final Correction Logic:

1. **Initialize** `firstchar = " "`
    
2. **Condition**:
    
    ```python
    if i < 0:
        firstchar = ""
    ```
    
3. **Apply in both even and odd print blocks** using:
    
    ```python
    print("%s%g is an even/odd number" % (firstchar, i))
    ```

#### 🧾 Summary (from transcript conclusion):

- You learned:
    
    - What the **modulus** means (remainder after division)
        
    - How to use `%` to check if a number is **odd or even**
        
    - How to use **real-time debugging** to fix logic and formatting
        
    - How to write cleaner, visually aligned outputs using formatted strings
