### üßÆ **Part 1: Introduction to Modulus (Remainder After Division)**

---

#### üß† Key Ideas from the Transcript:

- **Modulus** (also called the **remainder after division**) is a simple concept.
    
- The **modulo operator** tells us what is **left over** when one number is divided by another.
    
- This is different from normal division.

#### üìå Example:

- When you divide **10 by 3**, the answer is:
    
    - **3** with a **remainder of 1**
        
    - This is **integer division**:
        
        - 3 goes into 10 exactly **3 times** (ignoring the leftover)
            
        - But 3 √ó 3 = 9, so **1 unit remains**
            
- That leftover **1** is the **modulus**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Clarification:

- **This number is not** the result of regular division (which gives 3.333...).
    
- It is also **not** the integer part (which is just 3).
    
- The **modulo operator in Python** gives you **only the remainder**, not the full division result.
