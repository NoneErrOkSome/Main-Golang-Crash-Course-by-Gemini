### 📘 **Part 7 — Final Summary and Transition to Next Topic**

---

- With all three functions working (`powers`, `division`, and `main`), the speaker wraps up the lesson.
    

---

#### ✅ Final State of the Program:

- The program now supports:
    
    - **User input** for two numbers (`x`, `y`)
        
    - A **function switch** to choose between:
        
        - Computing $x^y$
            
        - Computing $x \div y$
            
    - Input can now be either **integers** or **decimals** (thanks to `float()`)

#### 🧪 Recap of Working Scenarios:

1. **Power Operation:**
    
    - Input:
        
        ```
        x = 2.3  
        y = 4.1  
        switch = 1
        ```
        
    - Output:
        
        ```
        2.3 to the power of 4.1 equals 30.4147...
        ```
        
2. **Division Operation:**
    
    - Input:
        
        ```
        x = 2  
        y = 4  
        switch = 2
        ```
        
    - Output:
        
        ```
        2 divided by 4 equals 0.5
        ```
        
3. **Invalid Switch:**
    
    - Input:
        
        ```
        switch = 3
        ```
        
    - Output:
        
        ```
        Invalid selection
        ```

#### 🔄 Key Improvements Recap:

- Replaced `int()` with `float()` to handle decimal input
    
- Used `display()` and LaTeX formatting for clean visual output
    
- Structured logic using multiple small functions
    
- Controlled execution with an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement

#### 💬 Final Encouragement:

> “I hope you are starting to feel more confident in your ability to create and use functions in Python as a way to help you learn mathematics.”
