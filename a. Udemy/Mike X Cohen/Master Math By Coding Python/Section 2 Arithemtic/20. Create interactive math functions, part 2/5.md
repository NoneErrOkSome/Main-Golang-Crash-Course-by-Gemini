### üìò **Part 5 ‚Äî Controlling Program Flow with If-Statements**

---

- The speaker begins adding logic to **choose which function to call** based on user input:
    

> ‚ÄúThe last thing we need to do is call either the `powers` function or the `division` function, or print out an invalid selection warning message, depending on the value of `switch`.‚Äù

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Type Check:

- Earlier, `x` and `y` were wrapped in `int()`:
    
    ```python
    x = int(input("Input x: "))
    y = int(input("Input y: "))
    ```
    
- But `switch` was not:
    
    ```python
    switch = input("Which algorithm to compute: ")
    ```
    
- So `switch` remains a **string**.
    

---

#### üîÅ If-Else Logic:

```python
if switch == '1':
    powers(x, y)
elif switch == '2':
    division(x, y)
else:
    print("Invalid selection")
```

- Uses string comparisons: `'1'` and `'2'`, **not** numbers

#### üß™ Test 1 ‚Äî Valid Power Selection:

```plaintext
Input x: 2  
Input y: 4  
Which algorithm to compute: 1
```

- Output:
    

```
2 to the power of 4 equals 16
```

‚úÖ Correct

---

#### üß™ Test 2 ‚Äî Valid Division Selection:

```plaintext
Input x: 2  
Input y: 4  
Which algorithm to compute: 2
```

- Output:
    

```
2 divided by 4 equals 0.5
```

‚úÖ Correct

---

#### üß™ Test 3 ‚Äî Invalid Input:

```plaintext
Input x: 2  
Input y: 4  
Which algorithm to compute: 3
```

- Output:
    

```
Invalid selection
```

‚úÖ Correct handling of unexpected input

---

- The speaker adds:
    

> ‚ÄúThree exclamation points is probably a little bit overkill.‚Äù

- Chooses to keep it simple and informative instead.
    

---

- Final confirmation:
    

> ‚ÄúI'm going to run that cell to recompile all this code and I'm going to type `main()`...‚Äù

- Verifies each case works correctly.
    

---

- ‚úÖ At this stage:
    
    - The program collects user input
        
    - Displays formatted instructions
        
    - Runs either `powers()` or `division()` correctly
        
    - Handles invalid choices with an error message
        
- The next improvement will be: **supporting decimal numbers** using `float()` instead of `int()`.
