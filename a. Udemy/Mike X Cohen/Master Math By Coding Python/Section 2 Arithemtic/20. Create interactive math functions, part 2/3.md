### 📘 **Part 3 — Creating and Testing the `division(x, y)` Function**

---

- The speaker now moves on to define the **second function** for the challenge:
    
    > “So now I want to create the other function. And that's for divisions.”
    

---

#### 🔧 `division(x, y)` function:

- The speaker **copies and pastes** the previous `powers()` function as a base.
    
- Reminder: when copy-pasting code, **you must carefully edit** the relevant parts.
    

```python
def division(x, y):
    z = x / y
    print("%g divided by %g equals %g" % (x, y, z))
```

---

- 📐 Initially, the speaker tries to use **LaTeX formatting** for fractions:
    
    - Mentions `\frac{...}{...}` as the proper LaTeX syntax for fractions
        
    - Incorporates this into the display output
        

---

- 🧪 First run (with unedited math logic):
    
    - Code still computes `x ** y` (copied from powers function)
        
    - Function name changed to `division()`, but math logic still incorrect
        
    - Output:
        
        ```
        2 divided by 4 equals 16
        ```
        
        ❌ Incorrect
        
- 💡 Realizes mistake:
    
    > “The problem here is that I only changed the display part... I didn't actually change the math.”
    
- 🛠️ Fix applied:
    
    - Change `x ** y` to `x / y`
        

---

- ✅ Second test:
    
    ```python
    division(2, 4)
    ```
    
    - Output:
        
        ```
        2 divided by 4 equals 0.5
        ```
        
- Confirmed correct behavior.
    

---

#### 🚨 Division by Zero Test:

- The speaker tries:
    
    ```python
    division(4, 0)
    ```
    
- Output:
    
    ```
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    ```
    
- Comment:
    
    > “That is illegal in mathematics. If you tried to do this the math police are going to come after you.”
    
- The speaker quickly **moves on** and **clears the error** from the notebook.
    

---

- ✅ Now, both the `powers(x, y)` and `division(x, y)` functions are complete and working.
    
- Up next: creating the **third function**, which will control input and call one of the two based on the user’s selection.
