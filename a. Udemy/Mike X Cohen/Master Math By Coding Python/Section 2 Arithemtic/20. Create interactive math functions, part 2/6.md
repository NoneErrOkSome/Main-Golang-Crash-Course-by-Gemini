**📘 Part 6 — Supporting Decimal Inputs Using `float()` (continued from part 5)**

---

- At the end of Part 5, the code correctly handled integer inputs using:
    
    ```python
    x = int(input("Input x: "))
    y = int(input("Input y: "))
    ```
    
- The speaker now wants to test what happens if the user enters **decimal numbers**.

#### 🧪 Test with Decimal Input:

```plaintext
Input x: 2.3  
```

- Immediately throws an error:
    

> “And we already get an error.”

- Reason:
    
    - `int("2.3")` is invalid because `int()` can only convert strings that look like whole numbers.
        
    - Python raises:
        
        ```
        ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2.3'
        ```
        

---

#### 💡 Fix: Use `float()` Instead of `int()`

> “Turns out that the solution here is pretty straightforward. We just type `float` instead of `int`.”

- Code update:
    

```python
x = float(input("Input x: "))
y = float(input("Input y: "))
```

---

- 🧠 Explanation:
    
    - `int` is for whole numbers like `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
        
    - `float` (floating point) is for numbers that can include a decimal, like `2.3` or `4.1`.
        

---

#### 🧪 Retest with Floats:

```plaintext
Input x: 2.3  
Input y: 4.1  
Which algorithm to compute: 1
```

- Output:
    
    ```
    2.3 to the power of 4.1 equals 30.4147...
    ```
    

✅ Successful — program now supports **non-integer input**

- The speaker comments:
    

> “Pretty interesting piece of knowledge to have.”

- 🎯 Final thoughts for the video:
    

> “So I hope you are starting to feel more confident in your ability to create and use functions in Python as a way to help you learn mathematics.”
