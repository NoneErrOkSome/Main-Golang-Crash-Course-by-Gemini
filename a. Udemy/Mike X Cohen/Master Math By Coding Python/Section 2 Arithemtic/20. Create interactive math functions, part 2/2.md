### 📘 **Part 2 — Multiple Valid Solutions and Defining the `powers()` Function**

---

- Before diving into the solution, the speaker shares a principle of programming:
    
    > “There are often **multiple ways to correctly solve a problem** using Python or MATLAB or C or any other computer language.”
    
- Viewers are encouraged:
    
    > “If your solution looks different from my solution, that’s totally fine.”
    
    > “As long as you get the right answer, the way that you got to that right answer really doesn’t matter.”
    

---

- 🔧 The speaker begins building the solution by creating the **first of three functions**.
    

#### 🧮 `powers(x, y)` function:

- Purpose: to compute and display $x^y$
    

```python
def powers(x, y):
    z = x ** y
    print("%g to the power of %g equals %g" % (x, y, z))
```

- Explanation of steps:
    
    - Takes two arguments: `x` and `y`
        
    - Calculates `z = x ** y`  
        → `**` is Python’s syntax for exponentiation
        
    - Prints the formatted result using `%g`
        

---

- 🧪 **Speaker adds visual formatting** using **LaTeX-style math display**:
    
    - Tries to use `display()` and `math` to present result nicely
        
    - Intends to display output in this form:  
        xy=zx^y = z
        
- But after running the cell:
    
    - ❌ **Error occurs**:
        
        ```
        NameError: name 'math' is not defined
        ```
        

---

- 🛠️ **Fixing the error:**
    
    - Add the following imports:
        

```python
from IPython.display import display
import math
```

- These are required because:
    
    - `display()` is not part of standard Python — it comes from `IPython.display`
        
    - `math` is a module that provides mathematical functions
        

---

- ✅ Re-run the cell after imports:
    
    - Run `powers(2, 4)`
        
    - Output confirms:
        
        ```
        2 to the power of 4 equals 16
        ```
        

---

- 🧠 The speaker adds a math insight:
    
    > “One way you can think about this is by breaking this up into $2^2 \times 2^2$.”
    
    > “And that is possible because of the **law of exponents**.”
    
    - $2^2 = 4$, and $4 \times 4 = 16$

- 🚧 Closing remark:
    
    > “We are not yet finished this project but we’re getting there.”
