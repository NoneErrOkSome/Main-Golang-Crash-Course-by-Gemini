### 📘 **Part 4 — Building the `main()` Function for Input and Selection**

---

- With `powers(x, y)` and `division(x, y)` done, the speaker begins the **third function**:
    

> “Now I'm going to create a third function and that is going to be the main function that will give the inputs and call one of these two functions depending on what I specify for inputs.”

---

#### 🔧 Defining `main()`:

```python
def main():
    x = int(input("Input x: "))
    y = int(input("Input y: "))
    switch = input("Which algorithm to compute: ")
```

- Inputs:
    
    - `x`: user-provided integer
        
    - `y`: user-provided integer
        
    - `switch`: choice of which function to run
        

---

- 🧪 First test:
    
    - Function is defined and run
        
    - Speaker enters: `x = 5`, `y = 3`, and a long number for `switch`
        
    - No error — success at this stage
        

---

- 💬 Speaker recalls the earlier instructions shown in the video:
    
    > “In the slides, I showed that it should print out nice-looking text that gives the two options…”
    
- Therefore, before asking for the `switch`, the function is updated to include a **LaTeX-formatted message** using `display()`.
    

---

#### 🖨️ Adding instructions with LaTeX:

```python
display(Math("Press 1 to compute %g to the power of %g or press 2 to compute %g divided by %g" % (x, y, x, y)))
```

- This line is added **before** the input for `switch`.
    

---

- 🧪 Run and error:
    
    - User tries `main()` again with `x = 3`, `y = 5`
        
    - Error appears
        

> “I actually had to pause the video and look at this for a good 10 seconds before I figured out what was actually going wrong.”

---

#### ❌ Mistake identified:

- Problem: incorrect placement of `%`-replacement tuple
    
- Fix: move the tuple immediately after the `"` string ends
    

```python
display(Math("..." % (...)))
```

---

- 🧪 Retest:
    
    - Inputs: `x = 3`, `y = 2`
        
    - Output: message appears
        
    - But result looks **italicized** and **lacks spacing**
        

---

#### 💡 Fixing LaTeX text formatting:

- LaTeX interprets strings as math variables by default
    
- Solution: wrap the text in `\text{...}` to preserve spaces and formatting
    

```python
display(Math("\\text{Press 1 to compute %g to the power of %g or press 2 to compute %g divided by %g}" % (x, y, x, y)))
```

---

- 🧪 Final test for this part:
    
    - Inputs: `x = 3`, `y = 2`
        
    - Output:
        
        ```
        Press 1 to compute 3 to the power of 2 or press 2 to compute 3 divided by 2
        ```
        

✅ Looks correct now — both spacing and content are displaying as expected.

---

- Speaker notes:
    

> “This is looking good. We are almost finished here.”

- Next step will be adding an **`if` statement** to handle the `switch` logic.
