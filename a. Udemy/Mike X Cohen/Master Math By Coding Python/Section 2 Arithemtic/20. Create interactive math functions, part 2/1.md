### 📘 **Part 1 — Challenge Overview and Input Requirements**

---

- The video begins with the speaker stating:
    
    > “This video is basically a continuation of the previous video on creating functions in Python.”
    
- Viewers who are **not comfortable** with creating functions are advised to:
    
    > “go back and rewatch the previous video.”
    

---

- The speaker introduces the **structure of this video**:
    
    > “This is like a challenge. This is a big exercise, this whole video.”
    
- 🧩 **The challenge:**
    
    - Create a **function** that takes **three inputs**.
        
    - These inputs must be **user-defined** (entered interactively).
        
    - The inputs are:
        
        1. `x` value (integer)
            
        2. `y` value (integer)
            
        3. a **function switch**

- The speaker demonstrates an example:
    
    1. Python prompts: `Input x:`  
        → user types `2`
        
    2. Python prompts: `Input y:`  
        → user types `4`
        
    3. Python then prints the instructions:
        
        ```
        Press 1 to compute 2 to the 4
        or press 2 to compute 2 divided by 4
        ```
        
    4. If the user selects `2`, the output is:
        
        ```
        2 divided by 4 equals 0.5
        ```
        

---

- Another example is given:
    
    - User inputs: `3` and `5`
        
    - Then prompted to press either `1` or `2`
        
    - Instead, the user presses `3`
        
    - Python responds with:
        
        ```
        invalid selection
        ```
        

---

- 💡 **Hint from the speaker:**
    
    > “Don’t try to do this all in one function.”
    
- Instead, the speaker suggests:
    
    > “You can actually create **three separate functions** in order to get this to work.”
    

---

- Final guidance before pausing:
    
    > “Pause the video, work your way through, make sure you can implement these functions…”
    
    > “...and get output that would look something like this or something like this.”
    

---

- The speaker ends this part by saying:
    
    > “When you’re ready to come back, then come back to the video, and I’m now going to switch to Python and show you how I solved this problem.”
