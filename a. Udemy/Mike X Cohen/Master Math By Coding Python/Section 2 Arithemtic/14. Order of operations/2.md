**Part 2: The Official Order of Operations (PEMDAS)**

---

### 🔠 What Is PEMDAS?

PEMDAS is a standard rule that tells us **which operations to perform first** in a math expression — especially when multiple operations are mixed together like addition, multiplication, and so on.

The acronym stands for:

- **P** – Parentheses
    
- **E** – Exponents
    
- **MD** – Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
    
- **AS** – Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

### 🔁 Full Expansion

|Symbol|Meaning|Priority Level|
|---|---|---|
|P|Do all **parentheses** first|1st (highest)|
|E|Then do **exponents**|2nd|
|M / D|Then do **multiplication or division**, left to right|3rd|
|A / S|Then do **addition or subtraction**, left to right|4th (lowest)|

### 🧠 Important Notes About PEMDAS

1. **Multiplication and division** are treated **equally** — you go **left to right**, not always multiplication first.
    
2. **Addition and subtraction** are also **equal priority** — also go **left to right**.
    
3. Parentheses always **override** the default order — they act as grouping tools to force evaluation.

### 🧪 Example (Using PEMDAS)

Expression:

```plaintext
4 + 3 * 2 - 1
```

Apply PEMDAS:

1. No parentheses ✔
    
2. No exponents ✔
    
3. Do multiplication first:
    
    - $3 \times 2 = 6$
        
4. Then do addition and subtraction from left to right:
    
    - $4 + 6 = 10$
        
    - $10 - 1 = 9$
        

✅ Correct answer: **9**

### 🎓 Memory Trick: “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”

That’s just a way to remember:  
**P**arentheses  
**E**xponents  
**M**ultiplication  
**D**ivision  
**A**ddition  
**S**ubtraction

---

### ⚖️ Tie-Breaker Rule: Left to Right

- For **M and D**, whichever comes first as you move left to right is done first.
    
- Same with **A and S**.
    

Example:

```plaintext
20 / 5 * 2
```

Even though `*` comes after `/` in PEMDAS, you go **left to right**:

- First: $20 \div 5 = 4$
    
- Then: $4 \times 2 = 8$
    

✅ Answer: **8**

### ✅ Recap

- PEMDAS gives a strict rule for evaluating mixed operations
    
- Parentheses come first, then powers, then multiply/divide, then add/subtract
    
- M/D and A/S have **equal priority**, resolved **left to right**
    
- Use PEMDAS to avoid ambiguity and always get consistent answers
    

In **Part 3**, we’ll walk through the full expression $4 + 3 \times 2 - 1$ step-by-step using PEMDAS, and compare it with incorrect groupings. Ready to proceed?
