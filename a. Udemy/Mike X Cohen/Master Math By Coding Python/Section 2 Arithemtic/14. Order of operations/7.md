**Part 7: Final Summary – Order of Operations in Python**

---

You’ve now completed the full lesson on **Order of Operations**, both in **math logic** and in **Python code**. This final part wraps everything together — highlighting what you’ve learned, how to use it practically, and how it prepares you for writing clearer, smarter code.

---

### 🎯 What You Learned

Let’s summarize each concept:

---

#### ✅ 1. Expressions Can Be Ambiguous

Expression:

```plaintext
4 + 3 * 2 - 1
```

can mean different things depending on **how it’s grouped**. That’s why we need a **rule**.

---

#### ✅ 2. PEMDAS Is the Rule

PEMDAS defines evaluation order:

1. **P** → Parentheses
    
2. **E** → Exponents
    
3. **MD** → Multiplication & Division (left to right)
    
4. **AS** → Addition & Subtraction (left to right)
    

Use the mnemonic:  
**Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally**

---

#### ✅ 3. Python Automatically Follows PEMDAS

Python treats:

```python
print(4 + 3 * 2 - 1)
```

as:

- $3 \times 2 = 6$
    
- $4 + 6 = 10$
    
- $10 - 1 = 9$
    

✅ Result: `9`

---

#### ✅ 4. Spacing Means Nothing to Python

You can write:

```python
print(4+3*2-1)
```

Or even:

```python
print(       4        +    3     *   2 -      1   )
```

Same result every time:  
✅ Spacing is for **you**, not for Python.

---

#### ✅ 5. Parentheses Override Everything

If you want to control evaluation, use parentheses:

```python
print((4 + 3) * (2 - 1))  # Result: 7
```

No matter what PEMDAS says, parentheses take **top priority**.

---

#### ✅ 6. Reasoning First, Then Coding

In the two exercises:

- You first **thought through** what the result should be
    
- Then you **added parentheses** logically
    
- This gave you full control over Python’s math
    

Example:

```python
print((4 * 5) / (7 + 3))  # Result: 2.0
print(9 / (3 + 6) - 1)    # Result: 0.0
```

✅ Clean, deliberate, predictable code

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters Going Forward

- You’ll write clearer code
    
- You’ll debug faster when something goes wrong
    
- You’ll think like both a **mathematician** and a **programmer**
    

---

### 💡 Pro Tip

In real-world coding:

- Don’t rely on “default” behavior if it could confuse others
    
- Use parentheses **even when not required** if it helps clarity
    

```python
# Better readability, even if not required
area = (length * width)
```
