**Part 6: Exercises — Using Parentheses to Make Expressions Equal Target Values**

---

Now that you’ve mastered how **parentheses override order**, it’s time to apply what you learned through **hands-on exercises**.

You’re given two expressions in Python that do **not** initially evaluate to the correct answer.

Your goal:  
✔️ Add parentheses  
✔️ Change the grouping  
✔️ Make them equal the **target number** shown

---

### 🧪 Exercise 1

#### 🧾 Problem:

```python
print(4 * 5 / 7 + 3)
```

🎯 Target: `2`

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

#### ❌ Step 1: Run the default expression (no parentheses)

```python
print(4 * 5 / 7 + 3)
```

PEMDAS rules:

- First: $4 \times 5 = 20$
    
- Then: $20 \div 7 = 2.857...$
    
- Then: $2.857 + 3 = 5.857$
    

❌ This is **not** `2`

---

#### 🧠 Step 2: Think of what result we need

Target is `2`.

Ask yourself:

> What kind of combination of numbers would give me 2?

Let’s try:

- $4 \times 5 = 20$
    
- What if the denominator is 10?
    
- $20 \div 10 = 2$
    

That means we want this:

```plaintext
(4 * 5) / (7 + 3)
```

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Code it with parentheses

```python
print((4 * 5) / (7 + 3))
```

✔️ Output: `2.0`

✅ Success!

---

#### ✨ Bonus: Clean formatting

Remove extra spaces to improve clarity:

```python
print((4*5)/(7+3))
```

---

### 🧪 Exercise 2

#### 🧾 Problem:

```python
print(9 / 3 + 6 - 1)
```

🎯 Target: `0`

---

#### ❌ Step 1: Run the default expression

```python
print(9 / 3 + 6 - 1)
```

PEMDAS:

- $9 \div 3 = 3$
    
- $3 + 6 = 9$
    
- $9 - 1 = 8$
    

❌ Wrong — we want `0`

---

#### 🧠 Step 2: Try to group differently

We want to turn this into something that becomes `0`.

Let’s mentally try:

- Group `3 + 6 = 9`
    
- $9 \div 9 = 1$
    
- $1 - 1 = 0$
    

Perfect!

That means we need:

```python
9 / (3 + 6) - 1
```

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Code with parentheses

```python
print(9 / (3 + 6) - 1)
```

✔️ Output: `0.0`

✅ Works!

---

#### ✨ Bonus: Cleaner version

```python
print(9/(3+6)-1)
```

### 🧠 Recap of What You Practiced

|Original Expression|Parentheses Used|Result|
|---|---|---|
|`4 * 5 / 7 + 3`|`(4 * 5) / (7 + 3)`|`2`|
|`9 / 3 + 6 - 1`|`9 / (3 + 6) - 1`|`0`|
