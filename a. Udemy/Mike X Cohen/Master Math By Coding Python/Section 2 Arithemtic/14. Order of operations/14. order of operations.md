## 🧠 **Core Concept: Order of Operations**

### 🔢 Importance

- Essential in both **arithmetic** and **programming** (especially Python).
    
- Helps determine how expressions are evaluated when **multiple operations** are involved.
    

### 🎯 Goal

Understand:

- How the **same expression** can yield **different results** based on how it’s grouped.
    
- Why Python follows a specific order when evaluating expressions.
    
- Why **spacing** is for human readability but **parentheses** control the actual grouping in code.

## 🔍 **Key Arithmetic Example**

Expression:  
`4 + 3 × 2 − 1`

### 📚 Possible Interpretations

- (4 + 3) × 2 − 1 = 13
    
- (4 + 3) × (2 − 1) = 7
    
- 4 + (3 × 2 − 1) = 9 ✅
    
- 4 + (6 − 1) = 9
    
- (4 + 6) − 1 = 9
    
- (4 + 3) × 2 − 1 = 13
    
- 4 + 3 × (2 − 1) = 7
    

Different groupings give different results.

## ✅ **Correct Answer: 9**

### 💡 Why?

- Python (and math) follows **Order of Operations**.
    
- **Multiplication** comes before **addition/subtraction**.
    
- So:  
    `4 + (3 × 2) − 1`  
    → `4 + 6 − 1`  
    → `10 − 1`  
    → `9`

## 📏 **Order of Operations (PEMDAS)**

A hierarchy to evaluate expressions:

1. **P** – Parentheses
    
2. **E** – Exponents
    
3. **MD** – Multiplication & Division (left to right)
    
4. **AS** – Addition & Subtraction (left to right)
    

Mnemonic: **"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"**

⚠️ Note:

- **Multiplication/Division** and **Addition/Subtraction** are handled **left to right** when on the same level.
    

---

## 🧠 **Left-to-Right Rule**

- If operators are on the **same level** (e.g., + and −), evaluate **from left to right**.
    
- Examples:
    
    - `4 + 6 − 1` → `10 − 1` → `9`
        
    - `4 ÷ 2 × 3` → `2 × 3` → `6`

## 🐍 **Python Implementation**

### 🖨️ Basic Example

```python
print(4 + 3 * 2 - 1)  # Output: 9
```

### 📏 Spacing

- Python **ignores spaces**.
    
- Spaces help **humans** visualize grouping but don’t affect execution.
    

```python
print(4 +     3     *     2     -    1)  # Still 9
```

### 🧩 Parentheses

Control the evaluation:

```python
print((4 + 3) * (2 - 1))  # Output: 7
```

---

## 🧪 **Two Practice Exercises (with solutions)**

### 🧠 Problem 1

Expression:  
`4 * 5 / 7 + 3`

Goal: Make it equal to `2`.

#### ✅ Solution

```python
print((4 * 5) / (7 + 3))  # Output: 2.0
```

#### 🔍 Breakdown

- 4 × 5 = 20
    
- 7 + 3 = 10
    
- 20 / 10 = 2
    

➡️ Parentheses required only for denominator.  
Multiplication has higher precedence than division, so no need to parenthesize `4 * 5`.

---

### 🧠 Problem 2

Expression:  
`9 / 3 + 6 - 1`

Goal: Make it equal to `0`.

#### ✅ Solution

```python
print(9 / (3 + 6) - 1)  # Output: 0.0
```

#### 🔍 Breakdown

- 3 + 6 = 9
    
- 9 / 9 = 1
    
- 1 - 1 = 0
    

➡️ Parentheses required around `3 + 6`.  
Division comes before subtraction, so no need to parenthesize subtraction part.

---

## 💡 Best Practices in Python

- Use **parentheses** to clarify **intended grouping**.
    
- **Spaces** enhance readability for **humans**, not computers.
    
- Even if parentheses are not strictly required by Python due to order, use them when they help humans understand the grouping.
    

---

## ✨ Final Takeaways

- Understand and apply **PEMDAS** to avoid misinterpretation.
    
- Always verify expressions with a programming language (like Python) for clarity.
    
- Don't randomly add parentheses—**analyze** what answer you want and apply the rules deliberately.
