To cover all the details from this **Order of Operations** lesson thoroughly, I recommend breaking it down into **7 parts**, just like before. Each part will build clearly and progressively to support deep understanding, especially when code and math overlap.

### üßÆ Breakdown of the 7 Parts

**Part 1: What Is Order of Operations and Why It Matters**

- Introduce ambiguity in arithmetic
    
- Show multiple ways to group the same expression
    
- Explain why different groupings give different results
    
- Raise the question of: ‚ÄúWhich is correct?‚Äù
    

**Part 2: The Official Order of Operations**

- Introduce PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction
    
- Explain that multiplication and division are equal in priority (left to right)
    
- Explain the same for addition/subtraction
    
- Clarify how to resolve ambiguity using this hierarchy
    

**Part 3: Applying PEMDAS by Hand**

- Go through example: `4 + 3 * 2 - 1`
    
- Show why the correct answer is 9 using PEMDAS
    
- Compare to other interpretations and explain why they're incorrect
    
- Discuss importance of left-to-right evaluation for equal-precedence operations
    

**Part 4: Implementing It in Python**

- Write the expression in Python
    
- Show that spacing doesn‚Äôt affect results
    
- Confirm PEMDAS is used by default in Python
    
- Emphasize that **spacing is for humans**, not for Python
    

**Part 5: Overriding Default Order Using Parentheses**

- Demonstrate how parentheses change the outcome
    
- Show different groupings (e.g. `(4 + 3) * (2 - 1)`)
    
- Confirm how Python honors parentheses above all
    
- Show that excessive spacing is ignored but parentheses are respected
    

**Part 6: Exercise 1 ‚Äì Make an Expression Equal 2**

- Start with: `4 * 5 / 7 + 3`
    
- Guide through:
    
    - How to reason through grouping mentally
        
    - How to use parentheses in Python
        
    - How to clean up spacing for better readability
        
- End with final correct version that outputs `2`
    

**Part 7: Exercise 2 ‚Äì Make an Expression Equal 0**

- Start with: `9 / 3 + 6 - 1`
    
- Guide through:
    
    - Observing patterns to reach 0
        
    - Identifying the correct grouping using PEMDAS
        
    - Avoiding guesswork ‚Äî instead using logic
        
- Final result: clean, grouped code that produces `0`
