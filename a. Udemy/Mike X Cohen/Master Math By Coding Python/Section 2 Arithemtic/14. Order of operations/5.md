**Part 5: Overriding PEMDAS with Parentheses in Python**

---

In this part, you'll learn how **to override Python’s default order of operations** by using **parentheses**. This gives you full control over **how** and **when** things are evaluated — and it's the key to writing **clear, correct, and predictable** code.

### 🔄 Recap of Python's Default Behavior

In Part 4, we saw this line:

```python
print(4 + 3 * 2 - 1)
```

✅ Output: `9`

That’s because Python uses PEMDAS:

- $3 \times 2 = 6$
    
- $4 + 6 = 10$
    
- $10 - 1 = 9$
    

But what if we want a **different result** by **changing the grouping**?

That’s where **parentheses** come in.

### 🔁 Using Parentheses to Override Default Evaluation

#### 💡 Example 1: Group Addition First

```python
print((4 + 3) * 2 - 1)
```

Step-by-step:

- $4 + 3 = 7$
    
- $7 \times 2 = 14$
    
- $14 - 1 = 13$
    

✅ Output: `13`

Notice: changing one pair of parentheses gave a completely different result.

---

#### 💡 Example 2: Group Subtraction First

```python
print((2 - 1))          # 1
print(4 + 3 * (2 - 1))  # 4 + 3 * 1 = 7
```

So:

- $2 - 1 = 1$
    
- $3 \times 1 = 3$
    
- $4 + 3 = 7$
    

✅ Output: `7`

---

#### 💡 Example 3: Group Everything

```python
print((4 + 3) * (2 - 1))  # 7 * 1 = 7
```

✅ Output: `7`

---

### 🧠 Important Observations

- **Parentheses always come first**, regardless of what operation is inside
    
- **Spacing still does nothing** to change behavior
    
- You can **nest** parentheses inside each other to build complex expressions
    

---

### 🪜 Order Within Parentheses

When you do something like:

```python
print((4 + 3) * (2 - 1))
```

Python does:

1. Compute each **parenthesized group** independently
    
2. Then apply multiplication between the two results
    

---

### 🎓 Visual vs Actual Behavior

This line:

```python
print(4 + 3     *     2 - 1)
```

Might "look" like:

$$ (4 + 3) \times (2 - 1) = 7 \times 1 = 7 $$

But it is actually:

$$ 3 \times 2 = 6,\quad 4 + 6 = 10,\quad 10 - 1 = 9 $$

✅ Python ignores visual spacing — **you must use parentheses** to get what you intend.

---

### 🧪 Test This Yourself

Try writing these 3 lines in a Jupyter cell and observe:

```python
print(4 + 3 * 2 - 1)           # 9 (default PEMDAS)
print((4 + 3) * 2 - 1)         # 13 (addition grouped)
print((4 + 3) * (2 - 1))       # 7 (both sides grouped)
```

---

### ✅ Summary

|Expression|Output|Reason|
|---|---|---|
|`4 + 3 * 2 - 1`|`9`|Default PEMDAS|
|`(4 + 3) * 2 - 1`|`13`|Addition grouped|
|`4 + 3 * (2 - 1)`|`7`|Subtraction grouped|
|`(4 + 3) * (2 - 1)`|`7`|Both addition & subtraction grouped|

---

### ✍️ Key Takeaway

Use parentheses to:

- **Override default precedence**
    
- **Group logic** the way **you want**
    
- **Make code more readable and error-free**

In **Part 6**, we’ll apply this knowledge in real coding exercises — you'll try to use parentheses to make expressions equal specific target values like `2` and `0`. Want to proceed?
