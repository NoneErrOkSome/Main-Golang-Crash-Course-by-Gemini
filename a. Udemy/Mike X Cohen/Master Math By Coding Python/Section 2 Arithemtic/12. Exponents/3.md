## 📙 Part 3: Fractional Exponents

### 📐 Definition

A fractional exponent represents a root. For example:

$$ a^{1/2} = \sqrt{a} $$

$$ a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} $$

---

### 🧮 Square Root Examples

$$ 4^{1/2} = 2 \quad \text{because } 2^2 = 4 $$

$$ 9^{1/2} = 3 \quad \text{because } 3^2 = 9 $$

---

### ⚠️ Parentheses Are Crucial in Python

Correct:

```python
4 ** (1/2)    # 2.0
9 ** (1/2)    # 3.0
```

$$ 4^{1/2} = 2,\quad 9^{1/2} = 3 $$

Incorrect:

```python
4 ** 1 / 2    # 2.0 → wrong order: (4^1) / 2
9 ** 1 / 2    # 4.5 → wrong: 9 / 2 = 4.5
```

---

### 🧾 Python Order of Operations

Python evaluates exponents before division:

```python
9 ** 1 / 2  # means (9 ** 1) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5
```

You must wrap fractional powers in parentheses:

```python
9 ** (1 / 2)  # 3.0
```

---

### 🧾 Summary

- Fractional powers like $a^{1/2}$ mean square root.
    
- Always use parentheses in Python: `** (1/2)`
    
- Leaving out parentheses causes incorrect computation due to order of operations.
