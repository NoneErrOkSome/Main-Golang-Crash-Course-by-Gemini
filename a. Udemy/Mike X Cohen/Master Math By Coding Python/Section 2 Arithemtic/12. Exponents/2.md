## 📗 Part 2: Law of Exponents

### 📐 Law: Same Base Multiplication

$$ a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} $$

Example:

$$ 3^2 \cdot 3^4 = 3^{2+4} = 3^6 = 729 $$

---

### 🧮 Python Demonstration

```python
print(3 ** 2 * 3 ** 4)     # 729
print(3 ** (2 + 4))        # 729
```

---

### ⚠️ Use Parentheses When Adding Exponents

Incorrect:

```python
3 ** 2 + 4    # 13 → wrong meaning: (3^2) + 4
```

Correct:

```python
3 ** (2 + 4)  # 729 → correct meaning: 3^(2+4)
```

$$ 3^{2+4} = 3^6 = 729 $$

---

### 🚫 Rule Limitation (Different Bases)

$$ 3^2 \cdot 4^3 \ne \text{simplifiable} $$

Must evaluate both sides independently:

$$ 3^2 = 9,\quad 4^3 = 64,\quad 9 \cdot 64 = 576 $$

```python
print(3 ** 2 * 4 ** 3)     # 576
```

You cannot combine the exponents when the **bases are different**.

---

### 🧾 Summary

- Only combine exponents if the **base is the same**.
    
- Use parentheses when combining exponents with addition.
    
- Do not use this rule across different bases.
