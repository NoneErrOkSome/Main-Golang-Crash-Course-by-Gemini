## 📘 Part 1: Power Basics in Python

### 🔢 Integer Exponents

$$ 3^2 = 9 $$

$$ 3^4 = 81 $$

---

### 🧮 Python Syntax

Use `**` to raise a number to a power.

```python
3 ** 2    # 9
3 ** 4    # 81
```

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistake

Do **not** use `^` for powers in Python.

$$ 3 ^ 2 \ne 3^2 $$

```python
3 ^ 2    # 1  ← Bitwise XOR, not exponentiation
```

---

### 📌 Using Variables

```python
x = 2
3 ** x    # 9

x = 6
3 ** x    # 729
```

$$ 3^2 = 9,\quad 3^6 = 729 $$
