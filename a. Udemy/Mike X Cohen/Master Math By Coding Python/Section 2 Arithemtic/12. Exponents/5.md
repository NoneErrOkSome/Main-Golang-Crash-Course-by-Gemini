## ðŸ“˜ Part 5: Exercise Calculations

### ðŸ§® Given Variables

```python
x = 5
y = 5.1
```

---

### âœ… Expression 1

$$ x^{3/4} \cdot 4^y $$

```python
ans1 = x ** (3/4) * 4 ** y
display(Math("x^{3/4} \\cdot 4^y = %g" % ans1))
```

- Parentheses around `3/4` ensure correct exponentiation.
    
- Result displayed using `display(Math(...))` with LaTeX formatting.
    

---

### âœ… Expression 2

$$ \frac{3^3}{x^y} $$

```python
ans2 = (3 ** 3) / (x ** y)
display(Math("\\frac{3^3}{x^y} = %g" % ans2))
```

- `3^3` is in the numerator, `x^y` in the denominator.
    
- `\\frac{...}{...}` used for LaTeX fraction formatting.
    

---

### âœ… Expression 3

$$ 10^{x - 4} $$

```python
solution = 10 ** (x - 4)
display(Math("10^{x - 4} = %g" % solution))
```

- Expression uses subtraction in the exponent.
    
- Parentheses ensure correct grouping in Python.
    
- Reminder: if $x = 5$, then $x - 4 = 1$, so $10^1 = 10$.
    

---

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

- Use parentheses for fractional or composite exponents.
    
- Use `\\frac` and `^` with `{}` in LaTeX to structure output.
    
- All results displayed with `display(Math(...))` for clean rendering.
