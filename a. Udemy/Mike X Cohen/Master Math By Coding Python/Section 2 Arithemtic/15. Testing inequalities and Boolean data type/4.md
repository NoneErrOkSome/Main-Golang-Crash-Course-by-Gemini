**Part 4: Testing for Equality in Python (`==`) vs Assignment (`=`)**

---

In this part, you’ll learn the difference between:

- `=` (assignment)
    
- `==` (equality test)
    

And you’ll also learn how Python interprets equality checks and how to store the result in a Boolean variable.

---

### ⚠️ `=` is for Assignment

This is used to **set a value** to a variable.

```python
x = 5       # This means "x becomes 5"
```

It does **not** mean “x equals 5” in the math sense. It’s **telling Python to store** the value `5` into the variable `x`.

---

### ✅ `==` is for Equality Comparison

This is used to **compare** two values to see if they are the **same**.

```python
print(4 == 2 + 2)
```

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

Here, Python evaluates the right-hand side:

- $2 + 2 = 4$
    
- Then it checks: $4 == 4$ → `True`
    

---

### ❌ Mistake: Using `=` Instead of `==`

If you try:

```python
print(4 = 2 + 2)
```

You’ll get an error:

```python
SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
```

Because `=` is only used for variable assignment — not comparison — and `4` is not a variable.

---

### 🧪 Storing an Equality Check

Let’s store the result of a test in a variable:

```python
the_test = 4 == 2 + 2
print(the_test)
```

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

This line has **both kinds of equals signs**:

- `=` is for **assignment** (store the result into `the_test`)
    
- `==` is for **equality check** (is 4 equal to 2 + 2?)
    

---

### 🧠 Confirm the Data Type

Just like in previous parts, let’s confirm that the result is a **Boolean**:

```python
print(type(the_test))
```

🖨️ Output:

```python
<class 'bool'>
```

This confirms that the variable holds a **Boolean** value — either `True` or `False`.

### 🧾 Summary: `=` vs `==`

|Symbol|Purpose|Example|Reads As|
|---|---|---|---|
|`=`|Assignment|`x = 5`|x becomes 5|
|`==`|Equality test|`x == 5`|Is x equal to 5?|

---

### ✅ More Examples

```python
print(7 == 7)         # True
print(3 + 4 == 8)     # False
print("hello" == "hi")# False
print("yes" == "yes")# True
```

Python can compare **numbers**, **strings**, and **expressions**.

### 🔎 Summary Table of Key Concepts So Far

|Concept|Python Code Example|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Greater Than|`10 > 8`|`True`|
|Less Than|`10 < 8`|`False`|
|Greater/Equal|`4 >= 4`|`True`|
|Less/Equal|`5 <= 4`|`False`|
|Equal To|`4 == 2 + 2`|`True`|
|Assign Value|`x = 4`|No output (stores value)|

In **Part 5**, you’ll apply all this by solving **compound inequality exercises** using variable values and evaluating which conditions return `True`. Ready to continue?
