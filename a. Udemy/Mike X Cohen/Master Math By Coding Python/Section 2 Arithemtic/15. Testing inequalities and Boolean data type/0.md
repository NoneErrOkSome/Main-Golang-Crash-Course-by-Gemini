This video can be thoroughly covered in **6 parts**. Here's how I would break it down:

---

### **ğŸ“˜ Part 1: Introduction to Inequalities and Boolean Logic**

- What are inequalities: >, <, â‰¥, â‰¤
    
- Boolean data type: `True` and `False`
    
- Comparison to numeric values (1 and 0)
    
- Python always prints full words: `True`, `False`
    

---

### **ğŸ“˜ Part 2: Implementing Basic Inequalities in Python**

- Using `>` and `<`
    
- Demonstrating comparisons with numbers
    
- Assigning boolean result to a variable
    
- Printing the variable
    
- Checking variable type with `type(...)` function
    

---

### **ğŸ“˜ Part 3: Greater Than or Equal / Less Than or Equal**

- Using `>=` and `<=`
    
- Examples with arithmetic on one side
    
- Demonstrating how precision matters
    
- Show expressions that toggle between `True` and `False`
    

---

### **ğŸ“˜ Part 4: Testing for Equality**

- `=` is assignment, not comparison
    
- `==` is the equality test
    
- How `==` fits into expressions
    
- Assigning results of equality tests to variables
    
- Example: `theTest = 4 == 2 + 2`
    

---

### **ğŸ“˜ Part 5: Application Exercise Setup**

- Displaying exercise:
    
    - Two inequalities
        
    - Three values of `x`: 2, 3, 4
        
- Explain what needs to be done:
    
    - Evaluate both inequalities for each `x`
        
    - Figure out which values make them `True`
        

---

### **ğŸ“˜ Part 6: Solving the Exercises in Python**

- Implement both inequalities
    
- Use `x = 2`, `x = 3`, `x = 4` one at a time
    
- Print results of each test
    
- Identify for which `x` each inequality is `True`
    
- Conclude:
    
    - First inequality is true only for `x = 2`
        
    - Second is true for all 3 values
