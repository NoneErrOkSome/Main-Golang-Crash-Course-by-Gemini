**Part 3: Using `>=`, `<=`, and Understanding Boolean Output in Python**

---

In this part, you’ll learn how to test for **inclusive inequalities** — where a value can be greater **or equal**, or less **or equal** — and see how Python handles this just like basic comparisons.

You’ll also see how small changes in numbers can flip a Boolean result from `True` to `False`.

### 🔢 1. Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)

This checks whether the value on the left is either **greater than** OR **equal to** the value on the right.

#### Example:

```python
print(4 >= 2 + 2)
```

➡️ $2 + 2 = 4$, and $4 \geq 4$ is **true**.

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

Try changing the right-hand side:

```python
print(4 >= 2 + 3)
```

➡️ $2 + 3 = 5$, and $4 \geq 5$ is **false**.

🖨️ Output:

```python
False
```

---

### 🔢 2. Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)

This checks whether the left-hand value is **less than** OR **equal to** the right-hand value.

#### Example:

```python
print(4 <= 3 + 1)
```

➡️ $3 + 1 = 4$, and $4 \leq 4$ → `True`

---

### 🧪 3. Using Variables and Arithmetic in Conditions

Just like earlier, you can mix in **variables and expressions**.

#### Example:

```python
b = 4 <= 3 + 2
print(b)
```

➡️ $3 + 2 = 5$, and $4 \leq 5$ → `True`

### 🧠 4. Precision Can Flip Booleans

Here’s a neat example:

```python
value = 3.333 * 3
print(value)
```

🖨️ Output (approximate):

```python
9.999
```

Then:

```python
print(10 > value)   # True
print(10 < value)   # False
```

Now, increase precision slightly:

```python
value = 3.3334 * 3
```

🖨️ Output:

```python
10.0002
```

And test again:

```python
print(10 > value)  # False
print(10 < value)  # True
```

⚠️ Even small changes can flip the **truth value** of an expression. This is crucial when working with decimals.

### 📌 Summary of Symbols and Meanings

|Symbol|Meaning|Example|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|`>`|Greater than|`4 > 3`|`True`|
|`<`|Less than|`4 < 5`|`True`|
|`>=`|Greater than or equal to|`4 >= 4`|`True`|
|`<=`|Less than or equal to|`4 <= 5`|`True`|

---

### ✅ Quick Boolean Test Table

Let’s test $4$ against different expressions:

|Expression|Result|
|---|---|
|`4 > 5`|`False`|
|`4 >= 4`|`True`|
|`4 < 5`|`True`|
|`4 <= 3`|`False`|
|`4 <= 4`|`True`|

In **Part 4**, you’ll learn how to test for **equality** (`==`) and why you **must not** confuse it with assignment (`=`). Want to continue?
