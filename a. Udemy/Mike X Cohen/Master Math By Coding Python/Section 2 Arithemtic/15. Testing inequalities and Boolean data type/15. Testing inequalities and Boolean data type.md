## 🧮 **Topic: Inequalities & Boolean Data Type in Python**

---

### 🟡 **Inequalities Refresher**

1. **What is an inequality?**
    
    - An inequality compares two values using relational operators.
        
    - Similar to equals `=`, but open-ended and used for comparisons.
        
2. **Basic inequality symbols:**
    
    - `>` : Greater than (e.g., `4 > 3`)
        
    - `<` : Less than (e.g., `4 < 5`)
        
    - `>=` : Greater than or equal to (e.g., `4 >= 2 + 2`)
        
    - `<=` : Less than or equal to (e.g., `4 <= 3 + 2`)

### 🟩 **Boolean Data Type (also called logical)**

3. **Only two possible values:**
    
    - `True`
        
    - `False`
        
    - Used to represent binary conditions.
        
4. **Representation across languages:**
    
    - Sometimes shown as `1` (true) and `0` (false)
        
    - Python always displays `True` or `False`
        
5. **Example of Boolean in Python:**
    
    ```python
    4 > 5  # False
    4 < 5  # True
    ```

### 🧪 **Setting Boolean Expressions to Variables**

6. **Arithmetic inside expressions:**
    
    ```python
    b = 10 > 3 * 3  # True
    print(b)        # Output: True
    ```
    
7. **Check variable type:**
    
    ```python
    print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
    ```
    
8. **Edge-case precision:**
    
    - `3 * 3.333` is very close to `10`
        
    - Adding decimals may push it above or below `10`, affecting the result

### 🟥 **Greater than or equal to / Less than or equal to**

9. **Examples:**
    
    ```python
    4 >= 2 + 2  # True
    4 >= 2 + 2 + 1  # False
    4 <= 5  # True
    ```
    

---

### ⚠️ **Testing for Equality**

10. **Avoid this (assignment):**
    

```python
4 = 2 + 2  # ❌ SyntaxError
```

11. **Use `==` for comparison:**
    

```python
4 == 2 + 2  # ✅ True
```

12. **Store equality check result:**
    

```python
theTest = 4 == 2 + 2
print(theTest)  # True
```

13. **Explanation:**
    

- `=` assigns values.
    
- `==` compares for equality.

### 🧑‍🏫 **Exercise Overview**

14. **Expressions to test:**
    

- `4x + 3 < 17 - x²`
    
- `8x - 2 <= -3x + 42`
    

15. **Test these values of x:**
    

- `x = 2`
    
- `x = 3`
    
- `x = 4`
    

16. **Simple example for clarity:**
    

```python
x = 0
4*x + 3 < 17 - x**2  # 3 < 17 → True
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Python Implementation of the Exercise**

17. **Declare x values:**
    

```python
x = 2  # Then test x = 3 and x = 4 by reassigning
```

18. **First inequality in Python:**
    

```python
print(4*x + 3 < 17 - x**2)
```

19. **Result:**
    

- `x = 2` → `True`
    
- `x = 3` → `False`
    
- `x = 4` → `False`
    

20. **Second inequality in Python:**
    

```python
print(8*x - 2 <= -3*x + 42)
```

21. **Result:**
    

- `x = 2` → `True`
    
- `x = 3` → `True`
    
- `x = 4` → `True`
