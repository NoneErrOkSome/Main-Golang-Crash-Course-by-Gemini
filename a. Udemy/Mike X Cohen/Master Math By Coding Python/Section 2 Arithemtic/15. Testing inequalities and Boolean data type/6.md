**Part 6: Final Concepts – Boolean Logic and Preparing for `if` Statements**

---

Now that you’ve mastered comparing numbers using Python's **inequality operators** and storing the results in **Boolean variables**, it’s time to wrap up this lesson with a quick recap — and preview what’s coming next.

Let’s go over the final ideas you learned in this section before moving on to decision-making with `if`.

### 🧠 Recap: What Are Boolean Values?

A **Boolean** is a data type that holds just **two** possible values:

- `True`
    
- `False`
    

These values result from evaluating conditions like:

```python
x > 5
x <= 3
x == 7
```

Each of these produces a **Boolean** result.

### ✅ All the Operators You’ve Learned

|Symbol|Meaning|Example|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|`>`|Greater than|`5 > 3`|`True`|
|`<`|Less than|`2 < 1`|`False`|
|`>=`|Greater than or equal to|`3 >= 3`|`True`|
|`<=`|Less than or equal to|`4 <= 3`|`False`|
|`==`|Equal to|`2 == 2`|`True`|
|`!=`|Not equal to|`3 != 4`|`True`|

> Note: `!=` means “not equal to.” You’ll use this often with conditionals.

### 📦 You Also Learned

- How to store a comparison in a variable:
    

```python
check = x < 10
print(check)
```

- How to confirm the type:
    

```python
print(type(check))    # <class 'bool'>
```

- That `=` is used for **assignment**, and `==` is used for **equality checking**
    

---

### 🧪 Practical Example

```python
x = 6
print(x > 5)      # True
print(x < 3)      # False
print(x == 6)     # True
print(x != 6)     # False
```

These expressions are useful when you want your program to make **decisions**. That’s what comes next.

### 🚀 Coming Up Next: `if` Statements

Boolean logic becomes powerful when you **combine** it with conditional control structures.

In the next lesson, you'll learn:

- How to use `if` statements to **make decisions** in your program
    
- How to trigger certain lines of code **only when** something is `True`
    
- How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to build full logic chains

### 🔚 Final Thought

You're now ready to move beyond comparisons and start using logic to **control your code**.

> In short:  
> Booleans tell you **yes or no**,  
> and `if` lets your code **respond accordingly**.
