**Part 2: Implementing Basic Inequalities in Python**

---

Now that you understand the **concept of inequalities and booleans**, let‚Äôs see how they work in actual **Python code**. We‚Äôll test inequalities like $4 > 5$ and store the results as variables.

---

### üß™ 1. Basic Greater Than and Less Than

In Python:

- Use `>` for "greater than"
    
- Use `<` for "less than"
    

#### Example:

```python
print(4 > 5)     # Is 4 greater than 5?
```

üñ®Ô∏è Output:

```python
False
```

That makes sense ‚Äî $4 > 5$ is not true.

Try:

```python
print(4 < 5)
```

üñ®Ô∏è Output:

```python
True
```

### üîß 2. Assigning Inequality Result to a Variable

You can store the **boolean result** in a variable.

```python
b = 10 > 3 * 3
```

- $3 \times 3 = 9$
    
- $10 > 9$ ‚Üí `True`
    
- So `b` stores `True`
    

To check:

```python
print(b)       # Output: True
```

‚úÖ This variable `b` now holds the **truth value** of that statement.

---

### üß† 3. What Type of Data Is This?

To check the **data type** of a variable in Python, use:

```python
print(type(b))
```

üñ®Ô∏è Output:

```python
<class 'bool'>
```

This confirms `b` is a boolean (not a string like `"True"` or `"False"`).

---

### üßÆ 4. Boolean Values Aren‚Äôt Strings or Numbers

This is important:

```python
True != "True"      # Not the same as a string
True != 1           # Even though it's treated like 1 in some places
```

In Python:

- `True` is a **Boolean**
    
- `"True"` is a **string**
    
- `1` is an **integer**
    

They **look similar**, but Python treats them **very differently**.

---

### üß™ 5. Changing Conditions for `False`

Let‚Äôs test a condition that becomes false:

```python
b = 10 > 3.3334 * 3
```

Here:

- $3.3334 \times 3 = 10.0002$
    
- So $10 > 10.0002$ ‚Üí `False`
    

```python
print(b)       # Output: False
```

### üßæ Recap of What You Learned

|Concept|Python Syntax|Example|Output|
|---|---|---|---|
|Greater Than|`>`|`4 > 5`|`False`|
|Less Than|`<`|`4 < 5`|`True`|
|Assign Boolean to Variable|`=`|`b = 10 > 9`|`b = True`|
|Check Data Type|`type(...)`|`type(b)`|`<class 'bool'>`|

In **Part 3**, you‚Äôll learn how to use the remaining inequality symbols like **greater than or equal to** and **less than or equal to**, plus how to make conditions flip between `True` and `False`. Want to move on?
