**Part 5: Solving Inequality Exercises with Boolean Logic in Python**

---

In this part, you’ll practice everything you've learned so far by:

1. Implementing **inequalities** in Python
    
2. Testing multiple values of **x**
    
3. Using **Boolean logic** to check which values make an inequality **True**
    

---

### 🎯 The Challenge

You're given two expressions (inequalities) and a set of 3 possible values for $x$.

#### Expressions:

1. $4x + 3 < 17 - x^2$
    
2. $8x - 2 \leq -3x + 42$
    

#### Candidate Values:

- $x = 2$
    
- $x = 3$
    
- $x = 4$
    

Your goal is to **check which values of x make each inequality True.**

---

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Setup

Let’s walk through it in Python:

#### 1. Try $x = 2$ for the First Inequality

```python
x = 2
print(4 * x + 3 < 17 - x ** 2)
```

🧠 Compute:

- LHS: $4 \cdot 2 + 3 = 11$
    
- RHS: $17 - 2^2 = 13$
    
- Is $11 < 13$? ✅ Yes → `True`
    

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

---

#### 2. Try $x = 3$

```python
x = 3
print(4 * x + 3 < 17 - x ** 2)
```

🧠 Compute:

- LHS: $4 \cdot 3 + 3 = 15$
    
- RHS: $17 - 9 = 8$
    
- $15 < 8$? ❌ No → `False`
    

🖨️ Output:

```python
False
```

---

#### 3. Try $x = 4$

```python
x = 4
print(4 * x + 3 < 17 - x ** 2)
```

🧠 Compute:

- LHS: $4 \cdot 4 + 3 = 19$
    
- RHS: $17 - 16 = 1$
    
- $19 < 1$? ❌ No → `False`
    

🖨️ Output:

```python
False`
```

✅ Final Verdict for Inequality #1:  
Only $x = 2$ makes the inequality **True**.

---

### 🔁 Now Do the Same for Inequality #2

#### Expression:

$$ 8x - 2 \leq -3x + 42 $$

Try all 3 values of $x$ again.

---

#### $x = 2$

```python
x = 2
print(8 * x - 2 <= -3 * x + 42)
```

🧠 Compute:

- LHS: $16 - 2 = 14$
    
- RHS: −6+42=36-6 + 42 = 36
    
- $14 \leq 36$ ✅ True
    

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

---

#### $x = 3$

```python
x = 3
print(8 * x - 2 <= -3 * x + 42)
```

🧠 Compute:

- LHS: $24 - 2 = 22$
    
- RHS: −9+42=33-9 + 42 = 33
    
- $22 \leq 33$ ✅ True
    

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

---

#### $x = 4$

```python
x = 4
print(8 * x - 2 <= -3 * x + 42)
```

🧠 Compute:

- LHS: $32 - 2 = 30$
    
- RHS: −12+42=30-12 + 42 = 30
    
- $30 \leq 30$ ✅ True
    

🖨️ Output:

```python
True
```

✅ Final Verdict for Inequality #2:  
All 3 values of $x = 2, 3, 4$ make the inequality **True**.

### 🧾 Summary Table

|Expression|x = 2|x = 3|x = 4|
|---|---|---|---|
|$4x + 3 < 17 - x^2$|✅|❌|❌|
|$8x - 2 \leq -3x + 42$|✅|✅|✅|
