**Part 1: Introduction to Inequalities and Boolean Logic**

### 🧮 What Are Inequalities?

In math, **inequalities** are like equations, but instead of checking if two values are equal, we check if one is **bigger or smaller** than the other.

Here are the most common **inequality symbols**:

- $>$ → **greater than**  
    Example: $4 > 3$ means "4 is greater than 3"
    
- $<$ → **less than**  
    Example: $4 < 5$ means "4 is less than 5"
    
- $\geq$ → **greater than or equal to**  
    Example: $4 \geq 4$ is **true**
    
- $\leq$ → **less than or equal to**  
    Example: $4 \leq 5$ is **true**
    

These are **used to compare two values** and get a result of either **True** or **False**.

### 💡 Example Inequalities in Words

|Expression|Reads As|True or False?|
|---|---|---|
|$4 > 3$|4 is greater than 3|✅ True|
|$4 < 5$|4 is less than 5|✅ True|
|$4 \geq 2 + 2$|4 is greater than or equal to 4|✅ True|
|$4 \leq 3 + 2$|4 is less than or equal to 5|✅ True|

### 🧠 What is a Boolean?

A **boolean** (or **logical**) is a **data type** that can only be:

- `True`
    
- `False`
    

This is used in programming **to make decisions**.

**Examples:**

- Is 5 greater than 2? → `True`
    
- Is 7 equal to 10? → `False`
    

Think of it as a yes-or-no switch:

- ✅ Yes → `True`
    
- ❌ No → `False`

### 🧮 Booleans vs Numbers

Some languages (not Python) treat `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`.

But in **Python**, it shows you:

```python
True
False
```

⚠️ These are **not** strings or numbers. They are a **special data type** used for logic.

### 🧾 Summary

- **Inequalities** test whether numbers are larger or smaller than each other.
    
- A **boolean** is the answer to a question like "Is 4 > 3?" → `True`
    
- Python always returns either `True` or `False` when testing inequalities.
    
- These values are **not strings** — they are their own type: **`bool`**

In **Part 2**, you’ll see how to actually write and test inequalities in **Python code** and assign the result to a variable. Ready to move on?
