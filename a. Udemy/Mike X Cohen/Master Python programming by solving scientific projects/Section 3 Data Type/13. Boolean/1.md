### üîç **Deep Dive: Part 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Booleans**

#### ‚úÖ What is a Boolean?

A **Boolean** is a data type that has only two possible values:

- $\text{True}$
    
- $\text{False}$
    

These values are used to represent binary logic: yes/no, on/off, 1/0, etc.

In Python, the Boolean type is spelled with an uppercase first letter: $\textbf{True}$ and $\textbf{False}$. These are **keywords**, not strings.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake

People often confuse the Boolean keyword `True` with the string `"True"`:

```python
bool_true = True      # Boolean type
str_true = "True"     # String type
```

They look similar, but:

- `True` (no quotes) is a **Boolean**
    
- `"True"` (with quotes) is a **string**
    

You can verify their types with `type()`:

```python
print(type(True))      # <class 'bool'>
print(type("True"))    # <class 'str'>
```

#### üìå Binary Concept

Booleans are binary ‚Äî they can only be:

- $\text{True}$
    
- $\text{False}$
    

There are **no other values** possible in a Boolean context.

#### üß† Summary

|Concept|Value|Type|
|---|---|---|
|`True`|Boolean true|`bool`|
|`False`|Boolean false|`bool`|
|`"True"`|String `"True"`|`str`|
|`"False"`|String `"False"`|`str`|
