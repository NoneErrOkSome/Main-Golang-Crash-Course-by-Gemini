### 🔍 **Deep Dive: Part 3 – Using Booleans in Variables**

#### 🧪 Assigning Comparison Results

You can **store** the result of a comparison (a Boolean value) in a variable. This makes the Boolean reusable in later code.

Example:

```python
a = 8
b = 4
outcome = a == b * 2
print(outcome)
```

Step-by-step:

- $b = 4$
    
- $b \times 2 = 8$
    
- $a = 8$
    
- So $a == b \times 2$ becomes:
    
    $$8 == 8 → \text{True}$$
    

Thus:

```python
outcome = True
```

And:

```python
print(outcome)   # prints True
```

#### ⚠️ Watch the Equal Signs

This line may look confusing:

```python
outcome = a == b * 2
```

There are **three things** happening:

1. `a == b * 2` → comparison → returns a Boolean
    
2. The result is either `True` or `False`
    
3. `outcome = ...` → assignment of that Boolean into the variable
    

So in symbolic logic:

$$\text{outcome} = (a == b \times 2)$$

#### 🧪 Change the Comparison

If we do:

```python
a = 8
b = 5
outcome = a == b * 2   # b * 2 = 10
```

Now:

$$8 == 10 → \text{False}$$

So:

```python
outcome = False
```

#### 🧠 Summary

- You can **assign** Boolean expressions to variables.
    
- That assignment captures the **result** (`True` or `False`).
    
- This allows for better organization and reuse in logic-heavy programs.
