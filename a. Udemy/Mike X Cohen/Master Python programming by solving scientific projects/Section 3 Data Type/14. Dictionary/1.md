### 🔍 **Deep Dive: Part 1 – Introduction to Dictionaries**

#### 📘 What is a Dictionary?

A **dictionary** in Python is a built-in data structure used to store **key-value pairs**. It acts like a real dictionary:

- The **key** is like the word you look up.
    
- The **value** is the definition or associated data.
    

In mathematical notation, think of a dictionary as a function:

$$f(\text{key}) = \text{value}$$

#### 🧠 Characteristics of a Dictionary

- **Unordered**: Items are not stored in a fixed order.
    
- **Mutable**: You can change, add, or remove items after creation.
    
- **Key-Value Mapping**: Each key maps to one value.

#### ✅ Creating an Empty Dictionary

There are two ways to initialize an empty dictionary:

```python
D = dict()
```

or

```python
D = {}
```

Both result in:

$$D = {} \quad \text{(an empty dictionary)}$$

#### 🔢 Comparison to Other Brackets

Different brackets mean different things in Python:

|Bracket|Usage|
|---|---|
|`()`|Function calls, tuples|
|`[]`|Lists, indexing, slicing|
|`{}`|Dictionaries, sets|

So when you see **curly braces**, think **dictionary** (or set, depending on the context).

#### 📚 Dictionary vs MATLAB Structure

If you're coming from MATLAB:

- MATLAB’s `struct` is similar to Python’s `dict`.
    
- Example in MATLAB:
    
    ```matlab
    person.name = 'Mike';
    person.age = 34;
    ```
    
- Equivalent in Python:
    
    ```python
    person = {
        "name": "Mike",
        "age": 34
    }
    ```

#### 🧪 Summary

|Concept|Example|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Empty dictionary|`D = dict()` or `D = {}`|$${}$$|
|Curly braces|`D = {"key": "value"}`|$${\text{"key": "value"}}$$|
|Dictionary type|`type(D)`|`<class 'dict'>`|
