### 🔍 **Deep Dive: Part 5 – Dictionary Use Case: Exercise Walkthrough**

---

#### 🧪 Goal of the Exercise

You're going to:

1. Prompt the user to input **two numbers**
    
2. Convert them to numeric values
    
3. Store them in a dictionary with the following keys:
    
    - `"first_number"`
        
    - `"second_number"`
        
    - `"product"`
        
4. Output the dictionary to confirm it worked

#### 🧹 Step 1: Clear Previous Dictionary

If you already used the variable `D`, you can delete it using:

```python
del D
```

Now trying to access `D` will give:

```python
NameError: name 'D' is not defined
```

This ensures your new dictionary won't conflict with old values.

#### 🔢 Step 2: Get User Input and Convert

Prompt the user to input numbers:

```python
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
```

Why `float()` instead of `int()`?

- Safer for general-purpose numbers
    
- Accepts decimals like 5.5 or 6.0
    

---

#### 🧱 Step 3: Create the Dictionary

Create the dictionary with three key-value pairs:

```python
D = {}
D["first_number"] = num1
D["second_number"] = num2
D["product"] = num1 * num2
```

Only the last line involves math:

$$\text{product} = \text{num1} \times \text{num2}$$

Example: If `num1 = 6` and `num2 = 5`, then:

$$6 \times 5 = 30$$

---

#### 📤 Step 4: Display the Dictionary

You can print the dictionary:

```python
print(D)
```

Or use `.items()` for a cleaner display:

```python
print(D.items())
```

Output:

```python
dict_items([
  ('first_number', 6.0),
  ('second_number', 5.0),
  ('product', 30.0)
])
```

#### 🧠 Best Practices and Warnings

- ⚠️ Avoid careless copy-pasting. Always rename both variables and prompts correctly.
    
- ✅ Use clear test numbers like `6` and `5` so you can confirm the product mentally.
    
- 🧪 Use `print()` or `.items()` often during development to inspect what's inside your dictionary.
