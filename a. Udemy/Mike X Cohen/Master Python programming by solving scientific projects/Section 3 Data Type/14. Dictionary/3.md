#### ‚úèÔ∏è Two Ways to Create a Dictionary

**1. Step-by-step assignment:**

```python
D = {}
D["name"] = "Mike"
D["age_range"] = "20-50"
```

- You start with an empty dictionary: $$D = {}$$
    
- Then add key-value pairs one at a time.
    

**2. Literal (inline) definition:**

```python
E = {
  "name": "Mike",
  "age_range": "20-50"
}
```

- Same result as method 1, but written all at once.
    
- Internally equivalent:
    

$$ E = { \text{"name"} : \text{"Mike"},\ \text{"age_range"} : \text{"20-50"} } $$

#### üóù Accessing Values by Keys

To retrieve a value:

```python
D["name"]
```

Returns:

$$\text{"Mike"}$$

Think of it like function notation:

$$D[\text{"name"}] = \text{"Mike"}$$

---

#### ‚ùå Accessing a Missing Key

If the key doesn‚Äôt exist:

```python
D["email"]
```

You get:

```text
KeyError: 'email'
```

So you must ensure the key exists before accessing it (or use `.get()` which we‚Äôll cover later).

#### ‚ùó Dictionaries Are Not Ordered (Before Python 3.7)

The insertion order of keys is **not guaranteed** in older versions of Python.

For example:

```python
D = {
  "name": "Mike",
  "age_range": "20-50"
}
```

Might internally be:

```python
{'age_range': '20-50', 'name': 'Mike'}
```

This means:

$$D[0] \text{ is invalid} \quad \text{(no positional access)}$$

Dictionaries do **not** support indexing like lists:

```python
my_list[0]    # valid
D[0]          # KeyError
```

#### üß† Summary

|Operation|Syntax|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Create empty dict|`D = {}`|$${}$$|
|Add entry|`D["x"] = 5`|$$D = {"x": 5}$$|
|Inline creation|`D = {"x": 5}`|same as above|
|Get value by key|`D["x"]`|$$5$$|
|Invalid index access|`D[0]`|`KeyError`|
