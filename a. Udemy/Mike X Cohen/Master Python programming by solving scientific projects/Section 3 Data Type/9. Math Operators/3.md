Great! Here's the **detailed expansion of Part 3: Basic Arithmetic â€“ Addition & Subtraction**, fully scoped to the transcript.

## âž•âž– **Part 3: Basic Arithmetic â€“ Addition & Subtraction**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Perform **basic math** using variables in Python
    
- Understand how **expressions** are evaluated
    
- Assign the result of a calculation to a **new variable**
    
- Use `print()` to view numeric results clearly
    

---

## ðŸ§ª **Step 1: Subtraction Using Variables**

Letâ€™s begin with a subtraction example from the transcript:

```python
x = 7
print(x - 6)
```

âœ… Output:

```
1
```

> Here, Python evaluates the **expression** `x - 6`, which is `7 - 6 = 1`, and prints the result.

---

## ðŸ§® **Step 2: Creating an Expression Variable**

Now letâ€™s store the result of a math expression into a **new variable**:

```python
y = 4.1
c = x + y - 2
print(c)
```

âœ… Output:

```
9.1
```

Letâ€™s break it down:

- `x = 7`
    
- `y = 4.1`
    
- `x + y = 11.1`
    
- `11.1 - 2 = 9.1`
    

> Python calculates the full expression from **left to right** using standard **math order** (PEMDAS applies when needed).

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Idea: You Can Use Variables in Math**

Just like using numbers directly, you can:

- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide using **variables**
    
- Combine multiple variables and constants in one line
    

Example:

```python
result = x + y + 10 - 3
```

## ðŸ“¦ **Math Operators Recap**

|Symbol|Operation|Example|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|`+`|Addition|`5 + 2`|`7`|
|`-`|Subtraction|`5 - 2`|`3`|

---

## ðŸ§± Best Practice with `print()`

You should **always use `print()`** when working with multiple cells, like so:

```python
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c)
```

This ensures you get clean output, especially when working in Jupyter cells where only the **last line** without `print()` would show output.

---

## âœ… Summary

|Concept|Example|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Subtract a number from variable|`print(x - 6)`|`1`|
|Store expression in variable|`c = x + y - 2`|`9.1`|
|Use `print()` for output|`print(c)`|Clean display|
|Combine variables and numbers|`x + y - 2 + 10`|Expression works as expected|
