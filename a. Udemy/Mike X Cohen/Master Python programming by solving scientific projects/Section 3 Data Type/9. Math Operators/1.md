Absolutely! Here's a **deep dive expansion of Part 1: Numeric Variables & Types**, following the **scope and details** of the transcript.

## 🧮🔢 **Part 1: Numeric Variables & Types**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Create numeric variables in Python
    
- Understand the difference between `int` (integer) and `float` (floating point)
    
- Learn how Python handles numbers with or without a decimal point
    
- Compare values and types explicitly
    

---

## 📦 **Step 1: Create Numeric Variables**

The transcript introduces three variables:

```python
x = 7
y = 4.1
z = 0
```

Here’s what each variable is:

- `x` → whole number → **int**
    
- `y` → decimal number → **float**
    
- `z` → also a whole number → **int**
    

---

## 🔍 **Step 2: View the Variables with `%whos`**

Use this **magic command** to inspect all current variables:

```python
%whos
```

Example output:

```
Variable   Type     Data/Info
-----------------------------
x          int      7
y          float    4.1
z          int      0
```

This confirms:

- `x` is an `int`
    
- `y` is a `float` (decimal)
    
- `z` is also an `int`
    

---

## 🎯 **Step 3: Understanding `int` vs `float`**

### ✅ What’s an `int`?

- Short for **integer**
    
- A whole number
    
- No decimal point
    

Examples:

```python
x = 5
age = 32
```

### ✅ What’s a `float`?

- Short for **floating point number**
    
- Has a **decimal point**
    
- Can represent fractions, even if they're `.0`
    

Examples:

```python
pi = 3.14
weight = 60.0
```

### 🧠 **Key Insight: `4.0 ≠ 4` in Python**

They might look the same to a human, but **Python treats them differently**:

```python
print(type(4))     # <class 'int'>
print(type(4.0))   # <class 'float'>
```

Even though `4 == 4.0` returns `True`, they are **different types**:

- `4` → `int`
    
- `4.0` → `float`
    

---

## 🔍 **Step 4: Show Values for Visual Comparison**

Try this:

```python
print(y)  # 4.1 (float)
print(z)  # 0   (int)
```

You can also see them side-by-side:

```python
print(y, z)
```

Result:

```
4.1 0
```

Use `%whos` again to confirm:

```python
%whos
```

## 🧱 **Summary Table**

|Variable|Value|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`x`|`7`|`int`|Whole number|
|`y`|`4.1`|`float`|Decimal number|
|`z`|`0`|`int`|Integer zero|
|`4.0`|`4.0`|`float`|Not equal in type to `4`|

---

## 💡 Concept Reinforcement

Python’s typing system is **strong and dynamic**:

- **Strong**: Doesn’t automatically convert between types
    
- **Dynamic**: You don’t have to declare types — Python infers them at runtime
    

So even though you **didn’t write** `float y = 4.1`, Python still knows it's a float.
