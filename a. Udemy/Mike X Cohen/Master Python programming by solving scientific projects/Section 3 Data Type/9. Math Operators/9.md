## ‚ûïüîÅ **Part 9: Operator Overloading**

### üéØ **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Understand the concept of **operator overloading**
    
- See how the **same operator** (`+`, `*`) behaves **differently** depending on the **data type**
    
- Learn through examples using both numbers and strings

## üß† **What Is Operator Overloading?**

> Operator overloading means that **the same symbol** (like `+`) performs **different operations** depending on the **types of values** it's used with.

---

## ‚ûï **Example 1: `+` with Numbers**

```python
a = 3
b = 4
print(a + b)
```

$$ 3 + 4 = 7 $$

Here, `+` performs **arithmetic addition**.

---

## ‚ûï **Example 2: `+` with Strings**

```python
first = "Mike"
last = "Cohen"
print(first + " " + last)
```

Result:

```
Mike Cohen
```

Here, `+` performs **string concatenation** ‚Äî it joins the strings together.

---

## ‚úñÔ∏è **Example 3: `*` with Numbers**

```python
print(3 * 4)
```

$$ 3 \times 4 = 12 $$

This is **numeric multiplication**.

---

## ‚úñÔ∏è **Example 4: `*` with Strings**

```python
print("Hi" * 3)
```

Result:

```
HiHiHi
```

Here, `*` means **repetition** ‚Äî the string `"Hi"` is repeated **3 times**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Happens If You Use `-` or `/` on Strings?**

These operators are **not overloaded for strings**. Trying them results in an error:

```python
"Mike" - "Cohen"    # ‚ùå Error
"Mike" / 2          # ‚ùå Error
```

Error message:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)
```

## üß© Summary Table of Overloaded Operators

|Operator|Data Type|Operation Type|Example|Result|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`+`|Numbers|Arithmetic Addition|$3 + 4 = 7$|`7`|
|`+`|Strings|Concatenation|`"A" + "B"`|`"AB"`|
|`*`|Numbers|Multiplication|$3 \times 4 = 12$|`12`|
|`*`|String & Int|Repetition|`"Hi" * 3`|`"HiHiHi"`|
|`-`, `/`|Strings|‚ùå Not Overloaded|`"A" - "B"`|‚ùå Error|

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Python lets operators behave differently depending on the **data type**.
    
- This is called **operator overloading**.
    
- `+` and `*` are overloaded for both numbers and strings.
    
- `-` and `/` work only for numbers ‚Äî **not** for strings.
