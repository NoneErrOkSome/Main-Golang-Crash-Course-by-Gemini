## 🔁🧵 **Part 11: Repetition with Strings (Using `*`)**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Understand how the `*` operator works when used with **strings**
    
- Explore how **repetition** differs from multiplication
    
- Reinforce the concept of **operator overloading**
    
- Test different combinations of strings and integers

## ✖️ **1. Multiplying Strings by Integers**

Python allows you to multiply a string by an integer.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
first_name = "Mike"
print(first_name * 4)
```

✅ Output:

```
MikeMikeMikeMike
```

> This does **not** mean multiplication in the numeric sense.  
> It means: **repeat the string** 4 times.

## 💡 **Operator Overloading Reminder**

When using `*`:

- With numbers: it performs **multiplication**
    
- With a string and an integer: it performs **repetition**
    

### Math Comparison:

$$ 3 \times 4 = 12 $$

But for strings:

$$ \text{"Mike"} \times 4 = \text{"MikeMikeMikeMike"} $$

## 🔀 **Repetition Is One-Way**

Valid:

```python
"Hi" * 3     # → HiHiHi
3 * "Hi"     # → HiHiHi
```

But this will cause an error:

```python
"Hi" * "3"   # ❌ TypeError
```

> You **must multiply a string by an integer**, not another string.

---

## 🧪 **More Examples**

```python
print("Go!" * 2)
# Output: Go!Go!

print("A" * 5)
# Output: AAAAA

print(2 * "Yes ")
# Output: Yes Yes 
```

This works **both ways** as long as one side is an integer and the other is a string.

## 🧱 Summary Table

|Expression|Result|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`"Hi" * 3`|`"HiHiHi"`|Repeat 3 times|
|`3 * "Hi"`|`"HiHiHi"`|Also valid|
|`"Hi" * "3"`|❌ Error|Can't multiply str by str|
|`"Go!" * 0`|`""` (empty string)|Repeats 0 times|
|`"Hello" * -1`|`""` (empty string)|Negative count = empty string|

---

## 🔁 Visual Recap (String vs Math)

|Operation Type|Example|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Numeric|$3 \times 4 = 12$|Multiply values|
|String repeat|`"Ha" * 3`|`"HaHaHa"`|
|Mixed|`2 * "Hey "`|`"Hey Hey "`|

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The `*` operator is **overloaded**:
    
    - With numbers → multiplication
        
    - With strings and integers → repetition
        
- Multiplying strings by other strings is not valid
    
- Try both forms: `"text" * number` or `number * "text"`
