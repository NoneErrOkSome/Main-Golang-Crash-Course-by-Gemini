## ✖️🔬 **Part 4: Multiplication and Float Precision**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Perform **multiplication** with variables in Python
    
- Understand the use of the `*` operator
    
- Learn about **floating point precision issues**
    
- See how **Python’s float math** differs from real algebra

## ✖️ **Step 1: Basic Multiplication in Python**

To multiply numbers or variables, use the asterisk `*`.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
x = 7
y = 4.1
print(x * y)
```

✅ Output:

```
28.699999999999996
```

Wait, what? Shouldn't it be `28.7`?

---

## 🧠 **Step 2: Why Is Python Getting It “Wrong”?**

Let’s break it down:

- `x = 7`
    
- `y = 4.1`
    
- In real math:  
    $7 \times 4 = 28$  
    $7 \times 0.1 = 0.7$  
    $\Rightarrow 28 + 0.7 = 28.7$
    

But Python returns:

```
28.699999999999996
```

That’s off by a **tiny** bit. Why?

---

## ⚠️ **Floating Point Algebra ≠ Real Algebra**

Python uses **floating point arithmetic** internally, which **approximates** decimal numbers.

> This is a limitation of how computers store numbers in binary — they can't perfectly represent every decimal.

#### 🧠 Example:

- The number `0.1` has **no exact binary representation**, just like `1/3` has no exact decimal representation.
    

---

## 📦 **This Is Called: Floating Point Algebra**

> Floating Point Algebra means:  
> _"Computers use **approximations** of real numbers, with limited precision."_

So calculations like `7 * 4.1` may produce:

- Slightly more or less than expected
    
- Tiny decimal offsets (e.g., `28.699999999999996`)
    

---

## ✅ What Should You Do About It?

Most of the time, this is **nothing to worry about**.

But if you need clean results, you can **round**:

```python
print(round(x * y, 2))   # ✅ Output: 28.7
```

---

## 📋 Summary Table

|Operation|Code|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Multiplication|`x * y`|`28.699999999999996`|
|Real-world math|`7 * 4.1`|`28.7`|
|Clean output|`round(x * y, 2)`|`28.7`|

---

## 🧱 Key Takeaways

- Use `*` for multiplication
    
- Python uses **floating point math**, which can cause tiny inaccuracies
    
- These are not bugs — they’re due to the **limits of binary representation**
    
- You can fix visual issues using `round()` when needed
