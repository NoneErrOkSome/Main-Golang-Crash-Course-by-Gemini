Absolutely! Here's a **deep dive into Part 2: Using `%whos` to Inspect Variables**, scoped tightly to the transcript and with full clarity.

## 📋🔍 **Part 2: Using `%whos` to Inspect Variables**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Use **Jupyter’s built-in magic command** `%whos` to inspect all variables in memory
    
- Understand the difference between `%who` and `%whos`
    
- Identify variable **names**, **types**, and **values**
    
- Practice tracking data types like `int` and `float`
    

---

## 🧠 **What Is `%whos`?**

`%whos` is a **Jupyter magic command** (available only in Jupyter environments like Google Colab, JupyterLab, etc.)

It gives you a **neatly formatted table** showing:

- Variable names
    
- Their data types
    
- Their current values
    

---

## 🧪 **Try It Out in a Notebook**

Let’s say you’ve already run this code:

```python
x = 7
y = 4.1
z = 0
```

Then you run:

```python
%whos
```

✅ Output:

```
Variable   Type     Data/Info
-----------------------------
x          int      7
y          float    4.1
z          int      0
```

Now you clearly see:

- `x` is of type `int`
    
- `y` is of type `float`
    
- `z` is also `int`

## 🧾 **%whos vs %who – What’s the Difference?**

|Command|Description|Output Type|
|---|---|---|
|`%who`|Lists **only variable names**|Names only|
|`%whos`|Shows **names, types, and values**|Full table|

### Example:

```python
%who
```

Result:

```
x  y  z
```

Just names — no details.

## 🔍 **Why Use `%whos`?**

Because after running many cells, you might forget:

- What variables you’ve already created
    
- What type they are (int, float, str, list, etc.)
    
- What value they currently hold
    

✅ `%whos` keeps your workspace transparent and manageable.

---

## 🧱 **Best Practices**

- Use `%whos` **before running new math** to double-check variable types
    
- Especially useful after doing something like:
    
    ```python
    x = "seven"
    ```
    
    You might have accidentally changed a number to a string! Check with:
    
    ```python
    %whos
    ```

## 📦 **Summary Table**

|Command|Use Case|Shows|
|---|---|---|
|`%who`|Quick check of variable names|Just names|
|`%whos`|Full inspection of current variables|Names, types, values|
