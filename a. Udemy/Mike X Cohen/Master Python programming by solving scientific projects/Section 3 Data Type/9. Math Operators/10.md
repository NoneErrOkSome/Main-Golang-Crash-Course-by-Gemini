Absolutely! Here's **Part 10: Invalid String Operations & Experimentation**, explained clearly and precisely with any math using **plain text LaTeX syntax** as you requested.

## ❌🧪 **Part 10: Invalid String Operations & Experimentation**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Explore what happens when you try to use **invalid operations** on strings
    
- Understand Python’s **TypeError**
    
- Encourage learning through **experimentation**
    
- Contrast behavior between numbers and strings
    

---

## ❌ **1. Subtracting Strings**

Trying this:

```python
"Mike" - "Cohen"
```

❌ Output:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
```

> Why? Because `-` is **not defined** for string types — Python doesn’t know how to subtract one string from another.

---

## ❌ **2. Dividing Strings**

Try this:

```python
"Mike" / 2
```

❌ Output:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
```

Just like subtraction, the division operator `/` is **not overloaded** for strings.

---

## ✅ **3. Multiplying Strings (Valid)**

This is valid:

```python
"Mike" * 2
```

✅ Output:

```
MikeMike
```

This repeats the string **2 times**.

> In math: $$ \text{"Mike"} \times 2 = \text{"MikeMike"} $$

## 🔁 **Operator Compatibility Table**

|Operator|With Numbers|With Strings|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|`+`|Addition|Concatenation|Valid for both|
|`-`|Subtraction|❌ Not supported|TypeError|
|`*`|Multiplication|Repetition (int × str)|Valid for both|
|`/`|Division|❌ Not supported|TypeError|

---

## 🧪 **Try It Yourself — Quick Test**

```python
first = "Mike"
print(first * 3)      # MikeMikeMike
print(first - "Mi")   # ❌ Error
print(first / 2)      # ❌ Error
```

✅ Use these experiments to reinforce what’s allowed and what’s not.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy from the Transcript

> “I’m a huge fan of experimenting around with code... because playing around with code is a really great way to learn the coding language.”

This means:

- **Try things intentionally**
    
- Expect some things to **break**
    
- Learn from Python’s **error messages**
    

---

## 📌 Summary

- Not all operators work with all data types.
    
- Strings can be **added** and **multiplied**.
    
- Strings **cannot** be **subtracted** or **divided**.
    
- Trying unsupported operations will give a **TypeError**.
    
- Use errors as **learning moments**, not roadblocks.
