## 🧵🔡 **Part 8: String Variables & Concatenation**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Create and store text (string) data in variables
    
- Use the `+` operator to **join (concatenate)** strings
    
- Understand how Python applies **operator overloading**
    
- Add formatting such as spaces between strings
    

---

## 🧾 **Step 1: Creating String Variables**

Strings are sequences of characters surrounded by quotes.

```python
first_name = "Mike"
last_name = "Cohen"
```

- These are variables storing text values.
    
- You can use **single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes**.
    

---

## ➕ **Step 2: Concatenating Strings**

Now try combining them using the `+` operator:

```python
print(first_name + last_name)
```

✅ Output:

```
MikeCohen
```

> There is **no space** between them — because `+` just glues them directly.

---

## ✅ **Adding a Space Between Strings**

To add a space between words, include a `" "` string explicitly:

```python
print(first_name + " " + last_name)
```

✅ Output:

```
Mike Cohen
```

This is:

- First string
    
- Plus a space string `" "`
    
- Plus the last string

## 🧠 **What Is Operator Overloading?**

The `+` operator usually means **addition** for numbers:

$$ 3 + 4 = 7 $$

But here, it means **concatenation** for strings:

```python
"Hello" + "World" → "HelloWorld"
```

This behavior is called **operator overloading**:

> The same symbol behaves differently based on the **data type**.

---

## ⚠️ **Invalid Operations with Strings**

Trying subtraction:

```python
first_name - last_name
```

❌ Output:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
```

> You **cannot subtract strings** — it’s not a defined operation.

## 📦 Summary Table

|Operation|Python Code|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Concatenate (no space)|`first_name + last_name`|`"MikeCohen"`|
|Concatenate with space|`first_name + " " + last_name`|`"Mike Cohen"`|
|Invalid subtraction|`first_name - last_name`|❌ TypeError|

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Use `+` to **join strings**
    
- Add a space manually using `" "` when needed
    
- `+` is **overloaded**: it adds numbers, but concatenates strings
    
- Other math operators like `-` don’t work on strings
