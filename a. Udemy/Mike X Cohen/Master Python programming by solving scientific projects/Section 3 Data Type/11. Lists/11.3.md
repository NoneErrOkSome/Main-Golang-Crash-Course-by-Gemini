### ✅ **Part 3: List Operations and Boolean Expressions**

#### 🔎 **Membership Testing with `in` and `not in`**

You can test whether a value is present in a list using:

```python
4 in a_list      # Returns: True
4.5 in a_list    # Returns: False
4.5 not in a_list  # Returns: True
```

✅ `in` checks whether the value **exists in the list**.  
✅ `not in` is the opposite: checks whether the value **does not exist**.

⚠️ These return **Boolean values**:

- `True` or `False`
    
- A **Boolean** is a special data type representing logical truth values.

#### ➕ **List Addition (Concatenation)**

```python
a_list + string_list
```

✅ This combines both lists into **one longer list**:

```python
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Mike']
```

🧠 Python doesn't try to add numbers to strings — it simply appends all elements together.

---

#### ✖️ **List Multiplication (Repetition)**

```python
a_list * 3
```

✅ Repeats the list **three times**:

```python
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This is the **same behavior as multiplying strings**:

```python
"Mike" * 3  →  'MikeMikeMike'
```

⚠️ **Important**:  
This does **not multiply each number** by 3. It just **repeats the whole list**.

---

#### 🧠 If You Want Element-wise Multiplication...

That requires:

- A `for` loop, or
    
- A `NumPy` array (introduced later in the course)
    

```python
# Example with for loop (not covered yet)
[x * 3 for x in a_list]
```

In this part, you learned:

- How to check list membership
    
- How Python uses Booleans (`True`, `False`)
    
- How list addition means **joining**
    
- How list multiplication means **repeating**, not scaling
