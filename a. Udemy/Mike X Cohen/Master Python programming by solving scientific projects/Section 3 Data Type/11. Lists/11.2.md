### ✅ **Part 2: Introduction to Lists**

---

#### 📦 **What is a List?**

- A **list** is an **ordered collection** of items.
    
- Lists are **flexible**: they can contain numbers, strings, mixed types, or even **other lists**.
    
- Python uses **square brackets** `[]` to define a list.

#### 🔢 **Creating a Numeric List**

```python
a_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

✅ Each item is separated by a **comma**.  
✅ You can include **any number of elements**.  
✅ Python considers this a **list** type: use `whos` to see the type and length.

---

#### 🔤 **Creating a String List**

```python
string_list = ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Mike"]
```

✅ Still a list — but the elements are **strings** instead of numbers.  
✅ Python shows the **type as list**, even though the contents are strings.

---

#### 🔁 **Creating a Mixed-Type List**

```python
mixed_list = [4.5, "hello", "7", 7, 7.0]
```

✅ This list has:

- A float `4.5`
    
- A string `"hello"`
    
- A string `"7"`
    
- An integer `7`
    
- A float `7.0`
    

🎯 Different data types can **coexist** inside one list.  
🧠 But be careful: each item’s **type still matters** when performing operations.

---

#### 🪆 **Nested Lists (Lists within Lists)**

```python
list_list = [3, [3, 4, 4], [5, 5, 999]]
```

✅ You can **nest lists inside lists**.  
✅ This makes the structure more powerful (like matrices or tables later).

---

#### 🧹 **Multiline Lists for Readability**

```python
my_list = [
    3,            # This is a number
    [3, 4, 4],    # This is a nested list
    [5, 5, 999]   # Another nested list
]
```

✅ Python **does not care** about line breaks **inside brackets**.  
✅ You can press **Enter** to improve readability and add **inline comments**.

🧠 You **don’t need a backslash** `\` inside brackets — Python understands you're continuing the list.

This part explains how lists work in structure, formatting, and content. Ready to move on to Part 3 (working with lists and Boolean checks)?
