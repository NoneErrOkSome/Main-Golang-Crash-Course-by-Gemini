### ✅ **Part 5: Exercise – Count Elements in a List**

---

#### 🧪 **Your Exercise Goal**

You are asked to:

1. **Create a new list** containing several items.
    
2. Make sure it includes **multiple instances of the number `7`**.
    
3. Use a **list method** to **count how many times** the number `7` appears in that list.
    

---

#### ✅ **Step-by-Step Guide**

##### 🧱 1. Create a List

```python
my_list = [7, 3, 7, 1, 9, 7, 2]
```

✅ This list contains three 7s.

---

##### 🔢 2. Use the `.count()` Method

```python
my_list.count(7)
```

✅ This returns `3`, because the number `7` appears three times.

💡 `.count(value)` returns the number of **exact matches** of that value.

---

#### ⚠️ Common Mistake: Don’t Confuse String `"7"` with Number `7`

```python
my_list = [7, "7", 7]

my_list.count(7)     # Returns: 2
my_list.count("7")   # Returns: 1
```

✅ Python **treats different types differently**, even if they look similar.  
`7` (integer) ≠ `"7"` (string)

---

#### 💡 Bonus Tip

You can count **any element** in a list using `.count()` — works with:

- numbers,
    
- strings,
    
- booleans,
    
- or any other values that can be compared.
    

```python
["apple", "banana", "apple"].count("apple")  # Returns: 2
```

---

🎯 **Wrap-Up of Part 5:**

- Use `.count()` to count specific values in a list
    
- Make sure you're matching **type and value**
    
- It's a powerful tool for data analysis and validation
