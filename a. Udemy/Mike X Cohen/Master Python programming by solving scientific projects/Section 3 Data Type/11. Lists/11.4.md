### ✅ **Part 4: List Methods**

---

#### 🧩 **What is a Method?**

A **method** is like a **function**, but it’s specific to a particular **data type** (like lists).

✅ Syntax: `variable.method(arguments)`

✅ The method is **called on the list itself**, using a dot `.` before the method name.

---

#### ➕ **`.append()` — Add an Item to the End**

```python
a_list.append(-100)
```

✅ Adds `-100` to the **end** of `a_list`.  
✅ Modifies the original list **in place** (permanently).

```python
print(a_list)  
# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -100]
```

---

#### 🔃 **`.sort()` — Sort the List in Ascending Order**

```python
a_list.sort()
```

✅ Sorts the list **numerically or alphabetically**.  
✅ Also modifies the original list **in place**.

```python
print(a_list)
# Output: [-100, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

⚠️ Works **only** when the list contains compatible types  
(e.g., all numbers or all strings — not a mix).

---

#### 🧪 **Order of Operations (Multiple Methods)**

You can run multiple method calls one after the other:

```python
a_list.append(2.5)
a_list.sort()
```

This appends `2.5`, then sorts the list again:

```python
# Output: [-100, 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

#### 🧠 **Viewing All Available Methods**

You can type:

```python
a_list.
```

…and your IDE or notebook (like Jupyter or Colab) will show **autocomplete suggestions**.

🔍 This includes:

- `append()`
    
- `sort()`
    
- `count()`
    
- `index()`
    
- `insert()`
    
- `remove()`
    
- `pop()`
    
- and many others...
    

🧠 Each of these is designed specifically to work with **list-type variables**.

---

In this part, you learned how to:

- Use `.append()` and `.sort()`
    
- Understand method syntax
    
- See that list methods **change the list directly**
    
- Explore other methods via autocomplete
