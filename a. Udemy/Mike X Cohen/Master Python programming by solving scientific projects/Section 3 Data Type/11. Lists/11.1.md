### ✅ **Part 1: Managing the Jupyter Environment**

#### 🧹 **Deleting a Cell**

- Sometimes a code cell contains errors, clutter, or just something you no longer need.
    
- In Jupyter Notebook environments (like Google Colab or JupyterLab), you can delete a cell using a trash icon 🗑️ or a scissor ✂️ icon.
    

💡 **Important Notes:**

- **In Colab**: The trash icon is visible near the top-right of each cell.
    
- **In other environments** (e.g., JupyterLab, VSCode): Look for a scissor or trash icon in the toolbar or right-click menu.
    
- The icon's location may vary, so you might have to look around — but it's always within reach.

#### 🔄 **Restarting the Python Runtime / Environment**

Restarting clears **all variables** and resets the kernel. This is useful when:

- You’ve defined too many variables and want to reset.
    
- You're debugging and want to start fresh.
    

##### ✅ **Steps to Restart:**

1. Click **Runtime** in the menu.
    
2. Choose **Restart runtime**.
    
3. Confirm the pop-up that says:
    
    > "Are you sure you want to restart the runtime? All local variables will be lost."
    

✅ After restarting:

- Run `whos` to check if the workspace is empty.
    
- You should see:
    
    > The interactive namespace is empty.
    

💡 **Environment Differences**:

- The exact wording or location of "Restart runtime" may differ slightly between Jupyter, Colab, or other tools.
    
- Look for terms like:
    
    - **Restart kernel**
        
    - **Clear and restart**
        
    - **Restart & Run All**

This part is mostly about **cleaning and resetting your workspace** so you can work in a fresh Python environment without clutter or leftover variables from previous runs.
