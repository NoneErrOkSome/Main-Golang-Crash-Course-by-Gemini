## 🧱 **Part 1: Introduction & Environment Setup**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To understand what environment you'll be working in, how to interact with it, and why it's important to follow along interactively.

---

### 🖥️ **Jupyter Notebook Platforms Mentioned**

Python can be used in many environments that support **Jupyter notebooks**. These are interactive documents that mix code, output, and explanations in one place.

Here are the platforms mentioned:

|Platform|Description|
|---|---|
|**Google Colab**|Cloud-based, free, no setup needed. Saves in Google Drive.|
|**Kaggle Notebooks**|Also cloud-based, oriented around data science competitions.|
|**Jupyter.org (Online)**|Interactive demo via browser, no account or setup needed.|
|**Anaconda (Local Install)**|Desktop-based IDE with Jupyter included. Great for offline development.|

---

### 💡 **Key Takeaway**

> It doesn’t matter **which platform** you use — what matters is that you follow along in a Jupyter notebook to learn actively.

---

### 🧪 **Why Follow Along?**

- Reinforces **muscle memory** of typing and running code.
    
- Helps **visualize** the execution process.
    
- Lets you **experiment and make mistakes**, which is part of learning.
    
- Makes debugging and learning **less passive**.

### 🧩 **What is a Cell?**

A **cell** in Jupyter is a container for:

- Code 🧑‍💻
    
- Output 📤
    
- Markdown notes 📝
    

Think of cells like **paragraphs of code**:

- Group **related lines** of code in one cell.
    
- Start a **new idea** in a new cell.
    

You can:

- **Edit** a cell (click inside it).
    
- **Run** a cell (use `Ctrl+Enter` or `Shift+Enter`).
    
- **Add new cells** (from the +Code button or keyboard shortcuts).

### ✅ **Cell Execution Summary**

|Action|Shortcut|What it Does|
|---|---|---|
|Run cell|`Ctrl + Enter`|Executes the current cell.|
|Run and go to next|`Shift + Enter`|Executes current cell and creates/selects the next cell.|
|Add new code cell|`+ Code` button|Adds a fresh cell below.|

---

### 🛠️ **What to Do in This Part**

1. Open a Jupyter environment (e.g., Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/))
    
2. Create a **new notebook**.
    
3. Click into the first **code cell**.
    
4. Type a line like:
    

```python
# This is my first cell
```

5. Press `Ctrl + Enter` to run it.
    
6. Try adding a new cell with `Shift + Enter`.
