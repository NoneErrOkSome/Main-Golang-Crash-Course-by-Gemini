## 🔤📛 **Part 8: Variable Naming Rules**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Learn the **rules and best practices** for naming variables in Python
    
- Understand what names are **valid** vs. **invalid**
    
- Avoid common mistakes when naming variables
    
- Use meaningful, readable names instead of just `a`, `b`, `c`
    

---

## ✅ **Valid Variable Names**

A valid variable name in Python:

1. Must **start with a letter** (A–Z or a–z) or an **underscore** (`_`)
    
2. Can contain **letters**, **numbers**, and **underscores**
    
3. **Cannot contain spaces** or special characters like `@`, `!`, `%`, `-`, or `#`
    
4. **Cannot start with a number**
    

---

### 🧪 Examples of Valid Names

```python
filter_order = 2048
data2plot = 3
_data = "hidden"
```

✅ These all work perfectly.

---

## ❌ **Invalid Variable Names**

These will cause **syntax errors**:

|Invalid Name|Why it's invalid|
|---|---|
|`2data`|Starts with a number|
|`data-plot`|Hyphen `-` is not allowed|
|`data plot`|Spaces are not allowed|
|`data@home`|`@` symbol is not allowed|
|`filter order`|Space in the middle|

### 🔥 Try This:

```python
2data = 3         # ❌ SyntaxError
data@home = 5     # ❌ SyntaxError
```

---

## 🚫 **Reserved Words**

Python has certain **keywords** you can't use as variable names because they’re part of the language.

Examples include:

```python
class, def, if, else, return, True, False, while, for, import, from
```

> 💡 If you use these, Python will get confused — they’re already used for special meanings.

---

## 📚 **Case Sensitivity**

Python is **case-sensitive**.

```python
name = "Alice"
Name = "Bob"
```

These are two **different** variables.

---

## 💡 **Use Descriptive Names**

Instead of this:

```python
a = 10
b = 5
```

Use this:

```python
filter_order = 10
cutoff_freq = 5
```

> Clear names make your code easier to read and debug later.

---

## 🧾 **Underscore Is Your Friend**

Use `_` to separate words for readability:

```python
total_sum = 100
average_score = 95
```

> This style is called **snake_case** and it’s the most common in Python.

---

## 🧱 Summary Table

|Valid Name|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`name`|✅ Simple name|
|`data2plot`|✅ Includes numbers (not at start)|
|`filter_order`|✅ Uses underscore|
|`_hidden_value`|✅ Starts with underscore|

|Invalid Name|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`2data`|❌ Starts with a number|
|`data-plot`|❌ Contains hyphen|
|`class`|❌ Reserved keyword|
|`data plot`|❌ Contains a space|
