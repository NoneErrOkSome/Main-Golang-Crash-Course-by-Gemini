Of course! Here's the detailed breakdown of **Part 7: Printing Multiple Variables**.

## 🖨️📦 **Part 7: Printing Multiple Variables**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Understand how to use `print()` with **multiple variables**
    
- Learn what the **comma** inside `print()` actually does
    
- See how it works for **strings and numbers**
    
- Avoid formatting mistakes when printing values

## 🔁 **How to Print Multiple Variables**

You can use the `print()` function with **multiple arguments** separated by commas.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
a = 4
b = 3
print(a, b)
```

✅ Output:

```
4 3
```

The **comma inside `print()`** adds a **space** between the outputs.

---

## 📝 **Print Strings Together**

```python
d = "hello"
e = "world"
print(d, e)
```

✅ Output:

```
hello world
```

> The space between them is automatically added by `print()`.

---

## 🔢📝 **Mixing Numbers and Strings**

```python
a = 4
b = "apples"
print(a, b)
```

✅ Output:

```
4 apples
```

Python handles different **data types** inside the same `print()` call just fine — as long as you separate them with commas.

---

## ❗️ What if You Don’t Use Commas?

Let’s say you try:

```python
print(a b)
```

❌ You'll get a **SyntaxError**:

```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

> You **must** separate variables with commas when using them inside `print()`.

---

## ⚠️ What About Spaces?

Trying this:

```python
print(a b)
```

…isn’t the same as:

```python
print(a, b)
```

The **comma** is a separator. It’s not optional — spaces alone don’t work.

---

## 🧱 **Summary Table**

|Code|Output|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|`print(a)`|`4`|Prints one variable|
|`print(a, b)`|`4 3`|Prints two variables with space in between|
|`print(d, e)`|`hello world`|Works for strings|
|`print(a, b, c)`|`4 3 7`|Prints many variables|
|`print(a b)`|❌ Error|Missing comma → invalid syntax|

---

## ✅ Best Practice

Use `print()` consistently to:

- Display multiple variables
    
- Mix data types safely
    
- Debug more easily
    

It’s good style to **always use `print()`**, even if Jupyter could auto-show the last line.
