## 🖨️ **Part 3: Printing and Output Rules**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To understand:

- How Python and Jupyter display output
    
- Why only the **last line** in a cell shows output
    
- How to use the `print()` function to control output
    
- How to print **multiple variables**

### 📦 **How Jupyter Displays Output**

When you run a cell in Jupyter, Python **automatically displays the result of the last expression** (only if it's not an assignment or a function call).

#### Example:

```python
a = 4
b = 3
a
b
```

✅ Output:

```
3
```

> ❗️Only `b` is shown because it's the **last line** that isn't an assignment or a function call.

---

### 🖨️ **Using `print()` to Show Output Explicitly**

The `print()` function tells Python: “Display this in the output.”

#### Example:

```python
print(a)
print(b)
```

✅ Output:

```
4
3
```

So now, you get to see **both values**.

### 🧠 **Why Use `print()`?**

- More **explicit** and **clear** about what’s being shown
    
- Works even when it's **not the last line**
    
- Helps when you’re debugging
    
- Can be used to print **text + variables** together
    

---

### 🧪 **Try It Yourself**

```python
a = 4
b = 3
print(a)
print(b)
```

Then try without `print()`:

```python
a = 4
b = 3
a
b
```

Notice the difference.

---

### 🧾 **Printing Multiple Variables in One Line**

You can also pass multiple values to `print()` using commas:

```python
print(a, b)
```

✅ Output:

```
4 3
```

> Commas insert **spaces** between values (not commas). This is handy for compact output.

---

### 🛑 **What If You Don't Use `print()`?**

This will **not** work as intended:

```python
a, b
```

✅ Output:

```
(4, 3)
```

> You’ll get a **tuple** — which isn’t what you want when simply printing values cleanly.

---

### ✅ **Best Practice**

Even though Jupyter can show the last expression, it’s **good habit** to use `print()` when:

- Writing **more than one line**
    
- Printing multiple things
    
- Writing code for others
    
- Wanting consistent behavior across Python scripts

### 🧩 **Summary Table**

|Syntax|Output|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|`a`|`4`|Only works if it’s the **last line**|
|`print(a)`|`4`|Always shows output|
|`print(a, b)`|`4 3`|Shows both values separated by space|
|`a, b`|`(4, 3)`|Returns a **tuple**|
