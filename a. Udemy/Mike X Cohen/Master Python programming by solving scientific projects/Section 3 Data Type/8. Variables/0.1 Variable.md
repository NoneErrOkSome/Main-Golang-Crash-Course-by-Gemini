**Summary of key details:**

1. **Jupyter Notebook Basics:**
    
    - Jupyter notebooks consist of **cells** that contain code.
        
    - Each cell runs independently; you execute cells to run Python code.
        
    - Execute a cell using:
        
        - **Ctrl+Enter** (runs the cell).
            
        - **Shift+Enter** (runs the cell and creates a new one below).
            
2. **Variables:**
    
    - Variables store data values (numbers, strings, etc.).
        
    - Assigning variables:
        
        ```python
        a = 4  # integer variable
        b = 3  # integer variable
        d = 'Hello'  # string variable
        ```
        
    - Python does not execute code written in cells until explicitly run.
        
3. **Output Display:**
    
    - Jupyter displays the output of the **last line** of a cell automatically, provided it's just a variable or expression.
        
    - For multiple outputs or intermediate values, use the `print()` function:
        
        ```python
        print(a, b, d)
        ```
        
4. **Variable Types:**
    
    - **Integers** (`int`): Whole numbers, e.g., `4`, `2048`.
        
    - **Strings** (`str`): Text, created with single `'...'` or double `"..."` quotes:
        
        ```python
        greeting = 'Hello'
        statement = "Mike's favorite color"
        ```
        
    - Single and double quotes are interchangeable, but double quotes allow for apostrophes inside.
        
5. **Variable Naming Rules:**
    
    - Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
        
    - **Cannot** start with a number.
        
    - **Cannot** contain spaces or special characters (`!`, `@`, `$`, etc.), except `_`.
        
    - Examples:
        
        ```python
        valid_variable = 10
        data2plot = 3
        # invalid: 2dataplot = 3
        ```
        
6. **Comments:**
    
    - Use `#` to indicate comments that Python ignores:
        
        ```python
        a = 5  # this is a comment
        # this entire line is a comment
        ```
        
    - Comments **cannot** appear in the middle of code expressions.
        
7. **Multiple Assignments:**
    
    - Assign multiple variables in a single line (though generally discouraged for clarity):
        
        ```python
        f, g = 10, 20
        ```
        
8. **Inspecting Variables:**
    
    - Use `%whos` in a cell to list all current variables and their types:
        
        ```python
        %whos
        ```
        
9. **Exercise (Two Parts):**
    
    - **Part 1:** Test if a variable can be overwritten with a new value of the **same type**.
        
    - **Part 2:** Test if a variable can be overwritten with a value of a **different type** (e.g., integer to string).
        
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    a = 4          # Original integer variable
    a = 40         # Test same type overwrite (int -> int)
    a = 'hello'    # Test different type overwrite (int -> str)
    ```
