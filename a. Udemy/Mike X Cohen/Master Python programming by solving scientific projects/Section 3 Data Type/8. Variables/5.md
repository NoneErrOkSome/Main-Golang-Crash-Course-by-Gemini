Absolutely! Here's the detailed breakdown of **Part 5: Errors and Execution Order**.

## ❌ **Part 5: Errors and Execution Order**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To understand:

- Why **errors happen** in Jupyter notebooks
    
- What a **`NameError`** means
    
- How **cell execution order** affects your code
    
- Why you must **run a cell before using its variables**
    

---

### ⚠️ **The Illusion of Writing Code**

Typing in a cell **does nothing** unless you **run** the cell. Python will not understand or store anything you wrote unless you explicitly tell it to run.

---

### 💥 **Common Error: `NameError`**

Let’s say you write this in one cell:

```python
c = 7
```

Then in a new cell:

```python
print(c)
```

If you **didn’t run the first cell**, you'll get this:

```
NameError: name 'c' is not defined
```

> This means: “I have no idea what `c` is — you never told me about it.”

---

### 🧠 **Why Did This Happen?**

Because:

- The **first cell was never executed**.
    
- So `c` never actually existed in Python’s memory.
    
- Python only knows about variables that were **actually assigned** in previously **executed** cells.
    

---

### 📏 **Jupyter Cells Are Not Always Run in Order**

Even if the cells **appear in order top to bottom**, you can run them in **any sequence**. This means:

|Scenario|Result|
|---|---|
|You run cell 2 before cell 1|You might reference undefined variables|
|You change a value in cell 1|You must **rerun it** for the change to apply|

> 💡 Best practice: Run your notebook **top to bottom**, especially after editing things.

---

### 🧪 **Try This Exercise**

**Step 1: Create a variable**  
In one cell:

```python
x = 99
```

**Step 2: Print it**  
In another cell:

```python
print(x)
```

Now:

- Don’t run the first cell.
    
- Run only the second one.
    

❌ You'll see:

```
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

Now:

- Run the **first** cell.
    
- Then run the second cell again.
    

✅ Output:

```
99
```

---

### ✅ **Lesson Summary**

|Rule|Why it Matters|
|---|---|
|Cells must be **executed** to take effect|Python ignores unexecuted code|
|You’ll get a `NameError` for undefined names|Python doesn’t remember unassigned variables|
|Cells can be run **out of order**|Always re-run things **top to bottom**|
|Running a cell stores variables in memory|So future cells can use them|
