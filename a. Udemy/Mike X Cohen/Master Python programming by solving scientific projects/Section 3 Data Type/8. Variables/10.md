Absolutely! Here's the full expansion of **Part 10: Extra Features & Exercises** — the final part of this section.

## 🧠🧪 **Part 10: Extra Features & Exercises**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Learn about **multiple assignment** in Python
    
- See how to **list all variables** in your notebook
    
- Understand **overwriting variables**
    
- Practice with a small hands-on **exercise**
    

---

## 🔁 **Multiple Assignment (Assign Multiple Variables at Once)**

You can assign **multiple variables** in a single line using commas:

```python
f, g = 10, 20
print(f, g)
```

✅ Output:

```
10 20
```

Python automatically:

- Assigns `10` to `f`
    
- Assigns `20` to `g`
    

> This is called **unpacking a tuple**.

---

### ⚠️ **Should You Use This?**

It works, but don't overuse it. It’s okay for:

- Simple values
    
- Very short variable names
    

❗️But avoid this in complex situations. It can reduce **readability** and lead to confusion.

#### 🚫 Don’t Do This:

```python
x, y, z, a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  # too much in one line!
```

---

## 📋 **List All Variables in Memory**

Use the **magic command**:

```python
%whos
```

✅ Output:  
Displays a **table** of all current variables and their types.

|Variable|Type|Data/Value|
|---|---|---|
|a|int|4|
|b|int|3|
|d|str|'hello'|
|...|...|...|

> Very helpful to **see what’s in memory**, especially after running many cells.

You can also use:

```python
%who     # just shows variable names
%whos    # shows type and value
```

---

## 🔁 **Overwriting Variables**

### 🧪 Can You Change a Variable’s Value?

Yes. You can **overwrite** a variable just by reassigning it:

```python
a = 4
a = 40
print(a)
```

✅ Output:

```
40
```

You don’t need to make a new variable every time.

---

### 🔄 **Overwrite with a Different Type?**

Yes! Python allows **dynamic typing**:

```python
a = 4         # integer
a = "hello"   # string
print(a)
```

✅ Output:

```
hello
```

Python doesn’t care that `a` was an `int` before — now it’s a `str`.

---

## 🧩 **Exercise (Your Turn!)**

Try the following in your notebook:

### 🔹 Part 1: Overwriting with Same Type

```python
x = 10
x = 50
print(x)    # Expect: 50
```

### 🔹 Part 2: Overwriting with Different Type

```python
x = "hello"
print(x)    # Expect: hello
```

### 🔹 Part 3: Multiple Assignment

```python
p, q = 1, 2
print(p, q)
```

### 🔹 Part 4: View All Variables

```python
%whos
```

## ✅ Summary

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|`f, g = 10, 20`|Multiple assignment|
|`%whos`|List all variables with types and values|
|Variable overwriting|Reassign new value (same or different type)|
|Dynamic typing|Variables can switch types (int → str, etc.)|
