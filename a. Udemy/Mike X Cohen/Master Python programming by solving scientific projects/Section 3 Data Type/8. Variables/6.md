## 🔢📝 **Part 6: Data Types – Integers and Strings**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Understand what **data types** are in Python
    
- Learn two common types: **integers** and **strings**
    
- See how to create them, use them, and avoid common mistakes
    

---

### 🧠 **What Is a Data Type?**

A **data type** defines the kind of value a variable holds.

Think of it like the **category** of a variable:

- Is it a number?
    
- Is it text?
    
- Is it a list?
    
- Is it True/False?
    

> Python needs to know **how** to handle each kind of value — that's why types matter.

---

## 🔢 **Integers (`int`)**

These are **whole numbers** — no decimals.

#### Examples:

```python
a = 4
b = -12
c = 0
```

Each of these is an **integer**, and Python will treat them as numbers you can add, subtract, etc.

---

## 🧾 **Strings (`str`)**

A **string** is text — any sequence of characters wrapped in **quotes**.

#### Examples:

```python
greeting = 'hello'
color = "purple"
```

> You can use either **single quotes** (`'`) or **double quotes** (`"`). Python treats them the same.

---

### ⚠️ **Why Do We Use Quotes for Strings?**

If you **don’t** use quotes, Python thinks it’s a **variable** or **function name**.

#### Example:

```python
word = hello   # ❌ ERROR: Python thinks 'hello' is a variable that doesn't exist
word = 'hello' # ✅ Works fine
```

---

### 💡 **When to Use Single vs. Double Quotes?**

They’re interchangeable, **except** when your string contains one of them.

#### Example: Apostrophe

```python
msg = "Mike's notebook"   # ✅ works fine
msg = 'Mike\'s notebook'  # ✅ also fine with escape (\)
```

> Best practice: Use double quotes if the string contains apostrophes.

---

### 🧪 **Try This in a Cell**

```python
d = 'hello'
e = "Mike likes purple"
f = "Mike's favorite color is purple"
```

Now try:

```python
print(d)
print(e, f)
```

✅ Output:

```
hello
Mike likes purple Mike's favorite color is purple
```

---

### 🧱 **Common Mistakes**

#### ❌ Missing quotes

```python
x = hello  # NameError
```

#### ❌ Apostrophe breaks string

```python
quote = 'Mike's notebook'  # SyntaxError
```

---

### ✅ **Printing Multiple Types**

```python
a = 4
b = 'apples'
print(a, b)
```

✅ Output:

```
4 apples
```

Python can print **different types** together using commas.

---

### 📋 **Summary Table**

|Example|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`a = 7`|`int`|Whole number|
|`b = 'hello'`|`str`|Text with single quotes|
|`c = "Mike's choice"`|`str`|Text with apostrophe, double quotes help|
|`print(a, b, c)`|—|Outputs all variables together|
