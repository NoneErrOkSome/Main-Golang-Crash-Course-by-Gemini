## 🔢 **Part 2: First Variable Assignment**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To understand how to:

- Assign values to variables in Python.
    
- Run cells to execute your code.
    
- Observe the effect of variable assignment and how Jupyter shows output.
    

---

### 🧠 **What Is a Variable?**

A **variable** is like a labeled box in memory that stores data. You give it a name, and you assign it a value.

#### 🧾 Syntax:

```python
a = 4
```

- `a` is the **name** of the variable.
    
- `=` is the **assignment operator**.
    
- `4` is the **value** being stored.
    

> 💡 In Python, this means: “Store the value 4 inside the variable called a.”

---

### 🧪 **Try It Out**

In a new cell, type:

```python
a = 4
```

Now, press:

- `Ctrl + Enter` → runs the cell and stays on it.
    
- `Shift + Enter` → runs the cell and creates a new one below.
    

---

### ⚠️ **Important! Running Matters**

Just typing `a = 4` doesn’t **do anything** unless you **run** the cell. Python doesn’t evaluate code until it’s explicitly executed.

---

### 🧾 **Viewing the Value of a Variable**

To **see** the value stored in a variable:

```python
a
```

Then run the cell.

> ✅ Jupyter displays the **last line** of a cell that isn’t a command or assignment.

---

### 🔁 **Hands-On Demo**

Try this in a single cell:

```python
a = 4
a
```

Run the cell. You’ll see:

```
4
```

That’s the **output** area of the cell.

---

### 🔎 **Key Takeaways**

- Python uses **`=`** to assign values to variables.
    
- You must **run the cell** to execute your code.
    
- Jupyter only shows the result of the **last line** in a cell (if it’s not an assignment or function call).
    

---

### ✅ **Practice Time**

Try the following:

```python
b = 7
b
```

Then modify it:

```python
a = 4
b = 7
a
b
```

What output do you get? (Hint: Only `b` shows)

Want to see both? Then use:

```python
print(a)
print(b)
```
