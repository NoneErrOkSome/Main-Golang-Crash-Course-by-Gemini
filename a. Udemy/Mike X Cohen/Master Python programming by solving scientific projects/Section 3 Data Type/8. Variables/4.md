## ⌨️ **Part 4: Keyboard Shortcuts & Cells**

### 🎯 **Goal of this Part**

To learn how to:

- Efficiently **run code cells**
    
- **Create new cells** using buttons or keyboard shortcuts
    
- Speed up your workflow using **Jupyter notebook keyboard tips**

### 📦 **What Is a Cell? (Quick Recap)**

A **cell** in Jupyter is a box where you write and run your code. It's like a paragraph in a document:

- You can write code in one cell
    
- Add a new cell when starting a new idea or experiment

### ⚙️ **Running Cells with Shortcuts**

There are two main ways to run a cell:

#### ✅ Option 1: `Ctrl + Enter`

- Runs the current cell
    
- **Keeps the cursor in the same cell**
    

```python
a = 4
print(a)
# Press Ctrl + Enter
```

#### ✅ Option 2: `Shift + Enter`

- Runs the current cell
    
- **Moves to the next cell or creates one below**
    

```python
b = 5
print(b)
# Press Shift + Enter
```

> 💡 This is the **preferred shortcut** when writing a notebook top-down like a story.

### ➕ **Creating New Cells**

There are two ways:

#### 1. **Keyboard shortcut**

- Use `Shift + Enter` after running a cell → it automatically adds a new one below.
    

#### 2. **Manual using the + Code button**

- Click the **`+ Code`** button near the top left of the notebook.
    
- Adds a new code cell underneath the current one.

### 🧩 **Why Use Shortcuts?**

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|🚀 Faster Workflow|Don’t need to reach for the mouse every time|
|📖 Smooth Code Writing|Write and run code top to bottom seamlessly|
|🧠 Better Focus|Keeps you in a "typing zone" without breaking focus|

---

### ⌨️ **Common Shortcuts Summary**

|Action|Shortcut|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Run cell only|`Ctrl + Enter`|Stays on current cell|
|Run and insert next cell|`Shift + Enter`|Most commonly used shortcut|
|Add new code cell (manual)|`+ Code` button|Adds a cell below current one|
|Add new cell (keyboard)|`Esc`, then `B`|Adds a cell _Below_ (must be in command mode)|

### 🧪 **Try This Out in Your Notebook**

1. Type this in a new cell:
    
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    print(name)
    ```
    
2. Press `Ctrl + Enter`. Did it stay on the same cell?
    
3. Press `Shift + Enter`. Did it move to a new cell?
    

---

### 🧩 **Mini Challenge**

Try creating 3 variables in 3 separate cells. Use:

- `Shift + Enter` to move between cells
    
- `print()` to display each value
