## üí¨üî£ **Part 9: Comments in Python**

### üéØ **Goal of this Part**

To:

- Learn what **comments** are
    
- Understand how and why to use them
    
- Know the **syntax** for writing comments
    
- Avoid **misusing comments** in your code
    

---

## üß† **What Is a Comment?**

A **comment** is a note inside your code that Python will **ignore** when running the program.

> Comments are for **you** (the human), not the computer.

They help explain:

- What the code does
    
- Why something was written a certain way
    
- Reminders or notes to your future self (or other programmers)

## üñãÔ∏è **Syntax of a Comment**

To write a comment, start the line with a **`#` symbol**:

```python
# This is a comment
```

Python will ignore **everything after the `#`** on that line.

---

## üß™ **Example: Full-Line Comment**

```python
# This is a full-line comment
a = 5  # This is an inline comment
```

Both comments are valid:

- The first is a full-line comment
    
- The second is **at the end of a code line**
    

‚úÖ Output:

```
(no output ‚Äì comments are ignored)
```

---

## ‚ùå **Don‚Äôt Place Comments in the Middle of Code**

This is **not allowed**:

```python
a = # assign value
5
```

‚ùå You‚Äôll get a **SyntaxError**:

```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

> You can't break a code statement with a comment **in the middle**.

## üß© **Why Use Comments?**

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|Explain complex logic|`# This function filters out outliers`|
|Describe variable meaning|`cutoff = 5 # cutoff frequency in Hz`|
|Temporarily disable code|`# print("Debug info")`|
|Leave reminders or TODOs|`# TODO: optimize this function`|

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcut: Toggle Comment**

In most Jupyter environments:

- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + /`
    
- **Mac**: `Cmd + /`
    

This shortcut will:

- Add `#` to the beginning of the line if it‚Äôs not already a comment
    
- Remove `#` if it‚Äôs already a comment
    

> You can use this to **quickly comment or uncomment multiple lines** of code.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Comments

- Use **clear and concise** comments.
    
- Don‚Äôt comment obvious things:
    
    ```python
    a = 5  # Set a to 5 ‚Üê ‚ùå unnecessary
    ```
    
- Do comment **why**, not just **what**:
    
    ```python
    # Convert milliseconds to seconds for plotting
    time_sec = time_ms / 1000
    ```

## üß± Summary Table

|Type|Example|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Full-line comment|`# This is a comment`|Python ignores the whole line|
|Inline comment|`a = 5 # Set a to 5`|Must come **after** valid code|
|Invalid comment|`a = # 5`|‚ùå Not allowed in the middle of a line|
|Toggle comment|`Ctrl + /`|Shortcut to comment/uncomment|
