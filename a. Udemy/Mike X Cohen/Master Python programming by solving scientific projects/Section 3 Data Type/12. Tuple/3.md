### ✅ Part 3: **Tuple Behavior and Function Overloading**

---

#### 🔁 **Tuples with Operators**

Just like lists, tuples support **some operators** — especially the multiplication operator:

```python
a_tuple = (3, 4, 3)
print(a_tuple * 2)
```

**Output:**

```
(3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3)
```

- The `* 2` operator **repeats the tuple**.
    
- This behavior is the **same** as with lists.

#### 🧪 **Tuples Have Methods Too**

Tuples support a few **built-in methods**, although fewer than lists.

Example using `.count()`:

```python
a_tuple = (3, 4, 3)
print(a_tuple.count(3))
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

- `.count(value)` returns the **number of times** that value appears in the tuple.
    
- In this case, `3` appears **twice**, so the result is `2`.

#### ⚠️ **Reminder: Still Looks Like a List**

Although tuples behave similarly to lists:

- You can repeat them with `*`
    
- You can call some methods on them like `.count()`
    

You **still haven’t reached** the main difference — that’s coming in Part 4.

#### ✅ Summary

|Feature|Tuple Behavior|
|---|---|
|Repetition|`a_tuple * 2` repeats the tuple|
|Method `.count()`|Counts how many times a value appears|
|Similarity|Behaves just like a list — _so far!_|
