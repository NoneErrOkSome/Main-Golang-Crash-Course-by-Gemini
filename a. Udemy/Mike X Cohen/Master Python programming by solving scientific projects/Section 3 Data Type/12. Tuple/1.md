### ✅ Part 1: **Pronunciation and Overview of Tuples**

---

#### 🗣️ **How do you pronounce "tuple"?**

There are **two common pronunciations** for the word:

- **"too-pul"** — rhymes with "pupil"
    
- **"tuh-pul"** — rhymes with "supple"
    

Both are acceptable, and people in different regions or backgrounds may prefer one over the other.

> ✅ The speaker prefers **"too-pul"** because it "sounds nicer" and feels more natural than "tuh-pul."
