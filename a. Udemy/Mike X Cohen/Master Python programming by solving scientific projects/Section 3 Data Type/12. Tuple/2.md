### ✅ Part 2: **Creating Tuples vs. Lists**

---

#### 🧱 **What’s the difference in syntax?**

**Lists** in Python are created using **square brackets**:

```python
a_list = [3, 4, 3]
```

- This is a list because it uses `[ ]`.
    
- It can contain any number of items, including duplicates.
    

---

**Tuples** are created using **parentheses**:

```python
a_tuple = (3, 4, 3)
```

- This is a tuple because it uses `( )`.
    
- It looks very similar to a list when printed.

#### 🖨️ **Printing the Tuple**

```python
print(a_tuple)
```

Output:

```
(3, 4, 3)
```

- The only visible difference from a list is that a tuple uses **parentheses** instead of square brackets.
    
- This is why tuples and lists are often confused.

#### 🔄 **Same Symbol, Different Use (Overloading)**

- In Python, **parentheses `()`** are also used to call functions:
    
    ```python
    print("Hello")  # Function call
    ```
    
- Now, the same parentheses are used to define tuples:
    
    ```python
    (3, 4, 3)  # Tuple
    ```
    
- This is called **overloading** — reusing symbols for multiple meanings depending on context.

#### ✅ Summary

|Type|Syntax|Example|
|---|---|---|
|List|Square brackets `[ ]`|`[3, 4, 3]`|
|Tuple|Parentheses `( )`|`(3, 4, 3)`|

|Concept|Key Point|
|---|---|
|Appearance|Tuples and lists look very similar when printed|
|Symbol use|Parentheses are reused for both tuples and functions|
