### ✅ Part 4: **Mutability — The Key Difference**

---

#### 🔁 **Mutability vs. Immutability**

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Mutable**|Can be **changed** after it's created|
|**Immutable**|Cannot be changed after it's created|

- **Lists** are mutable.
    
- **Tuples** are immutable.
    

---

#### 🧪 **Lists Can Be Modified**

```python
a_list = [3, 4, 3]
a_list[0] = 5
print(a_list)
```

**Output:**

```
[5, 4, 3]
```

- We changed the **first element** of the list from `3` to `5`.
    
- This is called **indexing**, and lists allow it.
    

📌 In Python, **indexing starts at 0**, so:

- `a_list[0]` → first element
    
- `a_list[1]` → second element
    
- etc.
    

---

#### 🚫 **Tuples Cannot Be Modified**

```python
a_tuple = (3, 4, 3)
a_tuple[0] = 5  # ❌ This causes an error
```

**Error message:**

```
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

- This means you **cannot reassign** an individual item in a tuple.
    
- Tuples are **locked** after creation.
    

---

#### 🔁 **You _Can_ Replace the Whole Tuple**

```python
a_tuple = (3, 4, 3)
a_tuple = (5, 4, 3)  # ✅ This is allowed
```

- You can reassign the **entire tuple** to a new value.
    
- But you **cannot modify** elements _inside_ the existing tuple.
    

---

#### ✅ Summary

|Operation|List|Tuple|
|---|---|---|
|Modify single element|✅|❌|
|Reassign entire variable|✅|✅|
|Default behavior|Mutable|Immutable|

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Mutable|Changeable after creation — like a list|
|Immutable|Locked after creation — like a tuple|
