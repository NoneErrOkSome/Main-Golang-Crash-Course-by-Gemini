### 🧪 Part 5: Program Testing with Known Values

---

#### 🎯 **Goal:**

Test the program using **known correct answers** to ensure your calculations are working properly.

---

### ✅ Use Pythagorean Triplets

**Pythagorean triplets** are sets of whole numbers that satisfy:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

Common examples:

- $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$ → $9 + 16 = 25$
    
- $5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2$ → $25 + 144 = 169$
    
- $8^2 + 15^2 = 17^2$ → $64 + 225 = 289$

### 🔍 Why Use Known Values?

Because if you **know the correct result**, you can quickly tell whether your code is working or not.

If you enter:

```text
Enter the length of side A: 3  
Enter the length of side B: 4  
```

And get:

```text
The length of side C is 5.0
```

Then you know:

$$ \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $$

✅ **Correct output!**

### 🧪 Try Another Example

Inputs:

```text
Enter the length of side A: 6  
Enter the length of side B: 8  
```

Calculation:

$$ \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64} = \sqrt{100} = 10 $$

So you should get:

```text
The length of side C is 10.0
```

---

### 🧹 Optional: Add Line Breaks for Clean Output

You can add:

```python
print()
```

before the final output to leave a blank line and make it more readable.
