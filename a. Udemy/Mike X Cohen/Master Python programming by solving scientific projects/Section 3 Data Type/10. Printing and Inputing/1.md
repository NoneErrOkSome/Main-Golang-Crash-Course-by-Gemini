### 🧮 Part 1: Basic Expression Construction and Concatenation

---

#### 🎯 **Goal:**

Print an arithmetic expression like this:

**"3 times 5 equals 15"**

But instead of writing the full sentence manually, we use **variables** to make it dynamic.

---

#### 🔢 **Step-by-step Explanation:**

Let’s say you define two numbers:

```python
x = 3
y = 5
```

You want to print a sentence that uses the **values** of `x` and `y`, and also shows the result of their multiplication.

If you try this:

```python
print(x + " times " + y + " equals " + x * y)
```

You’ll get an **error**, because Python doesn’t know how to add an integer (`x`) and a string (`" times "`).

---

#### ✅ **Solution: Use `str()` to convert integers into strings**

```python
print(str(x) + " times " + str(y) + " equals " + str(x * y))
```

This works because now everything being concatenated is a **string**.

---

#### 📐 **Math expression behind the code**

You are printing the equation:

$$ x \times y = x \cdot y $$

When:

- $x = 3$
    
- $y = 5$
    
- $x \cdot y = 15$
    

So the final result is:

$$ 3 \times 5 = 15 $$

But in code, it becomes:

```python
print(str(x) + " times " + str(y) + " equals " + str(x * y))
```

---

#### 🧪 Example Output:

If `x = 8` and `y = 5`, this line:

```python
print(str(x) + " times " + str(y) + " equals " + str(x * y))
```

will output:

**"8 times 5 equals 40"**
