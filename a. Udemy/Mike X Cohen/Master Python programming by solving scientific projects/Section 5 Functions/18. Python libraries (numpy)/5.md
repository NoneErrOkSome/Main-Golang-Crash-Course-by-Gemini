# 🔹 Part 5: Converting Lists to NumPy Arrays

## 🎯 Why Convert a List to a NumPy Array?

Python **lists** are flexible but **limited** for mathematical operations.

NumPy **arrays** (type: `ndarray`) are designed for **numeric computing**.

Benefits of NumPy arrays:

- Support **element-wise operations**
    
- Work with **functions** like `np.mean()`, `np.min()`, etc.
    
- Enable **matrix operations** and **multi-dimensional data**

## 🧪 How to Convert a List to a NumPy Array

Given a standard list:

```python
number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Convert to a NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np

number_np = np.array(number)
```

---

## 🔍 Check the Type

```python
print(type(number))      # <class 'list'>
print(type(number_np))   # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

✅ This confirms the transformation from list to array.

## 👁️ What Do They Look Like?

```python
print(number)      # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(number_np)   # [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

- **Lists** show elements separated by **commas**
    
- **NumPy arrays** display them with **spaces**
    

They look similar, but behave **very differently**.

## 📘 Why It Matters

NumPy arrays allow:

```python
number_np * 2
# Output: [ 2  4  6  8 10 12 ]  ✅ element-wise multiplication
```

But Python lists behave differently:

```python
number * 2
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  ❌ list repetition
```

> The exact same syntax has **very different behavior** depending on the data type.

## 🧠 Summary

|Feature|Python List|NumPy Array|
|---|---|---|
|Type|`list`|`numpy.ndarray`|
|Multiply by 2|Repeats list|Multiplies each element|
|Format|`[1, 2, 3]`|`[1 2 3]`|
|Created by|Literal `[]`|`np.array(list)`|
|Supports NumPy funcs|Limited|Full access to NumPy methods|
