# 🔹 Part 2: Importing NumPy and Using Aliases

---

## 📦 What Is NumPy?

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is one of the **most important modules** in scientific computing.

It provides:

- Fast, memory-efficient **n-dimensional arrays**
    
- Math functions like `mean()`, `std()`, `sum()`
    
- Tools for linear algebra, random number generation, and more
    

You must **import it first** before using any of its functions.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Basic Import

```python
import numpy
```

This loads the **entire NumPy module** into your Python session.

You can now access functions using the module name + dot:

```python
numpy.mean([10, 20, 30])  # Output: 20.0
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistake

Trying to use `numpy.mean(...)` **before importing** the module will give:

```
NameError: name 'numpy' is not defined
```

This means: Python doesn't know what "numpy" is — you must import it first.

---

## ✍️ Step 2: Using an Alias with `as`

Typing `numpy` over and over again can feel long.

Python allows **aliases** for modules using the `as` keyword:

```python
import numpy as np
```

Now you can write:

```python
np.mean([10, 20, 30])  # Output: 20.0
```

✅ Same result, but shorter and easier to read.

---

## 📘 Why Use `np`?

- **`np` is the universal convention** for NumPy
    
- All Python courses, textbooks, and libraries use it
    
- Makes your code easier for others to read
    

> Even if you don’t mind typing `numpy`, it’s good practice to use `import numpy as np`.

---

## 🔁 How Often Do You Need to Run `import`?

Only **once per session**.

### Example:

```python
import numpy as np  # run once

x = np.mean([1, 2, 3])  # now you can call np functions freely
```

---

## 🔄 Restarting the Kernel

If you **restart your Python environment**, you must re-run the import.

In Jupyter or Colab:

1. Click **Runtime > Restart Runtime**
    
2. Then run your import again:
    

```python
import numpy as np
```

Otherwise, you’ll see `NameError` again because the module is no longer loaded.

---

## 📋 Best Practice: Put Imports at the Top

All imports should go at the **very top of your script or notebook**:

```python
# ✅ Good style — top of script
import numpy as np

my_list = [10, 20, 30]
avg = np.mean(my_list)
```

---

## 🧠 Summary Table

|Task|Syntax|
|---|---|
|Basic import|`import numpy`|
|Import with alias|`import numpy as np`|
|Call function with full name|`numpy.mean([1,2,3])`|
|Call function with alias|`np.mean([1,2,3])`|
|After restart: re-import|`import numpy as np` again|
|Best practice|Put imports at the top|
