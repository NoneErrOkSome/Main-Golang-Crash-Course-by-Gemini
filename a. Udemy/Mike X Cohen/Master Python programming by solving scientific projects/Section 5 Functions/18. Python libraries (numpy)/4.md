# 🔹 Part 4: Intro to `np.linspace()` and Generating Arrays

---

## 🎯 What Is `np.linspace()`?

`np.linspace()` is a **NumPy function** used to generate **evenly spaced numbers** over a specified interval.

It’s incredibly useful when you need to:

- Create **smooth intervals**
    
- Generate values for **plotting**
    
- Simulate **continuous data** across a range
    

---

## ✅ Syntax

```python
np.linspace(start, stop, num)
```

- **start**: beginning of the range
    
- **stop**: end of the range (inclusive)
    
- **num**: how many points to generate

## 📦 Example from Transcript

```python
np.linspace(1, 8, 20)
```

- This generates **20 numbers** between `1` and `8`, **evenly spaced**.
    
- Output (visually condensed):
    
    ```
    [1.         1.368...  ... 7.631... 8.        ]
    ```
    

You don’t have to count them manually.  
The transcript mentions:

> "There are 4 rows and 5 columns, so yep, that's 20 numbers."

That’s because Jupyter or Colab **auto-formats** the output into a grid.

## 📊 Changing the Range and Density

Want more numbers?

```python
np.linspace(1, 80, 20)
```

This gives 20 numbers from `1` to `80`, spaced farther apart.

## 🔍 Use Cases

|Use Case|Why Use `linspace()`|
|---|---|
|Graphing / Plotting|Generate x-axis or y-axis points|
|Simulations|Divide a range into small intervals|
|Data preparation|Create continuous input variables|

---

## ✅ Bonus: Confirm Count with `len()`

```python
arr = np.linspace(1, 8, 20)
print(len(arr))  # Output: 20
```
