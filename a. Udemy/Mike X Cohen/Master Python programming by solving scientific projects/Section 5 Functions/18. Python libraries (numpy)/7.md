# 🔹 Part 7: Mutation, Reassignment, and Type Conversion

---

## 🧠 What Is Mutation?

**Mutation** means a variable is **modified in-place** — without needing to reassign it.

In Python, this can happen with:

- **Lists**
    
- Some **methods**
    
- Certain **NumPy operations**
    

---

## 🧪 Example: Sorting a Python List with `.sort()`

```python
n = [3, 1, 5, 2]
print(n)  # [3, 1, 5, 2]

n.sort()  # Sorts in-place
print(n)  # [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

- `.sort()` doesn’t return a value.
    
- It **mutates** `n` in-place.
    
- `n` is now sorted permanently.
    

> ⚠️ No reassignment needed: `n = n.sort()` ❌ is incorrect.

---

## ✅ Contrast: NumPy `np.sort()` Returns a New Array

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([3, 1, 5, 2])
sorted_arr = np.sort(arr)

print(arr)         # [3 1 5 2] (unchanged)
print(sorted_arr)  # [1 2 3 5] (new array)
```

- `np.sort()` **does NOT mutate** the input
    
- Instead, it returns a **new sorted array**
    
- Use `sorted_arr = np.sort(arr)` to capture the result

## 🔁 Method vs Function Behavior

|Action|Python List|NumPy Array|
|---|---|---|
|`.sort()`|Mutates in-place|Not available|
|`np.sort(array)`|New sorted result|Returns new array|

---

## ⚠️ Pitfall: Losing Synchronization Between Paired Data

> If you're working with multiple lists or arrays, and you **sort one but not the others**, they will become **out of sync**.

Always track **whether you're mutating** a variable or creating a new one.

---

## 🔄 Function Output Can Change Data Type

### Example:

```python
n = [4, 2, 6, 1]
print(type(n))  # <class 'list'>

n = np.sort(n)
print(type(n))  # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

- Before sorting: `n` is a **list**
    
- After `np.sort()`: `n` becomes a **NumPy array**
    
- This change happens silently, unless you're watching
    

---

## 🔙 Convert Back to List (if needed)

```python
n = list(n)
print(type(n))  # <class 'list'>
```

✅ Converts any iterable (like an array) **back into a list**.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|`.sort()` on list|Mutates in-place (no output)|
|`np.sort()` on array|Returns a new sorted array|
|Reassignment|Captures function output into a variable|
|Output can change type|e.g. list → ndarray|
|Convert array → list|Use `list(array)`|
|Beware of in-place mutation|Can break synchronization in paired data|
