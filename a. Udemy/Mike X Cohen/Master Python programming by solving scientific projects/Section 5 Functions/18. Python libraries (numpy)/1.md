# 🔹 Part 1: Why `mean()` Isn’t Built-In and Intro to Modules

---

## ❓ Why Doesn’t `mean()` Work Out of the Box?

When you try:

```python
mean([10, 20, 30])
```

or:

```python
average([10, 20, 30])
```

you get this error:

```
NameError: name 'mean' is not defined
```

Even though calculating the average seems basic, Python gives you an error.

## 🧠 Why No Built-In `mean()`?

- Python’s **base environment** is intentionally **minimal**.
    
- It only includes **core functionality** for simplicity and speed.
    
- Many useful features (like `mean`) are available through **external modules**, not built-in.

## 🧰 The Python Philosophy

> Keep the base lightweight.  
> Use external **modules** (aka libraries or packages) for more advanced features.

This modular approach helps keep Python:

- Faster to load
    
- Easier to extend
    
- Cleaner to maintain

## 🔧 The Solution: Use a Module

Python gives access to additional functionality through **modules**.

You import them using the `import` statement:

```python
import numpy
```

Then access the `mean()` function like this:

```python
numpy.mean([10, 20, 30])  # Output: 20.0
```

✅ Now it works — because `mean()` is part of the **NumPy** module.

## 🧠 What Is a Module?

A **module** is a file or package that contains:

- Functions
    
- Constants
    
- Tools
    
- Data structures
    

Examples of common modules:

- `math` – mathematical functions
    
- `random` – random number tools
    
- `numpy` – numerical computing (arrays, math, stats)
