# üîπ Part 6: Methods on Arrays vs. Functions in Modules

---

## üß† Two Ways to Do the Same Thing

In Python, especially with NumPy, you‚Äôll often see **two ways to perform the same operation**:

### ‚úÖ 1. **Module Function** (standalone)

```python
np.min(array)
np.max(array)
```

### ‚úÖ 2. **Object Method** (dot syntax)

```python
array.min()
array.max()
```

Both return the **same result**, but they reflect **two different styles** of function usage in Python.

---

## üìò What‚Äôs the Difference?

|Style|Called As|Concept|
|---|---|---|
|Function|`np.min(array)`|Regular function from a module|
|Method|`array.min()`|Function that belongs to the object|

- A **function** is independent and takes the array as input.
    
- A **method** is **bound to the object** (e.g., a NumPy array), and is called with dot syntax.
    

---

## üß™ Example from the Transcript

```python
number_np = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

print(number_np.min())       # 1
print(np.min(number_np))     # 1

print(number_np.max())       # 6
print(np.max(number_np))     # 6
```

‚úÖ Both methods work ‚Äî choose based on style or preference.

---

## üí° Method = A Function Attached to an Object

You can think of a **method** as:

> A function that lives inside an object and can only be called through that object.

Example:

```python
array.sum()  # method
```

Is different in structure from:

```python
np.sum(array)  # function
```

But not always in behavior ‚Äî both often return the same value.

---

## üß∞ List of Available Methods

Typing:

```python
number_np.<TAB>
```

in Jupyter or Colab shows all available methods for a NumPy array.

E.g.:

- `min()`
    
- `max()`
    
- `mean()`
    
- `reshape()`
    
- `sum()`
    
- and more...

## üîç When Does This Matter?

Some methods:

- **Return values** without changing anything
    
- Others may **change the object in place** (covered more in Part 7)
    

So it's useful to know **what you're calling**, especially when working with objects like arrays, lists, or DataFrames.

---

## üß† Summary

|Category|Example|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|Module Function|`np.max(arr)`|Any array, universal style|
|Object Method|`arr.max()`|Tied directly to the object|
|Same result?|Often, yes|Choose whichever is readable|
