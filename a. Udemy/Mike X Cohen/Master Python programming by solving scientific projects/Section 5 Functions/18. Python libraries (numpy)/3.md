# 🔹 Part 3: Using NumPy’s `mean()` Function

---

## 🧠 Recap: Why This Matters

In the previous parts, we learned that Python doesn’t include a `mean()` function by default.  
You must use the `mean()` function provided by **NumPy**, a module for numerical operations.

---

## ✅ How to Use `np.mean()`

After importing NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
```

You can now calculate the average (mean) of a list using:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
avg = np.mean(my_list)
print(avg)  # Output: 20.0
```

- `np.mean()` takes a **list** or **NumPy array** as input
    
- It returns the **average** (arithmetic mean)
    

---

## 🧪 Why Use `np.mean()` Instead of Manual Average?

Manually computing the average:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
avg = sum(my_list) / len(my_list)
```

Using NumPy:

```python
avg = np.mean(my_list)
```

Both are correct, but `np.mean()`:

- Is **cleaner**
    
- Works on **NumPy arrays**
    
- Handles **large and multidimensional datasets**
    
- Is part of standard scientific Python workflows
    

---

## 🔎 Inside the `mean()` Function

```python
np.mean([10, 20, 30])
```

What happens internally:

- Adds up all numbers: `10 + 20 + 30 = 60`
    
- Divides by the number of elements: `60 / 3 = 20.0`
    
- Returns a **float** result
    

---

## 🔁 Works With More Than Lists

You can also pass in a **NumPy array**:

```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30])
np.mean(arr)  # Output: 20.0
```

And it works the same way.

---

## 📌 What If You Forget to Import?

If you write:

```python
np.mean([10, 20, 30])
```

without importing NumPy first, you’ll get:

```
NameError: name 'np' is not defined
```

To fix it, always start your script with:

```python
import numpy as np
```

---

## 💡 Printing Results

To display the result, use:

```python
print(np.mean([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: 20.0
```

or store it in a variable:

```python
avg = np.mean([10, 20, 30])
print(avg)
```

## 🧠 Summary

|Task|Syntax|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Import NumPy|`import numpy as np`|—|
|Calculate average|`np.mean([10, 20, 30])`|`20.0`|
|Store result|`avg = np.mean(my_list)`|`avg = 20.0`|
|Without import|❌ `NameError`||
