This video explains how to create your own custom functions in Python, why you'd want to, and introduces a concise way to define simple functions using `lambda`.

## Why Create Your Own Functions? ü§î

While Python has many built-in functions and countless more in external modules (like NumPy and Pandas), you'll often encounter situations where:

- A specific function you need doesn't exist.
- An existing function is too complex for your specific, simpler use case, and you could write a more efficient version yourself.

Custom functions are defined within your own code and can be called from other parts of that code.

---

## Defining a Basic Function üõ†Ô∏è

Creating a function is straightforward:

1. Use the `def` keyword (which stands for "define").
2. Follow it with your chosen **function name** (e.g., `awesome_function`).
3. Add **parentheses** `()`.
4. End the line with a **colon** `:`.
5. The lines of code that make up the function body must be **indented** underneath the `def` line.



```Python
# Define a simple function
def awesome_function():
    # This function will print the result of 1 + 1
    print(1 + 1)

# At this point, the function is defined, but nothing has happened yet.
# To make it do something, we need to "call" it.
```

---

## Calling a Function üìû

Defining a function doesn't run it. To execute the function, you must **call** it by its name followed by parentheses.



```Python
def awesome_function():
    print(1 + 1)

# This just tells you what 'awesome_function' is (an object of type function)
print(awesome_function)

# This actually calls (runs) the function
awesome_function() # Output: 2
```

---

## Functions with Inputs and Outputs üì•üì§

Functions become much more powerful when they can take **inputs** (also called arguments or parameters) and produce **outputs** (return values).

- **Inputs** are defined as variable names inside the parentheses in the function definition.
- **Outputs** are specified using the `return` keyword.



```Python
def super_awesome_function(input1, input2):
    # This function takes two inputs and returns their sum.
    result = input1 + input2
    return result

# Calling the function with inputs
sum_result = super_awesome_function(4, 8)
print(f"The sum is: {sum_result}") # Output: The sum is: 12

sum_result_2 = super_awesome_function(1, 1)
print(f"Another sum is: {sum_result_2}") # Output: Another sum is: 2

# If you call a function that expects inputs without providing them, you'll get an error:
# super_awesome_function() # This would raise a TypeError: missing 2 required positional arguments
```

print vs. return:

It's crucial to understand the difference:

- `print()` inside a function displays a value to the console but doesn't make that value the function's output. If a function doesn't have an explicit `return` statement, it implicitly returns `None`.
- `return` sends a value back from the function, which can then be assigned to a variable or used in further computations.



```Python
def function_that_prints():
    print("Hello from print function!")
    # No explicit return, so it returns None

def function_that_returns():
    return "Hello from return function!"

output_from_print = function_that_prints() # "Hello from print function!" is printed
print(f"Output from function_that_prints: {output_from_print}") # Output: Output from function_that_prints: None

output_from_return = function_that_returns() # Nothing is printed by the function call itself
print(f"Output from function_that_returns: {output_from_return}") # Output: Output from function_that_returns: Hello from return function!
```

---

## Functions Returning Multiple Outputs üéÅüéÅ

A function can return multiple values. You list them after the `return` keyword, separated by commas.



```Python
def my_fun_fun(in1, in2):
    sum_result = in1 + in2
    prod_result = in1 * in2
    print(f"Their sum is: {sum_result}")
    print(f"Their product is: {prod_result}")
    return sum_result, prod_result # Returning two values

# Calling the function
results_tuple = my_fun_fun(4, 4)
# Console output from prints inside function:
# Their sum is: 8
# Their product is: 16

print(f"Type of results_tuple: {type(results_tuple)}") # Output: Type of results_tuple: <class 'tuple'>
print(f"Content of results_tuple: {results_tuple}")    # Output: Content of results_tuple: (8, 16)

# You can access individual elements from the tuple
print(f"First element (sum): {results_tuple[0]}")     # Output: First element (sum): 8
print(f"Second element (product): {results_tuple[1]}") # Output: Second element (product): 16

# Alternatively, you can unpack the returned tuple directly into multiple variables:
out_s, out_p = my_fun_fun(5, 3)
# Console output from prints inside function:
# Their sum is: 8
# Their product is: 15
print(f"Sum output variable: {out_s}")     # Output: Sum output variable: 8
print(f"Product output variable: {out_p}") # Output: Product output variable: 15
```

If you assign the multiple return values to a single variable, that variable becomes a **tuple** containing all the returned values. If you provide multiple variables on the left side of the assignment (matching the number of returned values), each variable receives one of the outputs.

## Function Scope and Persistence ‚è≥

- Functions you define exist for the duration of your current Python **session**.
- If you **restart your Python runtime** or kernel (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook or Colab), all defined variables and functions are lost.
- You need to **re-run the cell containing the function definition** to make the function available again in a new session or after a restart.



```Python
def temporary_function():
    print("I exist for this session!")

temporary_function()

# If you restart the Python runtime now and try to call temporary_function() again
# without re-running its definition, you'll get a NameError: name 'temporary_function' is not defined.
```

## Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions) –∫–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–∫–æ

Lambda functions provide a concise way to create small, **anonymous** (unnamed, though often assigned to a variable) functions. They are typically **one-liners**.

The syntax is: `lambda arguments: expression`

- The `expression` is implicitly returned.



```Python
# A regular function
def square_minus_one_def(x):
    return x**2 - 1

# Equivalent lambda function
little_fun = lambda x: x**2 - 1

print(f"Using def: {square_minus_one_def(4)}") # Output: Using def: 15
print(f"Using lambda: {little_fun(4)}")     # Output: Using lambda: 15

# Lambda functions cannot span multiple lines for their logic.
# If your function needs more than one line of expression or is complex, use a regular 'def' function.
```

Lambda functions are often used for simple operations where a full function definition would be overly verbose, such as an argument to higher-order functions like `map()` or `filter()`.

## Exercise: Factorial Function üßÆ

The video includes an exercise to:

1. Create a function using `def` that computes the factorial of an integer.
    - _Factorial definition_: n!=n√ó(n‚àí1)√ó(n‚àí2)√ó‚ãØ√ó1. For example, 5!=5√ó4√ó3√ó2√ó1=120.
    - (Note: 0! is defined as 1).
2. Compare its output with the `math.factorial()` function from Python's `math` module.

**Solution from the video:**



```Python
import numpy as np # NumPy is used for np.prod and np.arange
import math        # For the built-in factorial function

def my_factorial(val):
    """Computes the factorial of an integer val."""
    if val < 0:
        return "Factorial not defined for negative numbers"
    if val == 0:
        return 1
    # np.arange(1, val + 1) creates an array from 1 up to val (inclusive)
    # np.prod() computes the product of all elements in the array
    return np.prod(np.arange(1, val + 1, dtype=np.int64)) # Using int64 for larger numbers

# Test the custom factorial function
print(f"my_factorial(5): {my_factorial(5)}")   # Output: my_factorial(5): 120
print(f"my_factorial(1): {my_factorial(1)}")   # Output: my_factorial(1): 1
print(f"my_factorial(0): {my_factorial(0)}")   # Output: my_factorial(0): 1 (as per my added base case)
print(f"my_factorial(4): {my_factorial(4)}")   # Output: my_factorial(4): 24

# Compare with math.factorial
k = 5
print(f"\nFor k = {k}:")
print(f"math.factorial(k): {math.factorial(k)}")
print(f"my_factorial(k):   {my_factorial(k)}")

k = 15
print(f"\nFor k = {k}:")
print(f"math.factorial(k): {math.factorial(k)}")
print(f"my_factorial(k):   {my_factorial(k)}")

# The video notes a discrepancy for larger numbers like 23.
# This happens because np.prod on standard NumPy integer types can overflow
# sooner than Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integers used by math.factorial.
# Using dtype=np.int64 or np.object_ in np.arange can help np.prod handle larger numbers,
# but math.factorial is generally more robust for very large integer factorials.

k = 20 # np.int32 would overflow here, np.int64 is fine for a bit longer
print(f"\nFor k = {k}:")
print(f"math.factorial(k): {math.factorial(k)}")
print(f"my_factorial(k):   {my_factorial(k)}")

# The video mentions that if writing a function for others, input validation
# (e.g., ensuring the input is a non-negative integer) would be important.
```

The video points out that for very large numbers (e.g., 23!), the custom `my_factorial` using `np.prod` might give a different (incorrect due to overflow or precision issues with standard NumPy integer types) result compared to `math.factorial`. `math.factorial` is designed to handle arbitrarily large integers, while NumPy arrays have fixed-size integer types by default which can overflow. Using `dtype=np.int64` or `dtype=object` in `np.arange` can extend the range for `np.prod` but `math.factorial` remains more specialized for this task.

This introduction covers the basics of creating and using your own functions in Python, a fundamental skill for writing more organized, reusable, and complex programs.
