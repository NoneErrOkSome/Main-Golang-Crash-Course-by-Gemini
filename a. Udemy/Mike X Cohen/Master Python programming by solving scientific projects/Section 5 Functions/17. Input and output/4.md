# 🔹 Part 4: Exercise – Compute the Average Using `sum()` and `len()`

---

## 🎯 Task:

You’re given a list of numbers:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
```

Your goal:  
**Compute the average value** using only the built-in functions you've learned so far.

---

## 📐 Formula for Average

$$ \Large \text{average} = \frac{\text{sum of values}}{\text{number of values}} $$

In Python:

```python
avg = sum(my_list) / len(my_list)
```

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Define the list

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
```

---

### 2. Use `sum()` to get the total

```python
total = sum(my_list)   # 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
```

---

### 3. Use `len()` to get the count

```python
count = len(my_list)   # 3 items
```

---

### 4. Compute the average

```python
avg = total / count    # 60 / 3 = 20
```

---

### 5. Print the result

```python
print(avg)  # Output: 20.0
```

---

## 💡 One-Line Solution

```python
avg = sum(my_list) / len(my_list)
```

---

## ✅ Output:

```python
20.0
```

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Step|Function Used|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Add values|`sum(my_list)`|60|
|Count values|`len(my_list)`|3|
|Compute avg|`sum / len`|20.0|
