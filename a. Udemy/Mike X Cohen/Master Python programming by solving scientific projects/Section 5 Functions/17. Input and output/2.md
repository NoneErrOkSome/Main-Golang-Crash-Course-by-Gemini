Absolutely! Since you'd like a deeper focus on **function outputs**, we'll adjust **Part 2** to go beyond just bracket syntax and fully explore **how functions return values** and how to **capture and use** them.

# 🔹 Part 2: Understanding Function Outputs – Returning, Capturing, and Using Results

---

## 🎯 What Is a Function Output?

- A **function output** is the **result** that a function gives you after it processes your input(s).
    
- You can either:
    
    - Use the result **immediately**, or
        
    - **Save** it into a variable for later
        

---

## 🧪 Immediate Use Example

```python
print(sum([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: 60
```

Here, `sum([10, 20, 30])` evaluates to `60`, which is passed directly to `print()`.

---

## 💾 Storing the Output in a Variable

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
total = sum(numbers)

print(total)  # Output: 60
```

- Now the result (`60`) is saved in `total`.
    
- You can reuse it elsewhere without calling `sum()` again.
    

---

## ✅ Syntax Pattern for Capturing Output

```python
output_variable = function_name(input)
```

> Think of the equal sign `=` as "**assign the result of the function to this variable**."

---

## 📦 Using Function Outputs in Math

Function outputs can be used inside other operations:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

print(avg)  # Output: 20.0
```

- `sum(numbers)` → 60
    
- `len(numbers)` → 3
    
- `60 / 3` → 20.0
    

---

## 🔍 Function Outputs Are Values

Just like you can assign `a = 10`, you can assign:

```python
a = len(['a', 'b', 'c'])  # a = 3
b = sum([5, 5, 10])       # b = 20
```

These variables now **store the returned value** of the function — not the function itself.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Concept|Example|
|---|---|
|Call function and store|`x = sum(my_list)`|
|Use result immediately|`print(sum(my_list))`|
|Outputs are values|Can be stored, printed, reused|
|Function output is not the function|`type(sum)` vs `type(sum([1, 2, 3]))`|
