# 🔹 Part 1: Function Basics – Calling Functions and Using Inputs

---

## 🧠 What is a Function?

A **function** in Python is a **reusable block of code** that performs a task.  
You provide it with **input(s)**, and it gives you back an **output**.

---

## 🧪 Example: The `sum()` Function

```python
sum([10, 20, 30])
# Output: 60
```

- `sum()` is a **built-in function**.
    
- It takes **one input**: a list of numbers.
    
- It **returns** their total.
    

---

## ✅ Inputs Must Go Inside Parentheses `()`

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]

sum(my_list)    # ✔️ correct
sum[my_list]    # ❌ error!
```

- **Use `()`** when calling a function
    
- Never use square brackets `[]` — those are for indexing, not calling
    

---

## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistake

```python
sum[my_list]
# TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable
```

- This error happens because you're trying to **index into a function**, which doesn’t make sense.

## 📌 Key Syntax Rule

|Task|Syntax|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Call a function|`()`|`sum([1, 2, 3])`|
|Index a list|`[]`|`my_list[0]`|
