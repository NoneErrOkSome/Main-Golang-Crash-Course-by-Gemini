# 🔹 Part 3: Introducing `len()` and Capturing Outputs

---

## 📏 What Is `len()`?

- `len()` is a **built-in Python function** that returns the **number of items** in a container.
    
- Works with:
    
    - `list`
        
    - `tuple`
        
    - `str`
        
    - `numpy` arrays
        
    - And more...

## 📦 Basic Example with Lists

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]

length = len(my_list)
print(length)  # Output: 3
```

- `len(my_list)` → returns `3` because there are 3 elements.
    
- The result is stored in the variable `length`.

## ✅ Why It Matters

The output of `len()` is just a **regular integer** — you can use it in math:

```python
avg = sum(my_list) / len(my_list)
print(avg)  # Output: 20.0
```

> Here, you're dividing the sum by the length — both are function outputs.

## 🧪 Works with Other Data Types Too

```python
s = "hello"
print(len(s))  # Output: 5

t = (1, 2, 3)
print(len(t))  # Output: 3
```

---

## 📌 Assigning and Using the Output

```python
list_len = len([5, 10, 15])
print("List has", list_len, "items.")
```

- Output: `List has 3 items.`

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Concept|Example|
|---|---|
|`len()` gets count|`len([1, 2, 3]) → 3`|
|Result is an `int`|Can be printed or stored|
|Combine with other functions|`sum(...) / len(...)`|
|Works on strings and tuples|`len("hi") → 2`|
