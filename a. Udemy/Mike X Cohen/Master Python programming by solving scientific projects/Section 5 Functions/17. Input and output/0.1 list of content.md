To clearly cover all the concepts and examples in this transcript, we can divide the content into **4 structured parts**, each focused on a key concept in function usage and good Python syntax habits.

## 🧠 Suggested Breakdown — 4-Part Series on Python Functions (Input, Output, and Syntax)

---

### 🔹 **Part 1: Function Basics – Calling Functions and Using Inputs**

- What is a function
    
- Calling functions with **parentheses**, not square brackets
    
- Common beginner mistake: using `[]` instead of `()` for functions
    
- Example: `sum([10, 20, 30])`
    

---

### 🔹 **Part 2: Indexing vs Function Calls – Brackets Matter**

- Indexing into lists using square brackets `[]`
    
- Accessing elements like `my_list[0]`
    
- Why `sum[my_list]` fails: functions aren’t subscriptable
    
- Clear distinction between:
    
    - `sum(my_list)` ✔
        
    - `my_list[0]` ✔
        
    - `sum[my_list]` ❌

### 🔹 **Part 3: Introducing `len()` and Capturing Outputs from Functions**

- Using `len()` to get number of elements
    
- Assigning function outputs to variables:
    
    ```python
    length = len(my_list)
    ```
    
- Printing stored outputs
    
- Reminder: functions can take 1 or more inputs and **always return outputs**
    

---

### 🔹 **Part 4: Exercise – Compute the Average Using `sum()` and `len()`**

- Problem: Calculate the average of a list
    
- Use previously introduced functions:
    
    ```python
    avg = sum(my_list) / len(my_list)
    ```
    
- Full solution explained with output:
    
    ```python
    print(avg)  # Output: 20
    ```
