### 🧩 Part 6: Using Variables in Slicing

---

So far, we've used **hardcoded numbers** in slicing.  
Now let's take it a step further by using **variables** instead.

This makes your code **dynamic**, **flexible**, and **easier to read**.

---

#### 🔹 Defining Slicing Variables

Example:

```python
start = 1
stop  = 4
step  = 2
```

Now use these variables in your slice:

```python
my_list[start:stop:step]
```

Assuming:

```python
my_list = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Result:

```python
[6, 8]
```

Explanation:

- `start = 1` → index 1 = 6 ✅
    
- `step = 2` → skip index 2 (7)
    
- `index 3 = 8` ✅
    
- Stop before index 4 (value 9 ❌)

#### 🔹 Why Use Variables?

- Cleaner code
    
- Easy to reuse and modify
    
- Works great in loops and functions
    

---

#### 🔹 Styling Tip: Align for Readability

✅ This is clear and visually neat:

```python
start = 1
stop  = 4
step  = 2
```

❌ This is harder to read:

```python
start = 1
stop = 4
step=2
```

When variables line up vertically, it makes patterns easier to see — this matters in larger codebases.

#### ✅ Summary for Part 6

- You can store slice indices in variables
    
- Improves code clarity and flexibility
    
- Align variable declarations for better readability
