### ðŸ§© Part 5: Reverse Slicing with Negative Steps

---

In Python, you can use a **negative step** to slice **backward** through a list.

Syntax:

```python
my_list[start:stop:-1]
```

This tells Python to:

- Start from `start`
    
- Move **backward**
    
- Stop _before_ reaching `stop`
    

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Example: Reverse the Entire List

```python
my_list = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
my_list[::-1]
```

Result:

```python
[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]
```

Explanation:

- No start â†’ starts from the end
    
- No stop â†’ goes to the beginning
    
- Step of `-1` â†’ move backward by 1
    

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Example: Reverse a Slice

```python
my_list[4:1:-1]
```

Result:

```python
[9, 8, 7]
```

Breakdown:

- Start at index 4 â†’ value 9
    
- Step back to index 3 â†’ value 8
    
- Step back to index 2 â†’ value 7
    
- Stop _before_ index 1 â†’ value 6 is not included
    

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Use: Descending Order

If a list is sorted in ascending order:

```python
sorted_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Then this will reverse it:

```python
sorted_list[::-1]
# [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Useful for quick reverse without using `.reverse()` or `reversed()`.

#### âœ… Summary for Part 5

- Negative step `-1` walks the list backward
    
- Use `[::-1]` to reverse the entire list
    
- Combine start and stop with `-1` for reversed slices
