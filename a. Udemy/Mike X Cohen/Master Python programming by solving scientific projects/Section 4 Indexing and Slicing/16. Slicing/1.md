### 🧩 Part 1: Introduction to Slicing

#### 🔹 Slicing vs. Indexing

- **Indexing** lets you access a **single element** from a list using its position:
    
    - Example: `my_list[0]` gives you the first element.
        
- **Slicing** is like indexing **on steroids** — it allows you to grab **multiple elements at once** using a **start**, **stop**, and optionally a **step**.

#### 🔹 Creating a List

We begin by creating a list of integers:

```python
my_list = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

This is just a simple list ranging from 5 to 10.

**Indices** for this list are:

|Index|Value|
|---|---|
|0|5|
|1|6|
|2|7|
|3|8|
|4|9|
|5|10|

#### 🔹 Goal of Slicing

You already learned how to access individual elements using indexing:

```python
my_list[0]  # returns 5
```

Now, the question is:  
**How do we access multiple values** like 5 and 6 **at once**?

You might think of doing something like:

```python
my_list[[0, 1]]  # ❌ This doesn't work in basic Python lists
```

That’s where **slicing** comes in.

#### ✅ Summary for Part 1

- Slicing lets you grab **a portion** of a list, not just one item.
    
- You do this with **start:stop** — but stop is **exclusive**.
    
- You cannot use list-of-indices syntax like `my_list[[0, 1]]` for simple lists (that only works in NumPy).
    

In the next part, we’ll dive into the **mechanics** of slicing and what exactly `start:stop` means.
