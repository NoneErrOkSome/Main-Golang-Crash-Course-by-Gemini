### 🧩 Part 2: Detailed Explanation of Basic Slicing

---

#### 🔹 Syntax of Slicing

The basic syntax of slicing is:

```python
my_list[start:stop]
```

- `start`: the index **where slicing begins** (inclusive).
    
- `stop`: the index **where slicing ends** (exclusive — **not included**).
    

---

#### 🔹 Example: Getting 5 and 6

Given the list:

```python
my_list = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Let’s say we want to get the first two elements: `5` and `6`.

These are at index `0` and `1`.

So we slice:

```python
my_list[0:2]
# Result: [5, 6]
```

Why `0:2`?

- Index 0 = 5 ✅
    
- Index 1 = 6 ✅
    
- Index 2 = 7 ❌ (not included!)

#### 🔹 Important Rule

> Python slicing **includes the start**, but **excludes the stop**.

This is true almost everywhere in Python — in loops, ranges, slicing, etc.

---

#### 🔹 Longer Slices

Now try slicing from index `2` to `5`:

```python
my_list[2:5]
# Result: [7, 8, 9]
```

Breakdown:

|Index|Value|Included?|
|---|---|---|
|2|7|✅|
|3|8|✅|
|4|9|✅|
|5|10|❌|

#### 🧠 Visual Rule of Thumb

> **"Up to but not including"** the stop index.

Just imagine a line cutting **between** each element:

```
Index positions:    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
List values:       [5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10]
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
Slice [2:5] cuts:          ↑       ↑
                       Start    Stop (excluded)
```

---

#### ✅ Summary for Part 2

- Use `my_list[start:stop]` to grab a **range of elements**.
    
- **Start is included**, **stop is excluded**.
    
- This design is helpful for zero-based indexing and makes slice lengths predictable:  
    `stop - start == length of slice`.
