### 🧩 Part 3: Slicing Shortcuts

---

Python allows you to **omit** either the start or stop index (or both) when slicing.

This gives you more flexibility and makes the code more concise.

---

#### 🔹 From a Specific Index to the End

```python
my_list[2:]
```

- Starts at index `2`
    
- Goes **to the end** of the list
    

Given:

```python
my_list = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Result:

```python
[7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Because:

- Index 2 = 7
    
- Includes everything from there on
    

---

#### 🔹 From the Beginning to a Specific Index

```python
my_list[:4]
```

- Starts from the **beginning**
    
- Goes **up to (but not including)** index `4`
    

Result:

```python
[5, 6, 7, 8]
```

Because:

- Index 0 = 5 ✅
    
- Index 1 = 6 ✅
    
- Index 2 = 7 ✅
    
- Index 3 = 8 ✅
    
- Index 4 = 9 ❌ (excluded)
    

---

#### 🔹 Entire List

```python
my_list[:]
```

- This returns a **copy of the entire list**
    

Equivalent to:

```python
my_list[0:len(my_list)]
```

Example:

```python
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

---

#### 🔹 Use Case: Cloning a List

```python
copied_list = my_list[:]
```

This creates a **shallow copy** of the original list — useful to avoid modifying the original.

---

#### ✅ Summary for Part 3

- `my_list[start:]`: from start index to the end
    
- `my_list[:stop]`: from beginning up to (not including) stop index
    
- `my_list[:]`: full copy of the list
    

Next, we’ll learn how to **add a third value** to control how slicing skips elements.
