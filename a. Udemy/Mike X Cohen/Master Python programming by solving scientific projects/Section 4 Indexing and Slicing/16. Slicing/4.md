### 🧩 Part 4: Advanced Slicing with Skipping (Step)

---

Slicing has a **third optional parameter**: the **step** (or "skip").

Syntax:

```python
my_list[start:stop:step]
```

- `start`: index to begin
    
- `stop`: index to end (exclusive)
    
- `step`: how much to move forward each time
    

---

#### 🔹 Example: Every Other Element

```python
my_list = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
my_list[0:5:2]
```

Result:

```python
[5, 7, 9]
```

Explanation:

|Index|Value|Included?|
|---|---|---|
|0|5|✅|
|1|6|❌|
|2|7|✅|
|3|8|❌|
|4|9|✅|
|5|10|❌ (stop)|

The step of `2` means **“take every second element.”**

#### 🔹 Changing Step Size

```python
my_list[0:6:3]
```

Result:

```python
[5, 8]
```

Explanation:

- Index 0 = 5 ✅
    
- Skip 1 and 2
    
- Index 3 = 8 ✅
    
- Skip 4 and 5 (stopped)
    

---

#### 🔹 Full Slice with Step

You can also leave out the start and stop, and just specify the step:

```python
my_list[::2]
```

Means:

- From beginning to end
    
- Take every second element
    

Result:

```python
[5, 7, 9]
```

---

#### ✅ Summary for Part 4

- Add `::step` to control how many elements to skip
    
- You can use `start:stop:step` for precise control
    
- Leaving out start/stop lets you easily slice the whole list with skips
