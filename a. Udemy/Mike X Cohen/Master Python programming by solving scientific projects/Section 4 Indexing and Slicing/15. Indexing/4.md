**Part 4: Nested indexing (lists within lists)**

- **Creating mixed-type and nested lists**:
    
    - Lists in Python can contain various data types, including other lists.  
        Example of a mixed-type, nested list:
        
        ```python
        nested_list = [4, 3.5, [1, 9, 4, 5], 2]
        ```
        
    - This list has:
        
        - Integers (`4`, `2`)
            
        - A float (`3.5`)
            
        - Another list (`[1, 9, 4, 5]`) nested inside it
            
- **Accessing nested list elements**:
    
    - To access elements in nested lists, indexing is applied multiple times:
        
    - First, isolate the inner list by indexing its position:
        
        ```python
        nested_list[2]  # Returns [1, 9, 4, 5]
        ```
        
    - Then, apply another index to access elements within the nested list:
        
        ```python
        nested_list[2][2]  # Returns 4
        ```
        
    - Explanation of indexing:
        
        - Outer index `[2]` accesses the third element of the outer list.
            
        - Inner index `[2]` accesses the third element inside that nested list.
            
- **Step-by-step breakdown**:
    
    ```python
    sub_list = nested_list[2]   # sub_list becomes [1, 9, 4, 5]
    element = sub_list[2]       # element becomes 4
    ```
    
    - Python allows direct indexing without intermediate variables:
        
        ```python
        nested_list[2][2]  # Direct access returns 4
        ```

This clearly demonstrates accessing nested lists, highlighting Pythonâ€™s ability to index into multiple layers of structured data.
