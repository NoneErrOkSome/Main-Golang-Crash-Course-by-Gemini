**Part 1: Introduction to indexing and creating a range**

- **Concept of indexing**:
    
    - Indexing is a method to extract specific items from variables like lists, arrays, strings, and many other data types.
        
    - It allows access to individual elements by their position.
        
- **Creating a range**:
    
    - The instructor first creates a variable named `a_range` by using `range(5)`:
        
        ```python
        a_range = range(5)
        ```
        
    - This generates a special Python type called `range`.
        
- **Inspecting the range object**:
    
    - Printing or evaluating `a_range` shows it as a `range` object from 0 to 5, but Pythonâ€™s `range` does **not** include the upper bound (`5`):
        
        ```plaintext
        range(0, 5)
        ```
        
- **Converting a range to a list**:
    
    - To see actual values clearly, convert the `range` object into a list:
        
        ```python
        a_list = list(a_range)
        ```
        
    - The result is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
        
- **Understanding upper bound exclusion**:
    
    - Python almost always treats upper bounds as exclusive, meaning the range stops just before the upper value specified.
        
- **Zero-based indexing explained**:
    
    - Python indexing starts from zero (0):
        
        - Human perspective: `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd` elements.
            
        - Python perspective: `0th`, `1st`, `2nd` elements.
            
    - For example, the number `1` in `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is considered the `1st` element (at index `1`), not the `2nd`.

This covers clearly the **introduction** of indexing, creation of a range, converting it to a list, and understanding how indexing works in Python.
