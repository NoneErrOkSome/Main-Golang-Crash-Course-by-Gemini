**Part 5: Indexing strings and dictionaries (with exercise)**

- **Indexing with strings**:
    
    - Strings can be indexed just like lists:
        
        ```python
        s = "Hello"
        s[0]    # Returns 'H'
        s[3]    # Returns 'l'
        s[-1]   # Returns 'o'
        ```
        
    - Python treats strings as sequences of characters, allowing similar indexing behavior.
        
- **Exercise**:
    
    - The instructor provides a mixed-type list (list containing numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries) as an exercise:
        
        ```python
        list_list = [1, 'hello', [1, 2, 3], 'world', {'penguin': 'yummy', 'lion': 'scary'}]
        ```
        
    - Task:
        
        > Use indexing to retrieve the value associated with `'penguin'` (which is `'yummy'`).
        
- **Step-by-step solution**:
    
    1. First, access the dictionary from the list (`index 4`):
        
        ```python
        list_list[4]  # Returns {'penguin': 'yummy', 'lion': 'scary'}
        ```
        
    2. Then, use dictionary key indexing to access the value `'yummy'` associated with the key `'penguin'`:
        
        ```python
        list_list[4]['penguin']  # Returns 'yummy'
        ```
        
- **Explanation**:
    
    - Accessing a dictionary inside a list is analogous to accessing elements within nested lists:
        
        - First, identify the dictionary’s position in the list.
            
        - Next, use dictionary key indexing (using the dictionary’s key name).

This clearly covers indexing for strings and dictionaries, along with a practical exercise demonstrating combined indexing methods.
