**Part 2: Practical examples of indexing**

- **Extracting single elements**:
    
    - To access an individual element from a list, Python uses square brackets `[]` after the variable name.
        
    - Example list:
        
        ```python
        a_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        ```
        
    - Accessing element at index `1`:
        
        ```python
        a_list[1]  # Returns 1
        ```
        
- **Clarifying indexing with a different range**:
    
    - To avoid confusion, the instructor created another list using a range from `10` to `15`:
        
        ```python
        another_range = range(10, 15)
        another_list = list(another_range)  # [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
        ```
        
    - Accessing index `1` (the second element):
        
        ```python
        another_list[1]  # Returns 11
        ```
        
    - Accessing index `2`:
        
        ```python
        another_list[2]  # Returns 12
        ```
        
- **Further indexing with arbitrary numbers**:
    
    - A more random list was introduced to clearly separate index numbers from their corresponding values:
        
        ```python
        a_list = [5, 5, 4, 1, -2, 0, 3, 2]
        ```
        
    - To get the sixth element (index `5`):
        
        ```python
        a_list[5]  # Returns 0
        ```
        
- **Negative indexing and reverse-order indexing**:
    
    - Python supports negative indexing, which accesses elements from the end of the list backward:
        
        - Last element is at index `-1`.
            
    - Examples:
        
        ```python
        a_list[-1]  # Returns 2 (last element)
        a_list[-3]  # Returns 0 (third-to-last element)
        ```

This clearly illustrates practical indexing examples, including standard and negative indexing, demonstrating indexing flexibility and clarity.
