**Part 3: Indexing using variables and limitations**

- **Using variables as indices**:
    
    - Index numbers can be assigned to variables, making indexing dynamic:
        
        ```python
        idx = 3
        a_list[idx]  # returns element at index 3
        ```
        
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        a_list = [5, 5, 4, 1, -2, 0, 3, 2]
        idx = 3
        a_list[idx]  # Returns 1 (the fourth element)
        ```
        
- **Attempting to index with lists (and limitations)**:
    
    - Attempting to use another list as an index raises a `TypeError`:
        
        ```python
        a_list[[3, 4]]  # Error
        ```
        
    - Error message clearly indicates indexing limitations:
        
        ```plaintext
        TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not list
        ```
        
- **Alternatives and future concepts**:
    
    - Indexing multiple items simultaneously is not straightforward using Python's built-in lists.
        
    - The instructor mentions that this limitation is addressed by **NumPy arrays**, which allow indexing using lists or arrays directly:
        
        - NumPy arrays provide greater flexibility for numerical operations and advanced indexing.

This covers clearly how indexing can be dynamic with variables, the limitations of Pythonâ€™s built-in lists, and briefly introduces a future solution (NumPy arrays).
