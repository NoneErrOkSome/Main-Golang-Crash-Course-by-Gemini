While there aren't a fixed "number" of book types, books are generally categorized by the age group they are intended for, and then further by genre. Here's a breakdown of the common terms used:

## Books by Age Group:

**For Children:**

- **Board Books (Ages 0-3):** These are durable, often made of thick cardboard, with simple stories and bright, colorful illustrations. They are designed for very young children who are just beginning to interact with books.
- **Picture Books (Ages 3-8):** These books use illustrations and text together to tell a story. The pictures are crucial to understanding the narrative. They often introduce basic concepts and life lessons.
- **Early Readers/Easy Readers (Ages 5-8):** These books bridge the gap between picture books and chapter books. They have simple sentences, familiar vocabulary, and some illustrations, designed for children learning to read independently.
- **Chapter Books (Ages 6-10):** These are shorter novels with more text and fewer illustrations than picture books. They introduce children to independent novel reading with engaging protagonists and developing storylines.
- **Middle Grade (MG) Books (Ages 8-12/13):** These are full-length novels with more complex themes, characters, and subplots. The protagonists are typically around 10-13 years old, and the stories often deal with themes like friendship, family, school, and self-discovery.

**For Teenagers:**

- **Young Adult (YA) Books (Ages 12-18):** These books are specifically written for teenagers and often explore themes relevant to adolescence, such as identity, relationships, coming-of-age, and social issues. YA can encompass a wide range of genres, from fantasy and science fiction to realistic fiction and romance.

**For Adults:**

- **New Adult (NA) Books (Ages 18-25):** This category emerged to bridge the gap between YA and adult fiction. NA often focuses on protagonists navigating early adulthood, including college life, first jobs, and serious relationships.
- **Adult Fiction/Non-Fiction:** This is the broadest category, encompassing a vast array of genres for mature readers. There isn't a specific age limit, but the themes, language, and complexity are generally suited for adult sensibilities.

## Common Book Genres (applicable across age groups, with variations in complexity):

Beyond age categories, books are also classified by **genre**, which refers to the style or subject matter of the story. Many genres exist and can often overlap. Some common ones include:
