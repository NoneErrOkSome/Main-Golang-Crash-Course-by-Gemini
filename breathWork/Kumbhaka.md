Of course. The breath-holding techniques you're referring to, known collectively in yogic traditions as _Kumbhaka_ (breath retention), are considered a central component of Pranayama.1 While the broader practice of Pranayama involves the general regulation of life force energy (

_prana_) through breath, Kumbhaka focuses specifically on the pause between inhalation and exhalation.1

The three types of retention you mentioned—holding the breath in, holding it out, and a spontaneous cessation—are believed to produce distinct physiological and psychological effects. Here is a deeper look into each, based on both traditional understanding and modern scientific investigation.

### Antar Kumbhaka: Retention After Inhalation

This is the practice of holding the breath after a full inhalation. Your description of it creating a sense of expansion and increased energy aligns with its proposed physiological mechanism. Scientific analysis suggests that retaining the breath after inhaling increases the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the body.4 This rise in CO2 levels acts as a potent natural vasodilator, meaning it causes blood vessels to widen. This vasodilation can lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow, potentially enhancing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain.4

### Bahya Kumbhaka: Retention After Exhalation

This technique involves holding the breath after a complete exhalation. Your description of this practice creating a sense of emptiness and helping to empty the mind corresponds with its effects on the autonomic nervous system. In contrast to more stimulating breathing exercises that can activate the sympathetic ("fight or flight") system, studies have found that the practice of holding the breath after exhalation increases parasympathetic activity.4 The parasympathetic nervous system governs the body's "rest and digest" response, promoting a state of calm and relaxation.5 This shift toward parasympathetic dominance can help quiet the mind and is often used to prepare for deeper states of meditation.2

### Kevala Kumbhaka: Spontaneous Suspension

This is considered a highly advanced state in Pranayama and is distinct from the effortful retention of Antar or Bahya Kumbhaka. As you noted, it is a state of complete relaxation where the breath seems to suspend itself without any conscious effort to hold it in or out.

In classical yogic texts, this state of spontaneous, complete suspension of breathing is described as the ultimate aim of Pranayama.1 Thinkers and yogis like Theos Bernard and Paramahansa Yogananda have described

_kevala kumbhaka_ as the "gradual cessation of breathing" that can cause the mind to "swoon," leading to a profound meditative state.1 This aligns with the idea that achieving this state of "pure being" is to realize a deep sense of peacefulness and enter a state of pure consciousness, as it represents a point where the regulatory functions of the breath are so balanced that the conscious need to breathe temporarily subsides.1
