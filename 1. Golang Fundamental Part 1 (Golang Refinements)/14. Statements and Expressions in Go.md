## Statements and Expressions in Go 📜✍️

Understanding the distinction between **statements** and **expressions** is fundamental in any programming language, including Go. While the concepts are related, they serve different purposes in constructing a program.

### Expressions

An **expression** in Go is any piece of code that **evaluates to a single value**. Think of an expression as something that, when the Go compiler processes it, produces a result that has a type and a value.

**Common Characteristics of Expressions:**

- **Produce a Value:** The defining feature of an expression is that it yields a result (e.g., a number, a string, a boolean, a struct instance, etc.).
- **Have a Type:** The value produced by an expression always has a specific Go data type.
- **Can Be Part of Other Expressions or Statements:** Expressions can be combined to form larger expressions or used as components within statements.

**Examples of Expressions in Go:**

1. **Literals:** These are direct representations of values.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    42         // An integer literal (evaluates to the value 42, type int)
    3.14159    // A floating-point literal (evaluates to 3.14159, type float64)
    "Hello, Go!" // A string literal
    true       // A boolean literal
    nil        // A nil literal (can be the value for pointers, slices, maps, etc.)
    ```
    
2. **Variables and Constants:** When a variable or constant is used where a value is expected, it acts as an expression, evaluating to the value it holds.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	age := 30            // 'age' in an assignment's right side is part of the expression being assigned
    	fmt.Println(age)     // Here, 'age' is an expression evaluating to 30
    
    	const Pi = 3.14
    	fmt.Println(Pi * 2)  // 'Pi' and '2' are expressions, and 'Pi * 2' is a larger expression
    }
    ```
    
3. **Operators and Operands:** Most operations involving operators form expressions.
    
    - **Arithmetic Expressions:**
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        x := 10 + 5   // 10 + 5 is an expression evaluating to 15
        y := x * 2    // x * 2 is an expression
        ```
        
    - **Comparison Expressions:**
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        isEqual := (x == y)  // (x == y) is an expression evaluating to true or false
        ```
        
    - **Logical Expressions:**
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        canProceed := (age > 18) && (isEqual == false) // This entire right side is an expression
        ```
        
    - **Bitwise Expressions:**
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        result := (1 << 2) | 3 // (1 << 2) | 3 is an expression
        ```
        
4. **Function Calls:** A call to a function that returns one or more values is an expression (or can be part of one). If it returns multiple values, it can be used in contexts that accept multiple values (like multi-value assignment). If used where a single value is expected, only the first return value is typically used (unless it's the sole expression in an assignment).
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import (
    	"fmt"
    	"strings"
    	"math/rand"
    )
    
    func add(a, b int) int {
    	return a + b // a + b is an expression
    }
    
    func main() {
    	sum := add(5, 3) // add(5, 3) is an expression evaluating to 8
    	fmt.Println(sum)
    
    	// strings.ToUpper("hello") is an expression
    	upper := strings.ToUpper("hello")
    	fmt.Println(upper)
    
    	// rand.Intn(10) is an expression
    	fmt.Println(rand.Intn(10) > 5) // rand.Intn(10) > 5 is also an expression
    }
    ```
    
5. **Method Calls:** Similar to function calls, calls to methods that return a value are expressions.
    
6. **Type Conversions:** `T(v)` (e.g., `int(myFloat)`) is an expression that converts `v` to type `T`.
    
7. **Composite Literals:** Used to construct values for slices, arrays, maps, and structs.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    point := struct{X, Y int}{10, 20} // struct{X, Y int}{10, 20} is an expression
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3}           // []int{1, 2, 3} is an expression
    ```
    
8. **Receive Operations from Channels:** `<-myChannel` is an expression that evaluates to the value received from the channel.
    

The key takeaway is that if a piece of code produces a value, it's an expression.

### Statements

A **statement** in Go is a complete unit of execution that performs some action. Programs in Go are sequences of statements. Unlike expressions, statements don't necessarily evaluate to a value (though they often contain expressions).

**Common Characteristics of Statements:**

- **Perform an Action:** Statements instruct the computer to do something (e.g., declare a variable, assign a value, call a function for its side effect, control program flow).
- **Form Complete Units:** A statement is a full instruction.
- **May Contain Expressions:** Many statements include expressions as part of their syntax.

**Examples of Statements in Go:**

1. **Declaration Statements:**
    
    - `var` declarations: `var count int`
    - `const` declarations: `const MaxSize = 100`
    - `type` declarations: `type Point struct { X, Y int }`
    - `func` declarations (function definitions): `func greet() { fmt.Println("Hello") }`
2. **Assignment Statements:**
    
    - Simple assignment: `x = 10`
    - Short variable declaration (which is a statement): `y := 20`
    - Increment and decrement statements: `count++`, `value--` (In Go, these are statements, not expressions that return a value).
3. **Control Flow Statements:** These direct the order of execution.
    
    - `if`/`else if`/`else` statements:
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        if age > 18 { // This whole structure is an if statement
            fmt.Println("Adult")
        }
        ```
        
    - `for` loop statements (all forms: basic for, for-range, while-like for):
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ { // This whole structure is a for statement
            fmt.Println(i)
        }
        ```
        
    - `switch` statements:
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        switch day { // This whole structure is a switch statement
        case "Monday":
            // ...
        }
        ```
        
    - `defer` statements: `defer file.Close()`
    - `go` statements (for goroutines): `go doSomethingConcurrently()`
    - `select` statements (for channels):
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```go
        select {
        case msg := <-ch1:
            // ...
        }
        ```
        
    - `return` statements: `return result`
    - `break` statements: `break`
    - `continue` statements: `continue`
    - `goto` statements: `goto myLabel` (use sparingly)
4. **Expression Statements:** An expression can sometimes be used as a statement if it has a side effect. Most commonly, this is a function call whose return value (if any) is not used.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    fmt.Println("Hello") // fmt.Println("Hello") is an expression (a function call), used here as a statement for its side effect (printing).
    myFunction()         // Calling a function for its side effect.
    ```
    
    However, not all expressions can stand alone as statements. For instance, `x + 5` by itself is an expression, but it's not a valid statement because it doesn't perform an action on its own (it just produces a value that is then discarded).
    
5. Send Statements (for Channels):
    
    myChannel <- value
    
6. **Empty Statement:** A semicolon by itself, which does nothing.

### The Relationship: "Sentences vs. Words"

A useful analogy:

- **Expressions** are like the individual words or phrases in a sentence that have a specific meaning or represent a thing (they produce a value).
- **Statements** are like complete sentences that convey a full instruction or action. A sentence is made up of words and phrases. Similarly, statements often _contain_ expressions.

Consider the statement:

x := 10 + (y * 2)

- `y` is an expression.
- `2` is an expression.
- `y * 2` is an expression.
- `10` is an expression.
- `10 + (y * 2)` is a larger expression that evaluates to a single value.
- `x := 10 + (y * 2)` is a **short variable declaration statement**. It performs the action of declaring `x` and assigning it the value produced by the expression on the right.

---

### Why Does the Distinction Matter?

Understanding the difference is important because Go's syntax expects statements or expressions in different contexts:

- **Control Flow Conditions:** `if` statements, `for` loop conditions, and `switch` expressions expect boolean **expressions**.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```go
    // if myDeclarationStatement { } // Error: if needs a boolean expression, not a statement
    if x > 5 && y < 10 { /* ... */ } // x > 5 && y < 10 is a boolean expression
    ```
    
- **Function Return Values:** A `return` statement can be followed by an **expression** (or a list of expressions for multiple return values).
- **Assignments:** The right-hand side of an assignment (`=` or `:=`) is an **expression**.

---

### Summary

- **Expressions** evaluate to a single value and have a type (e.g., `2+3`, `isActive`, `getUserName()`).
- **Statements** perform an action and form complete units of execution (e.g., `x := 5`, `if x > 0 { ... }`, `myFunctionCall()`).
- Statements often incorporate expressions to determine their behavior or the values they operate on.
- Go's syntax dictates where expressions are required (like in conditions) and where statements make up the structure of the program.

This distinction helps in understanding Go's syntax and how to construct valid and meaningful programs.
