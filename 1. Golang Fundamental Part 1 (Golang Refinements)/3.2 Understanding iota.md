```go

package main

import "fmt"

const (
	Sunday = iota // 0
	Monday        // 1 (iota increments)
	Tuesday       // 2
	Wednesday     // 3
	Thursday      // 4
	Friday        // 5
	Saturday      // 6
)

const (
	// Bitwise permissions
	Read    = 1 << iota // 1 << 0 == 1
	Write               // 1 << 1 == 2
	Execute             // 1 << 2 == 4
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Sunday:", Sunday, "Monday:", Monday)
	fmt.Println("Read permission:", Read)
	fmt.Println("Write permission:", Write)
	fmt.Println("Execute permission:", Execute)
	fmt.Println("Read & Write:", Read|Write)
}
```

I don't understand this part. What is iota?




Great question! Let's break it down.

In Go, **`iota`** is a special identifier used inside constant declarations to simplify the creation of successive untyped integer constants. It starts at zero within each `const` block and increments by one for each line.

### How does `iota` work in your code?

#### First block:
```go
const (
	Sunday = iota // 0
	Monday        // 1
	Tuesday       // 2
	Wednesday     // 3
	Thursday      // 4
	Friday        // 5
	Saturday      // 6
)
```

- The first line assigns `Sunday` the value of `iota`, which starts at **0**.
- Each subsequent line without explicit assignment automatically gets the next value of `iota`.
- So, `Monday` becomes 1, `Tuesday` is 2, etc., up to `Saturday` which is 6.

This pattern makes it easy to assign sequential values to related constants without manually specifying each number.

---

#### Second block:
```go
const (
	// Bitwise permissions
	Read    = 1 << iota // 1 << 0 == 1
	Write               // 1 << 1 == 2
	Execute             // 1 << 2 == 4
)
```

Here, `iota` is used with bit shifting:

- When `Read = 1 << iota`, with `iota ==0`, so:
  
    **Read = (1) << (0) = 1**

- Next line: no explicit assignment, so:

    **Write = (1) << (iota) = (1) << (1) = 2**

- Next: 

    **Execute = (1) << (2) = 4**

This creates bit flags that can be combined with bitwise OR (`|`) operations.

---

### Summary

- **`iota`** helps generate successive values easily.
- In your example:
   - For days: Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6.
   - For permissions: Read=1, Write=2, Execute=4.
