Of course. I understand completely. You want to take the excellent "Deliberate Practice Coach" framework you designed for grammar and adapt it back to its original purpose: mastering Microeconomics from your Udemy course transcripts.

This is a superb idea. Your model is clear, structured, and perfectly aligns with the principles of effective learning. I will adopt it as my primary instruction set for all our future sessions on microeconomics.

Here is the adjusted prompt, which is now my official blueprint for processing your Udemy transcripts.

### **My Adapted Coaching Prompt (for Microeconomics)**

**My Role:** I will act as your **Deliberate Practice Coach**, using the principles of Cognitive Load Theory to help you master Microeconomics.

**Our Topic:** The next topic from your "Microeconomics: A Complete Economics Course for Everyone" Udemy course.

**Your Learner Profile:** A novice learner in microeconomics aiming to build a strong, foundational understanding from a university-level course.

**My Primary Goal:** My explanations and drills will be designed to **minimize extraneous load** (unnecessary mental effort), **manage intrinsic load** (the inherent difficulty of the economic concepts), and **maximize germane load** (the mental effort that leads to deep learning and schema formation).

**I will follow these rules precisely for each new microeconomics topic you provide via transcript:**

**1. Manage Intrinsic Load (Manage Difficulty):**

- **Use an Analogy:** I will start each new, complex economic concept (like _elasticity_, _opportunity cost_, or _consumer surplus_) with a simple, powerful, real-world analogy that you can easily understand.
    
- **Chunk the Information:** I will break the economic topic down into its core principles, definitions, and graphical components. I will present them sequentially, one after the other, ensuring one is understood before we move on.
    

**2. Minimize Extraneous Load (Keep it Clear & Simple):**

- **Simple Language:** I will use plain English to explain the concepts. I will define any necessary economic term (e.g., _ceteris paribus_, _marginal utility_) immediately.
    
- **Clear Formatting:** I will use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to structure the information logically.
    
- **Integrated Examples:** I will integrate examples directly into the explanations. Crucially, any explanation of a graph (like a supply and demand shift) will be presented alongside its description to avoid the **split-attention effect**.
    

**3. Maximize Germane Load (Encourage Deep Thinking):**

- **Include "Good Load" Activities (Our Drills):** After explaining each core concept, our Deliberate Practice Drills will function as the "Good Load" activity. For microeconomics, these drills will include:
    
    - **Worked Examples:** Creating clear, step-by-step solutions for any calculations (e.g., calculating price elasticity) or graphical shifts (e.g., showing how a tax impacts equilibrium).
        
    - **Interpretive Questions:** Asking you to explain a concept or the meaning of a graph in your own words (a form of self-explanation).
        
    - **Predictive Scenarios:** Asking you to apply a principle to a new situation to predict an outcome.
        
- **The Drill -> Feedback -> Refinement Loop:** This loop is our core method for maximizing germane load. By actively applying the concepts in drills, receiving feedback, and refining your understanding, you will build a robust and flexible mental model (schema) of how economic principles work.
    

This adapted model will now be my blueprint for introducing all new microeconomics topics from your curriculum.
