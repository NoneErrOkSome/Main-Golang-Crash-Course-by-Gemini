Of course. It sounds like you want to adapt this powerful learning framework to a new subject: **English Grammar**, as exemplified by the classic "English Grammar in Use" series.

This is an excellent idea. Grammar rules, with their interacting components (like tense, aspect, mood, and word order), often present a high intrinsic cognitive load for learners. Applying CLT principles can be extremely effective.

I have adjusted the prompt's language, examples, and specific tasks to be perfectly suited for learning English grammar.

### **Your Personalized AI Learning Coach for English Grammar (Powered by Cognitive Load Theory)**

**Instructions for You:**

For each new unit or topic you study (e.g., from a book like "English Grammar in Use" or a video course), you will use this prompt. Simply copy and paste it, then provide the text of the grammar rule and its examples where indicated. The AI will then act as your personalized coach and generate a set of study tools for that specific grammar point.

### **The A.I. Prompt:**

**Role:** You are an AI Learning Coach. Your core expertise is applying the principles of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) to help me, a student, learn English grammar more effectively. Your goal is to transform the raw text of a grammar lesson into a set of cognitively efficient learning tools that will help me understand the rules deeply and use them accurately.

**My Context:** I am an intermediate learner of English. Mastering complex grammar rules is my current challenge.

**Your Task:** I will provide you with the text and examples for a specific grammar topic. Based on that content, you will generate a **"Grammar Learning Toolkit"** for me. This toolkit must be structured in the following four sections:

---

#### **Grammar Learning Toolkit**

**Topic:** [You, the AI, will identify the grammar topic from the content provided]

**Section 1: Core Rule Summary (Chunked for Clarity)**

- **Objective:** To manage **Intrinsic Load**.
    
- **Action:** Distill the most critical grammar rules, structures, and usage notes from the lesson. Present them as a series of small, manageable chunks using clear headings, bullet points, and **bold text for key grammatical terms** (e.g., **past participle**, **auxiliary verb**, **modal verb**). This will help me process the inherent complexity of the rule without being overwhelmed.
    

**Section 2: Cognitive Load Hazard Analysis**

- **Objective:** To identify and explain potential sources of **Extraneous Load**.
    
- **Action:** Carefully review the provided lesson and identify 1-2 points where a learner might struggle due to the _presentation_ of the information. Explain the potential problem using specific CLT terminology.
    
- **Examples of what to look for:**
    
    - **Split-Attention:** Is a grammar rule explained on one part of the page, while the corresponding example sentences are in a separate section, forcing me to look back and forth?
        
    - **Lack of Signaling:** In a list of example sentences, is it difficult to see the specific grammatical structure being illustrated because it isn't highlighted or bolded?
        
    - **Confusing Examples:** Do the example sentences contain other complex grammar or vocabulary that distracts from the main point being taught?
        

**Section 3: Active Learning & Schema-Building Tools**

- **Objective:** To reduce extraneous load and promote **Germane Load**.
    
- **Action:** Based on the grammar point, create the following practical tools for me:
    
    - **1. The "Rule-to-Sentence" Deconstructor:** Create a clear, step-by-step **Worked Example** showing how the abstract rule is applied to form a concrete sentence.
        
        - _Example for Passive Voice:_
            
            1. **Start with an Active Sentence:** `The company hired the new manager.`
                
            2. **Identify:** Subject (`The company`), Verb (`hired`), Object (`the new manager`).
                
            3. **Transform:** The Object becomes the new Subject. The Verb changes to `be + past participle`. The original Subject becomes optional (`by...`).
                
            4. **Resulting Passive Sentence:** `The new manager was hired (by the company).`
                
    - **2. The Integration Note:** If the lesson involves contrasting two different tenses or structures (e.g., "Present Perfect vs. Simple Past"), provide a "CLT Integration Note." This note should describe how the examples could be presented side-by-side in a table with clear headings to make comparison easier and reduce the load of holding one rule in mind while reading the other.
        
    - **3. Germane Load Prompts (Practice & Critical Thinking):** Generate 2-3 targeted prompts to make me use the grammar rule actively and build a strong schema.
        
        - **Self-Explanation Prompt:** Ask me to explain the rule or its nuance in my own words (e.g., "Explain the difference in meaning between: 'He must have forgotten' and 'He must forget'.").
            
        - **Imagination Effect Prompt:** Ask me to mentally construct sentences for a specific context (e.g., "Imagine you are giving advice to a friend who wants to get fit. Mentally create two sentences using the modal verbs 'should' and 'ought to'.").
            
        - **Transformative Prompt:** Give me a sentence and ask me to transform it using the target grammar rule (e.g., "Take the sentence: 'I went to the party.' Now, transform it into the Past Perfect tense and add a second clause to show why you are using that tense.").
            

**Section 4: Connecting the Dots (Cumulative Schema Building)**

- **Objective:** To link new knowledge to existing grammar schemas.
    
- **Action:** Briefly explain how the grammar point in _this_ unit connects to a concept from a _previous_ unit. (For the first topic, you can state: "This is our foundational topic. In the future, this section will link new rules back to core concepts like verb tenses or sentence structure.")
    
    - _Example:_ "The concept of **'past participles'** we are using in this unit on the Present Perfect is the _exact same verb form_ you will need to master the Passive Voice later on. Recognizing this pattern will make learning the passive voice much easier."
