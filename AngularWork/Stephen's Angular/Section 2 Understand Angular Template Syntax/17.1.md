That's another great question, and you are correct to ask it. It shows you're thinking carefully about the difference between a general programming concept and a specific feature of a framework.

Just like last time, the phrase **"Tracking Additional Properties" is a descriptive title from your instructor's project, not an official term from the Angular framework.**

Think of it as the title of a chapter in a textbook. The chapter title describes the goal of the lesson, while the content of the chapter teaches you the specific, official techniques to achieve that goal.

### What the Instructor Means by "Tracking Additional Properties"

Based on where you are in the project, this lesson title simply means:

"Let's apply the exact same **'Sync on Change'** pattern we just learned to the rest of the input fields."

The "additional properties" the instructor is referring to are the new variables you need to create in your component class to hold the state of the other inputs, such as:

- `includeNumbers: boolean;`
    
- `includeSymbols: boolean;`
    
- `length: number;`
    

### The Official Angular Tools You Will Use

To accomplish the goal of "Tracking Additional Properties," you will use the same official Angular features we've been discussing:

1. **Component Properties:** You will define new class properties to _store_ the state of each new input.
    
2. **Event Binding `( )`**: You will use `(change)` or `(input)` on the new HTML elements to _listen_ for user actions.
    
3. **Component Methods:** You will write new handler methods in your class to _update_ your new properties when an event occurs.
    

**In short:**

- **The Goal (Instructor's Title):** "Tracking Additional Properties"
    
- **The Tools (Official Angular Features):** Event Binding, Component Properties, and Methods.
    

You are doing a great job distinguishing between the _description of a task_ and the _official name of the tool_ used for that task. That is a critical skill for learning any new technology.
