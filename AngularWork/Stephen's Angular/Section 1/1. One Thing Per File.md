Based on the transcript you provided, the instructor was trying to teach you the fundamental building blocks of an Angular application by explaining the purpose of the core files found in a new project.

Here's a summary of the main learning objectives:

### 1. The Core Principle: "One Thing Per File"

The main reason for the large number of files is that Angular follows a philosophy of **separation of concerns**. Each file is designed to do one specific job, which makes the application easier to manage and scale.

### 2. The Four Key File Types in Angular

The instructor introduced the four most important types of files you will work with, explaining the role of each:

- **Component Template (`.html` file):**
    
    - **What it is:** The visual part of a component.
    - **Its Job:** To define the HTML structure that gets displayed to the user.
    - **Key Detail:** It's not just plain HTML; it uses special **Angular Template Syntax** (like the `(submit)` and `[(ngModel)]` you saw) to add application logic.
- **Component Class (`.ts` file):**
    
    - **What it is:** The logic behind the component template.
    - **Its Job:** To respond to user events (like clicks or text input) and to work with services to manage data.
    - **Example:** The `submit()` function you wrote lived here.
- **Service (`.ts` file):**
    
    - **What it is:** A class dedicated to handling business logic.
    - **Its Job:** To fetch data from a server, save data, or perform any other data-related tasks. This keeps complex logic out of your components.
    - **Example:** The `translate.service.ts` file was created to handle the logic of calling the Google Translate API.
- **Module (`.ts` file):**
    
    - **What it is:** A container or organizer.
    - **Its Job:** To group together related components and services that belong to a specific feature of your application.
    - **Example:** In a large e-commerce app, you might have a `ProductListingModule` and a separate `ShoppingCartModule`.

### 3. How They All Work Together

- A **Component Class** and a **Component Template** always work together as a pair (a 1-to-1 relationship).
- This Component pair is then bundled inside a **Module**.
- The Module also makes **Services** available to the components within it.

### 4. Understanding the "Weird" Syntax

The instructor acknowledged that the code looks strange and clarified what it is:

- **In `.ts` files:** You are writing **TypeScript**, which is a version of JavaScript with added features. The instructor assured you that no prior knowledge is needed and it will be taught from scratch.
- **In `.html` files:** You are using **Angular Template Syntax**, which adds programming capabilities to your HTML. This will also be explained in detail later.

In short, this lesson was designed to give you a **high-level mental model** of an Angular application's structure so you don't feel lost among all the files. The goal was to show you that there is a clear and logical purpose for each piece of the puzzle.
