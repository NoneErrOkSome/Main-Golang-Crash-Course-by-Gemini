Of course. Here is a complete summary of all the setup steps we've covered, from the very beginning to having a project open in VS Code.

### **Summary: Full Angular Development Setup on iMac**

This guide will take you from a fresh Mac to a fully functional Angular development environment.

### **Step 1: Set Up the Core Environment (nvm, Node.js, and npm)**

This is the most reliable way to install Node.js and avoid permission errors.

1. **Install nvm (Node Version Manager):** Open your terminal and run:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
2. **Restart Your Terminal:** Completely close and reopen your terminal window to activate nvm.
    
3. **Install Node.js:** Use nvm to install the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js (which includes npm).
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    nvm install --lts
    ```
    
4. **Verify Installation:** Check that Node.js and npm are working.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
    
    You should see version numbers for both.

### **Step 2: Install the Angular CLI**

With your environment ready, you can now install Angular's command-line tool.

1. **Install the Angular CLI:** Because you used nvm, you do **not** need `sudo`.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
    
2. **Verify Installation:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    ng version
    ```
    
    This should display the Angular CLI version details.

### **Step 3: Create and Run Your First Angular Project**

1. **Create a New Project:** This command will create a new folder named `my-first-app`.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    ng new my-first-app
    ```
    
    You'll be asked a couple of questions; you can just press Enter for the defaults.
    
2. **Navigate into the Project Folder:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd my-first-app
    ```
    
3. **Run the App:** This starts a local development server.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    ng serve
    ```
    
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to see your new app running.

### **Step 4: Configure Visual Studio Code**

This will enable the useful `code .` command for opening projects from your terminal.

1. **Open the VS Code Application.**
    
2. **Open the Command Palette:** Use the shortcut `Shift + Command + P`.
    
3. **Install the Shell Command:** In the search bar that appears, type `shell command` and select the option **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**. Authorize with your password if prompted.
    
4. **Restart Your Terminal:** Close and reopen your terminal one last time.
    
5. **Open Your Project:** You can now open any project folder in VS Code directly from the terminal.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    # Make sure you are in your project's directory
    cd my-first-app
    
    # Open it in VS Code
    code .
    ```

### **(Optional) Step 5: Customize Your Terminal Prompt**

If you want to change your computer's name (`SCs-iMac`) in the terminal prompt:

1. Open **System Settings** > **General** > **Sharing**.
2. Click **Edit...** next to **Local hostname** and set your desired name (e.g., "my-imac").
3. Restart your terminal to see the change.

And that's everything! You now have a complete, professional setup for Angular development on your iMac. Happy coding!
